          Heeding the Ominous Buzz of a Vicious
          Animal

          To the Editor:

          Re "Public Beliefs, Global Politics and
          Pesticides" (Big City column, Sept. 16),
          by John Tierney: The world doesn't have
          time to watch the developed countries
          debate the safety of malathion and DDT.
          Even if we use these chemicals without
          restraint, we will not significantly
          reduce the millions of mosquito-caused
          deaths every year or the millions of
          cases of chronic mosquito-delivered
          infections that people must live with.

          It is far past time to get serious about
          these vicious animals. We have destroyed
          smallpox and almost wiped out polio. We
          are deciphering the genetic code. The
          United States and other countries should
          support an emergency project to apply the
          world's genetic, molecular and
          biochemical knowledge to the total
          eradication of all the mosquitoes in the
          world. Then we would never again be told,
          as we are now, that a child dies of
          malaria every 12 seconds.

          To the Editor:

          John Tierney (Big City column, Sept. 16)
          dismisses more than 30 years of
          scientific evidence about DDT's adverse
          impact on birds, asserting that "some
          scientists" attribute the historic
          decline of eagles and falcons to "other
          factors." In fact, the role of DDT in the
          decline is amply documented. Mean
          concentrations of DDT and its related
          compounds in fish declined by about 90
          percent between 1970 and 1985, a result
          of this country's DDT ban in 1972.
          Eggshell thickness and reproductive
          success of birds that eat the fish
          significantly increased.

          Rachel Carson, who brought the dangers of
          DDT to public attention, was belittled
          and vilified for years by the chemical
          industry. It is dismaying to see her
          reputation tarred again.

          My two sons (ages 3 and 1 1/2) and I were
          among those described in a Sept. 14 news
          article as leaving Riverside Park in a
          rush. We were being directly sprayed with
          malathion by helicopter. According to the
          Office of the Mayor, the spraying of the
          area was a last-minute change to the
          schedule.

          Of course we appreciate the efforts Mayor
          Rudolph W. Giuliani has made in
          controlling the spread of St. Louis
          encephalitis. However, I am outraged that
          the city could caution residents to close
          windows and stay indoors during the
          sprayings and then spread the pesticide
          on several bustling "tot lots" in
          Riverside Park without ample warning.

          To the Editor:

          New York City was right to mount an
          aggressive spraying campaign against
          encephalitis-bearing mosquitoes (news
          article, Sept. 14), but every aggressive
          campaign inevitably inflicts collateral
          damage.

          The spider who so industriously spun one
          web after another in our roof garden this
          summer -- our own Charlotte -- was a
          collateral victim. After we were sprayed,
          I found her lifeless, hanging in her last
          web.

          To the Editor:

          The encephalitis outbreak in New York
          City (news article, Sept. 17) is a vivid
          reminder that current discussions about
          health care financing and managed care
          should not be allowed to overshadow the
          need for continuing investments in public
          health.

          State and local health departments, with
          their preventive role, have been
          neglected. Yet they address problems that
          no individual physician, consumer or
          health maintenance organization can
          solve, from insect control to regulations
          for safe food. Today's infectious
          diseases, of which AIDS and E. coli are
          two more examples, are complex, and
          officials are ill equipped to deal with
          them.
