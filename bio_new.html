the Atlantic.  He is the author of two
  books: <a href="./Chaos/index.html">Chaos and Fractals: An
    Elementary Introduction</a> (Oxford University Press, 2012), a
  textbook for non-math/science majors;
  and <a href="./Dynamics/index.html">Chaos

Dave has developed two MOOCs, one
  on <a href="http://chaos.complexityexplorer.org">Chaos and Dynamical
    Systems</a> and one 
  on <a href="http://fractals.complexityexplorer.org">Fractals and
    Scaling</a>.  These free, online classes are part of the Santa Fe

<!--<h1 align="right">Less Brief</h1>
<p>David Feldman is Professor of Physics and Mathematics at College of
the Atlantic.  He is the author
of <a href="http://chaos.coa.edu">Chaos and Fractals: An Elementary
  Introduction</a> (Oxford University Press, 2012), a textbook for
  non-math/science majors.  He has twice offered a well-received MOOC
  on chaos and dynamics to several thousand students as part of the
  Santa Fe
  Institute's <a href="http://www.complexityexplorer.org/">Complexity
    Explorer</a> project.  Dave was a U.S. Fulbright Lecturer
  in Rwanda in 2011-12, Co-director of the Santa Fe Institute's
  Complex Systems Summer School in Beijing, China from 2006-08, and
  was COA's Associate Dean for Academic Affairs from 2003-06.  He is
  currently working on two book-length projects: A primer on chaos and
  dynamics, and a co-authored interdisciplinary textbook on
  the physics and mathematics of sustainable energy.  In the fall of
  2015 he will offer a MOOC on Fractals and Scaling.

<p>David Feldman received a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in
  1991 and a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California at
  Davis in 1998.  From 1991-1993, he was a teacher of 9th and 10th
  grade physics and mathematics
  at <a href="https://www.mccallie.org/">The McCallie School</a> in
  Chattanooga, TN.  As a graduate student at UC Davis, Dave received
  several awards in recognition of both teaching and scholarship:  the
  Dissertation Year Fellowship; the Chancellor's Teaching Fellowship;
  and he was nominated for the Outstanding Graduate Student Teaching
  Award.</p>  

<p>Dave joined the faculty at College of the Atlantic in 1998.  He
  served as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs from 2003-2007.  At COA
  Dave has taught over twenty different courses in physics, mathematics,
  and computer science.  Together with several other colleagues, in
  2016 he launched the Thoreau Environmental Leaders Initiative, a
  project that supports participatory learning in food systems,
  renewable energy, and climate change politics, and helps give
  students skills in community organizing and activism.  The project
  has been supported by several grants from the Henry David Thoreau
  Foundation totaling $155,000.</p>

<p>Dave is the author of two books:
<a href="http://chaos.coa.edu">Chaos and Fractals: An  
Elementary Introduction</a> (Oxford University Press, 2012), a
textbook for non-math/science majors;
and <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691161525/chaos-and-dynamical-systems">Chaos 
and Dynamical Systems</a> (Princeton University Press, 2019), a
contribution to
the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/series/primers-in-complex-systems">Primers
in Complex Systems</a> series.  Dave has developed two MOOCs, one
on <a href="http://chaos.complexityexplorer.org">Chaos and Dynamical
Systems</a> and one 
on <a href="http://fractals.complexityexplorer.org">Fractals and
Scaling</a>.  These free, online classes are part of the Santa Fe
Institute's <a href="http://www.complexityexplorer.org/">Complexity
Explorer</a> project and have been taken by thousands of
students.
</p>

<p>With Anna E. Demeo, Dave developed and team-taught an introductory
  course on the physics and mathematics of sustainable energy.  Anna
  and Dave received a $95,000 grant from
  the <a href="https://www.msgc.org/">Maine Space Grant 
    Consortium</a> Research and Higher Education Program to support
  the development of the class.  They also received an
  $18,000 grant from the Environmental Education Program of the
  Environmental Protection Agency to develop and teach a workshop on
  sustainable energy for area elementary school teachers. Dave is
  currently working on a textbook on renewable energy.
</p> 



<p>From 2004-2008, Dave gave a week-long series of lectures at the
  China Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS), co-sponsored by the  
  <a href="http://www.santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</a> and the
  <a href="http://english.itp.cas.cn/">Institute of Theoretical
    Physics</a> at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
  <!--His lectures provided students with a broad introduction to
    complex systems, including dynamical systems, information theory,
    and computation theory.  From 2006-2008 he was co-director of the
    China CSSS, collaborating with colleagues at the Chinese Academy
    to oversee all academic and logistical aspects of the program.-->
  He was PI on a $116,000 grant from the U.S. National Science
  Foundation that partially supported 
  the CSSS. Since 2017 Dave has directed the CSSS in Santa Fe, New
  Mexico.  In 2018-19 he served as the Santa Fe Institute's interim
  vice-president for education.</p>

<p>In 2011-12, Dave was a U.S. Fulbright Lecturer in Rwanda.  He held
  an appointment as a visiting professor of Applied Physics at the
  Kigali Institute of Science and Technology</a> (KIST), which is now
  known as the <a href="https://cst.ur.ac.rw/">University of Rwanda,
  College of Sciences and Technology</a>.  At KIST he taught four  
  classes for junior and senior physics majors
<!--: Computational Physics,
  Statistical Physics, Mathematical Physics II, and Atomic and
  Molecular Physics.  He also taught-->
  and an introductory physics course to
  180 chemistry, biology, and food science majors.  </p>

<p>Dave's research interests lie in the fields of statistical
  mechanics and nonlinear dynamics.  In particular, his research has
  examined how one might measure "complexity" or pattern in a
  mathematical system, and how such complexity is related to disorder.
 <!-- This work belongs to the constellation of research topics often
  referred to as "chaos and complex systems."  In his research, Dave
  uses both analytic and computational techniques.-->  Dave has authored
  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwyYMbUAAAAJ&hl=en">research
  papers</a> in journals including Physical Review E, Chaos, and  
  Advances in Complex Systems.  Two of his papers have been cited
  over 400 times.</p>

<p>Dave was a founding member of the Mount Desert Island
  (MDI) <a href="http://rewg.org">Racial Equity Working Group</a> and
  the MDI Racial Justice Collective. He was a member of the steering
  committee of <a href="https://indivisiblemdi.me/">Indivisible
  MDI</a>.  Dave is a member of the Title IX team at College of the
  Atlantic and has completed an <a href="https://atixa.org/">ATIXA</a>
  level two Civil Rights Investigator training.</b>

<p>His other interests include playing ultimate frisbee, watching
  hockey, cooking, travel, and gardening.  He is married
  to Doreen Stabinsky; they have two excellent cats.</p>
