This is only a partial list.  Several faculty did not have the time to
add their activities to this list. It is designed to be representative,
not exhaustive, and is indented to give a broad overview of the range
and extent of professional, research, creative, and community
activities in which College of the Atlantic faculty participate.  This
list was compiled by David Feldman (faculty moderator, 2001-2002), and
is also available online at:
