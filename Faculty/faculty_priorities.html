<B>Methods:</B>  Faculty returned to me a prioritized list of
potential future hires.  I tabulated this data three different ways.
Each method, described in detail below, accounts for the intensity of
people's preferences differently.  Basically, at issue is:  how much
weight should be given to, say, a first place vote over an eighth place
vote?  Should the first place vote count eight times more?  Or maybe
even higher?  I suspect that for many, an eighth place vote was almost
an afterthought.  

<P>
This sort of weighting question is inevitable when trying to develop
voting schemes.  In fact, one can show that, given some fairly
stringent but not unreasonable restrictions, that there's no ideal
voting method in elections with more than three voters and more than
three candidates.  (This is known as Arrow's impossibility theorem.
It was proved by Ken Arrow in the 1950's; he later won the Nobel Prize
in economics for this.)  So, the point is that there's no ``right''
method for tabulating the votes.  So I chose three different methods,
each of which is explained below. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI><B>Method I:</B>  This is the simplest method.  I've just
    counted a first place vote as 13, a second place vote as 12, a
    third place vote as 11, and so on.  This takes into account
    people's preferences, but does in a fairly mild way.
</LI>
<LI><B>Method II:</B> Here I used a system that gave a lot of
    points to the first several choices and then very few to people's
    lower choices.  In particular, I counted voted as follows: ( 28,
    20, 14, 10, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0).  I.e., 28 for first
    place, 20 for second place, ... , 0 for 9-13^th place.   
</LI>
<LI><B>Method III:</B>  For this method I just counted any vote in
    the top five as 1 and any vote lower than five as 0
For example, when I report that African/Asian Studies received 11,
    this means that 11 of us had this position in our top five.  

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
I'm perhaps one of the few people in the world who thinks that
analyzing voting schemes is fascinating.  (It's easy to get a
spreadsheet to do these calculations.) Sorry if the above was overly
technical.  I think that method II makes the most sense.  But what's
really striking from the data is that there's not consensus on this
and we need to do more talking and thinking.  

<P>
Anyway, on the next pages are the results, followed by some summaries
of additional thoughts that people sent me.

<P>
Some observations and summaries of comments people sent to me.
Apologies for oversimplifying and being a little selective with some
of these comments.  

<OL>
<LI>There was a bit of a binary response on the idea of an
additional writing faculty.  Most either had this ranked fairly high
or very low.  Of the writing faculty and faculty who have taught
writing-intensive classes, all had the writing position as either dead
last or as a non-priority.  Those ranking writing high tended to be
faculty who don't teach writing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There was also a bit of a binary response to the idea of a food
systems faculty member.  This received many first and second place
votes and many very low votes.  Only a few faculty were in the middle
on this.  For the most part, those ranking a food systems hire as a
high priority are those faculty who are working in areas related to
agriculture and food.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A few of you commented that some of these positions should be
combined and/or reconfigured.  This was especially the case for human
studies sorts of positions.  A few particular comments that might
warrant further discussion:

<OL>
<LI>Should Asian/African Studies be combined with Religion?
   Several people have proposed this to me.  But, in discussions at
   the retreat this fall, several voiced the opinion that it is
   important to see these as distinct.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Several people commented that the Wiggins governance hire
   might be a way to get some additional U.S.&nbsp;history in our
   curriculum.  Several others commented that they would like to see
   our existing faculty teach more U.S.&nbsp;history.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>My sense is that graduate training in the humanities is
   increasingly interdisciplinary.  This suggests that simply
   looking for a geographer or someone with a degree in religion may
   not be the best way to think about some of these positions.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There were suggestions to consider the following positions
that weren't on the list I sent out:  A hands-on physical science
type (solar energy, biodiesel); Assistant Dean for student life
specializing in health; green business.  Each of these was
suggested once.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>At least three faculty mentioned a desire for the
role of GIS in our curriculum to be clarified, and that maybe
thinking about a geography position may help with this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Many people included in their responses a desire to discuss
these positions further, so as to better understand what their
colleagues perceive as needs in the curriculum.
