<ol>

<li>  Announcements
<ol>
	<li> Update on Luce Grant
	<li> Report on governance initiative/chair potluck Monday
	<li> Retreat Logistics
	<li> Report on Governance initiative liaison committee meeting. <p>
</ol>

<li>  Depending on time, we'll do some of the following:
<ol>
 <li> Preparation for next week's retreat
 <li>  Initial, brief discussion of the epidemic of students
	with incompletes
	<li> Initial, brief discussion of various possible forms of
	affiliation with Audubon Expedition Institute
	</ol>
[Both items B and C will be initial discussions; the goal isn't to decide
anything.  Moreover, it seems to me that both of these are the purview of 
the academic affairs committee.  Any decision on these things would be 
made by them and then brought to ACM as a minute or a proposal in winter
or spring.]<p>


<li>  (9:05)  Fran appears.  Presentation of gift.  Kind words spoken.
