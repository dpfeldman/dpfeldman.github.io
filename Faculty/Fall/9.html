<li>  No Announcements<P>

<li>  Signing of a card for Ander.  (N.b.: this is an activity, not an
announcement.) <p>

<li>  Discussion of our retreat about human ecology.  A subgroup has
written a draft of a summary of some areas of agreement.  We'll use 
this as a discussion piece.  Look for a draft in your email tomorrow.<p>

As we agreed at the end of the retreat, I've invited several 
administrators and staff.  Steve Katona, Sarah Baker, Donna McFarland, 
Carroll Gordon, Becky Buyers-Basso, and Dorothy Knapp, will all be joining 
us.  I'm not exactly sure how we'll conduct this discussion -- I suspect 
we'll start in small groups and then have a larger conversation. <p>
