Here's a document which should give some idea of what I'm up to:<p>
<ul>
<li>Statement of <a href="research.html"> Research Interests</a>.  (html)<br>
<!-- <li><a href="outline.ps.Z">Overview </a>of my
orals presentation. (Compressed PostScript.) <p> -->
</ul>This is kinda old and doesn't fully reflect my current thinking.  An
updated statement of research interests is on the way.<p>

My research has been carried out with the collaboration of
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu:80/~jpc/"> Jim Crutchfield</a>.  
An <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/projects/CompMech/"> archive </a> 
of work done by him and his <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/projects/CompMech/html/CompMechGroup.html"> 
group </a>is available.<p>

It also seems as if <a href="complexity.dilbert.gif"> Dilbert </a> has
been doing some work in this area. <img src="dilbert.gif">
