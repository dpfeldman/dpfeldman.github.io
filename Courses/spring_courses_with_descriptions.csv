"Tsygankova, Valeria ",Animals and Arguments,W HS,Introductory,"In 1903, American naturalist John Burroughs triggered a fierce public debate when he accused some of his peers of writing “sham natural history.” These other naturalists, Burroughs claimed, had given in to the major temptation lying in wait for all nature writers: “the danger of making too much of what we see and describe—of putting in too much sentiment, too much literature—in short, of valuing these things more for the literary effects we can get out of them than for themselves.” The ensuing debate over the responsible depiction of nonhuman nature went on for five years in the pages of popular magazines, drawing in dozens of writers and one U.S. president. More than a century later, we remember it as the “nature faker” controversy. But though this episode has taken its place in the history books, its unresolved tensions and questions live on, occupying nature writers and filmmakers to this day: How can writers tell stories that spark human interest in the natural world while doing justice to that world’s alterity? What does it mean to value nonhuman animals “for themselves” and not for the reasons we might project onto them? Are emotion and imagination incompatible with good nature writing? In this writing class, students will not only get to know this longstanding conversation; they will also be asked to weigh in. Students will study the strategies that help experienced writers make their own marks on existing debates: strategies for posing rich problems, analyzing texts, representing and responding to other voices, giving and using feedback, and otherwise developing a sustainable writing practice. Students will become better navigators of writing for various contexts and audiences by studying and practicing the ways in which public and scholarly writers convey their ideas to readers. Students will be evaluated on a rhetorical analysis of a single text; an analytical essay that incorporates multiple sources and makes an original argument; a reflection that analyzes their own approach to writing; participation in in-class work; and the completion of short, low-stakes assignments preparing them for class. This course will be helpful for new college students looking to establish a base of knowledge about analytical writing, as well as for students at any point in their college careers who want to dedicate some time to working on their writing.Level: Introductory.

"Breslow, Peter","Audio Journalism: Reporting, Producing, Storytelling",HS,Intermediate,"This will be a ""soup to nuts"" course in audio journalism geared towards the beginner. In this class we will detail: how to record and edit audio; interviewing techniques; writing for broadcast; how to voice a script—all leading to the creation of an NPR style piece. This is very much a journalism class. Through a series of ever more challenging assignments – both individual and with a partner; in class and out – students will not only acquire the expertise to produce a compelling radio piece, but come to understand the ethics of audio journalism. The format for the course will be a hands-on workshop with a heavy workload of reporting assignments that we will critique together in review sessions. A significant amount of a student's time outside of class will be dedicated to reporting stories, editing audio and writing scripts followed by individual edit sessions with the instructor. We will also be hearing from a number of noted journalists who will Zoom into the class on a broad range of topics. Students will be evaluated on their timely completion of assignments, overall improvement, their constructive engagement with group critique sessions and Zoom guest speakers, and their follow-up on edit suggestions from the instructor. This class is open to all students interested in journalism and audio production. There are no prerequisites, though prior experience in journalism, narrative writing or audio recording and production is helpful. Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: None. Class limit: 10.

"Soares, Zachary",Audio Production as Compositional Tool,ADS,Introductory,"In 1979, the music producer Brian Eno argued that the recording studio is a “compositional tool,” upending the idea that the recording studio exists to document pre-existing musical compositions. His assertion came on the back of pivotal albums such as The Beatles’ “Revolver” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966), which demonstrated the creative possibilities of composing in the studio. We might call this type of approach to music composition “playing the studio.” In this course, students learn how music production makes use of editing, mixing, and effect processing to maximize its impact. Through readings, film screenings, and audio listening sessions, students learn about past and present studio techniques and use these techniques during audio projects and exercises. Students learn to use virtual instruments, effect processors, microphones, and COA’s recording studio to strengthen their technical audio recording, editing, and mixing skills. Students will be evaluated based on their participation in class discussions, their fluency in the use of recording equipment and software, the process they use to approach each assignment, and the completion of assigned projects. No prerequisites or sound/music experience is required.Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None. Class limit: 10. Lab fee: None. Meets the following degree requirements: ADS.",
"Todd, Sean",Biology: Form and Function,ES,Introductory,"This is one half of a 20-week, two-term introductory course in biology, providing an overview of the discipline and prerequisite for many intermediate and advanced biology courses. The course will emphasize biological structures at the level of whole organisms and organs and their role in the survival and reproduction of individuals and the evolution of populations . We will explore principles of evolution, classification, anatomy and physiology, epidemiology, behavior, and basic ecology. The primary focus of the course is on vertebrate animals and vascular plants, but we will make forays into other phylogenetic lineages at intervals. Weekly field and laboratory studies introduce students to the local range of habitats and a broad array of protists, plants, and animals. Attendance at two lectures and one lab each week is required; course evaluation is based on class participation, exams, preparation of a lab/field notebook, and a presentation. It should be stressed that this course emphasizes the unity of the organism within its environment. Ideally students will subsequently enroll in Biology:Cells and Molecules in order to further their exploration of issues in a more reductionist form, but neither course is a pre-requisite for the other.

"Lakey, Heather",Buddhist Philosophies,HS,Introductory,"What is the nature of self? What is the nature of mind? Why do we suffer? What is enlightenment? This course introduces students to the foundations of Buddhist philosophy and practice. Buddhism encompasses a variety of different traditions, teachings, practices, and goals. In this class, we will adopt a philosophical perspective to explore a range of Buddhist thinking on topics such as reality, consciousness, nothingness, and ethical conduct. We will begin by reading Asvagho?a's Buddhacarita, which tells the story of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha. Next, we will study the Theravada, Buddhism's foundational structure, and then proceed to explore the later Mahayana teachings. This course will study primary literature, including excerpts from the Pali Canon and several Mahayana sutras, alongside selections from contemporary thinkers such as Thích Nhat Hanh, angel Kyodo williams, and Pema Chödrön. Along the way, we will discuss suffering (dukkha), emptiness (suññata), impermanence (anicca), non-self (anatta), interdependence or dependent uprising (pa?iccasamuppada), desire (tanha), the four noble truths, the eightfold path, liberation and enlightenment (nibbana), action and causation (kamma), wisdom (pañña), compassion (karuna and bodhicitta), and our responsibilities to other beings. Although this course primarily focuses on Buddhist theory and Buddhist texts, students will be briefly introduced to different meditation and mindfulness practices through a series of guest speakers and a weekend visit to the Morgan Bay Zendo in Surry, Maine. This course will be conducted in seminar style with an emphasis on class participation. No prior background in Buddhism or philosophy is required.

"Neuhouser, Jeffry",Career Ecology Seminar,,Introductory,"In this course, students will develop a deep understanding of how their personal and professional identities intersect, how to apply and communicate their skills and interests through career experiences, and how to navigate a fulfilling and purposeful life. Students will first and foremost learn to look at their career development through the lens of career ecology, which is applying human ecology as a lens to examine one’s career experiences and professional identity within natural, social, and economic systems. The goal of seeing career development through a career ecology lens is to construct strong identity foundations and continue on a path to professional authenticity, finding one’s sense of purpose, and career fulfillment. This course is designed to meet all students where they are in their COA journey: from first-year exploration through seniors preparing for graduation. This class is useful before you complete your internship requirement, but can also help you prepare for post-graduation success. Students will learn how their career ecosystems and professional identities are deeply influenced by one's familial, cultural, regional, religious, historical, and spiritual experiences, as well as by personal beliefs, views, strengths, and abilities. We will further investigate ways in which one participates in ecosystems through paid work, volunteering, government service, research, writing, community service, leadership, and how to find mentorship and support. Students will learn through written reflections, participating in course discussions on readings and with course visitors, completing career assessments like the Clifton Strengths to understand personal strengths and values, completing professional writing assignments like resumes and cover letters, participating in hands-on networking and interviewing practice, and reading and incorporating design thinking strategies from the text Designing Your Life (Burnett & Evans, 2016). Evaluation and assessment will be based on active participation in course discussions (discussions on readings and with course visitors), completing professional writing assignments (e.g., resumes and cover letters), reflection essays, and oral presentations.

"Capers, Colin",Cinematic Visions from Marginalized Peoples,AD,Introductory,"Production modes, market concerns, and privilege of access, in addition to the greater concerns of racism, sexism, classism and other social biases have all historically contributed to the predominance of a narrow range of cinematic voices being experienced by most audiences. But from the dawn of cinema there have been those working on the edges to realize visions that speak to many modes of otherness and to different manners of being, of belonging. In this class we will investigate a range of diverse moving image works and engage with texts that help contextualize and elucidate the works and the creative impulses/individuals behind them. The roster of movies viewed this term will be chosen collaboratively from a curated list by the group at the beginning of the term so as to most effectively engage with the particular interests of this configuration of students; choices include (but are not limited to) films and videos made by and about members of the following communities: LGBTQ+, neurodiversity, seniors, economically disadvantaged, homeless, people with disabilities, people of faith, Inuit, Roma, Sami, Maya, Palawan, Amhara, African diaspora, Indigenous peoples of the US and Australia. Focus will be primarily on narrative forms, but some works with experimental aspects may be featured. Potential filmmakers include: Samira Makhmalbaf, David Gulpilil, Cheryl Dunye, Tony Gatlif, Euzhan Palcy, Haile Gerima, Mati Diop, Derek Jarman.

"Hall, Sarah",Climate and Weather,ES,Intermediate,"This class will explore general weather and climate patterns on global, regional, and local scales. We will discuss the major forcings driving global climate fluctuations - on both long (millions of years) and short (days) timescales, including natural and anthropogenic processes. We will also learn about basic meteorology and the processes producing some common spectacular optical weather phenomena (rainbows, coronas, cloud-types, etc). Students will complete a term project comprising a photo-documentary journal of the different weather phenomena they observe during the 10-week term. The field component of this course will be self-guided through the observation and documentation of weather phenomena. Who should take this course: No prior geology/science experience is needed - but expect to do a bit of basic math in this course! The course level is intermediate because it will not cover foundational principles of geology (or other sciences) but instead the course will be integrative and require students to practice both their quantitative and qualitative skills. Take this course if you are passionate or curious about climate change, but do not know much about the science of climate and weather!",
"Little-Siebold, Todd",Coasts and Shores: A Seminar in the Human Ecology of Place,HS,Intermediate/Advanced,"In recent scholarship on humans’ relationship with the sea, a rich and varied set of approaches has emerged, showing how this land-sea interface has been central to human stories, lives, and world-making. Using John Gillis’s innovative work in The Human Shore as a foundation, this course will explore the work of a wide range of scholars across many disciplines, such as history, geology, literature, indigenous studies, art, and marine science, etc., to examine the differences between a coast and a human shore. We will cover topics as diverse as the indigenous lives along the coasts over time, the geologic formation of coastlines, and the portrayal of coasts in Shakespeare. Thus, the course will interrogate the human experience of these spaces from a range of disciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives. Visitors from the blue humanities and other areas will enrich the class with their work and perspectives, helping students think through both their work and how they do it.

"Taneja, Palak",College Seminar: Women in True Crime,W HS,Introductory,"Commercialized in the 16th century through ballads and pamphlets, true crime has been around for a bit. Yet it is in the recent decade or so, with the proliferation of streaming services, social media, and the popularity of podcasts as a genre, that we see a rising interest among women both in the production and consumption of true crime. Statistics vary depending on the source, but the general consensus is that somewhere between 65-80% of the audience for true crime is women. What then is the root of this fascination? What role does gender play in it? And how do we wrap our minds around this phenomenon and the elements—violence, sensationalism, exploitation of victims—that come along with it? These are but some of the questions that we will delve into in this class.Using a genre-based approach, we will study and analyze women-centric true crime books, case files, articles, blogs, podcasts, and documentaries. Our focus will not only be on the content of these works, but also on the forces that shape the writing/composing process: that is, the purpose (awareness, entertainment, reporting, etc.), the intended audience (detectives, true crime enthusiasts, academics, etc.), and the like. For example, when we read I’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and watch the show by the same name, we will devote time to understanding and writing about the stylistic choices that might be particular to a genre, here a non-fiction book and documentary, respectively. Some other examples of works that we would look at are Crime Junkie by Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, and Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer by Liz Garbus. The study of the form and peculiarities of these genres, along with the textbook, Understanding Rhetoric, will help us develop both the vocabulary and the skills to understand and work on our own writing process. This process will be honed further through writing assignments in various genres—in-class freewrites, newspaper reports, crime blogs, reading responses, paper, portfolio reflection letter, and a multimodal project—and a sustained practice of the art of peer-reviewing and revision. In short, you will critically read, think, and write about women in true crime with the end goal of developing skills that will serve you well outside the limits of our theme.Assessment will be based on writing assignments in various genres– in-class freewrites, newspaper reports, crime blogs, reading responses, paper, portfolio reflection letter, and a multimodal project–and a sustained practice of the art of peer-reviewing and revision.

"Buchanan, Rebecca",Culturally Sustaining and Revitalizing Education,HS ED,Intermediate,"This course is designed for students planning to teach in schools whether in Maine or outside of the United States. Culturally sustaining/revitalizing education (CSRE) builds on the aims, values, insights, and practices of anti-racist education, culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, culturally sustaining/revitalizing pedagogy, decolonizing education, global education, intercultural education, and multicultural education. In particular, it aims to contextualize education in the history of colonization, land theft, slavery, the continued struggle for sovereignty and self-determination of native tribes and First Nations, and calls for wider community accountability. This educational approach challenges deficit mindsets and structures that undergird policies and practices that widen the opportunity gap and equitable access to basic human and civil rights and impede educational access for sustaining and revitalizing cultures that settler colonialism has attempted to eliminate, assimilate, or marginalize. Students will practice asset-based and growth mindsets to gain an understanding of the relationship between CSRE and respect for tribal sovereignty and support of contemporary struggles for tribal continuity and resistance to cultural genocide and epistemicide. The course also opens a dialogue on the applicability of CRSE for immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking students whose relationship to their new place of residence may be tenuous at best and whose heritage languages and cultures are also endangered as a result of first- to second-generation assimilation in their adopted communities. Students will gain an understanding of conceptual frameworks, knowledge of empirical studies documenting outcomes and impacts of these approaches, and skills in ethically and effectively teaching indigenous, immigrant, and other culturally and linguistically diverse learners. For students seeking Maine teaching endorsements, this course will prepare them to implement LD291 requiring Maine educators to teach Wabanaki history and culture. Students will learn through field trips, guest speakers, films, discussions, critical exploration and reflection, independent research, observation/fieldwork/practicum, and peer teaching. Evaluation will include artifacts to be incorporated into a teaching portfolio: a lesson plan, teaching video, self-assessment, assessment of PK-12 student work, and communication with families and community members. Although there are no prerequisites, the following are recommended; Learning and/or proficiency in a language other than English; a psychology, sociology, or anthropology course; and/or a prior education course.

"Slabach, Brittany",Curatorial Practice: Study Skins,ES,Introductory/Intermediate,"This course provides a deep dive into the practice and art of preparing museum study skins. Study skins are a traditional form of specimen preparation that preserves the skin and feathers of organisms for research purposes. Preparation techniques vary by taxon and research objective. In this course we will read about the history of study skins, how preparation techniques have evolved over time, and the role of study skins in our understanding of our natural world. A foundational component of the course is to learn how to prepare study skins. Therefore, we will establish a practice of preparing study skins weekly. Through this practice students will learn different techniques of preparation, as well as gain a strong foundation in anatomy related to different organisms and learn how to use appropriate anatomical language. The course meeting time is structured to support this weekly practice. While we will discuss preparation techniques for different taxons, iterative practice of techniques will depend on availability of organismal specimens and will be biased towards vertebrates, particularly mammals and aves. Assessments will include a reflection journal documenting each student’s preparatory journey; discussion and activity participation; and the completion of a series of study skins demonstrating improvement in technique over the course of the term. This course builds on concepts discussed in Collecting Nature, and other organismal courses. The course is particularly suitable for students who would like to pursue careers in organismal ecology, taxonomy, or museum studies, and would like study skin preparation to be a part of their skillset. It would also serve students who are interested in gaining an in-depth knowledge of organismal anatomy, or those who are interested in different preparation techniques.Level: Introductory/Intermediate.

"Schultz, Eloise",Curriculum Design and Assessment,HS ED,Advanced,"Human ecologists who educate, embrace not only the interdisciplinarity of knowledge, but also the complexity of individual student development in political school environments. This course focuses on two essential nuts and bolts of teaching: curriculum design and assessment. How can a teacher learn what students know, how they think, and what they have learned? How can a teacher use this knowledge of students and subject matter to plan learning experiences that will engage diverse interests, adapt to a wide range of learning styles and preferences, accommodate exceptional needs, and meet state-mandated curriculum standards? This course is a required course for prospective secondary school teachers that provides an introduction to the backward design process and diverse assessment strategies. Students will engage in examining theory and practice designing and implementing curricula and assessments. A service-learning component will provide students with the opportunity to observe and participate in a variety of assessment methods in the subject they aim to teach.

"Gadeken, Kara",Experimental Marine Science Methods,ES,Intermediate/Advanced,"Contemporary marine science research relies on a rapidly developing world of aquatic technologies, yet there has also been a recent revolution in low-cost, DIY electronics and components. For experimentalists, there is immense value in having a broad knowledge of the assorted tools in your methodological “toolkit”. Often, the instrument to collect the data you need doesn’t exist or is unaffordable, in which case the best option may be to build it yourself. Learning how to operate, fix, or even construct instruments to answer a research question builds a strong and interconnected foundation of scientific skills, both concrete (programming, simple electronics, instrumentation, machining, and engineering) and cognitive (critical thinking, creative problem solving, cost-benefit analysis, forethought, resilience, and the “methods” part of the scientific method).In this course you will (1) practice the practical and cognitive skills that experimental marine scientists use to do research, and (2) learn how to design and construct custom aquatic instrumentation to answer a scientific question. The course will start with you constructing a simple aquatic sensor to build basic skills, move on to creating a lab setup designed to manipulate some aspect of the aquatic environment, and end with self-directed research projects devising and building an instrument to explore your own scientific question. Much of our class time will be spent in a collaborative learning setting similar to a research group. Throughout the course, we will explore the ways that creative custom instrumentation can push the boundaries of science and make high-quality research more accessible.This is a project-based course that is intended for STEM-motivated students. It would serve particularly well to bridge students into pursuing more advanced scientific research endeavors.This class is very much a group effort, and assessment will be based on active participation in class experiences as well as written assignments in the style of a technical report, short weekly reflections, and a presentation at an end-of-term symposium. In addition to class meetings, expect to spend a substantive amount of time outside of class working on your projects.Level: Intermediate/Advanced.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques.

"Longsworth, Gordon",Geographic Information Systems I: Foundations & Applications,HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Pre-requisites: Basic computer literacy.

"Ialeggio, Anna",Growth & Decay: Ecological Sculpture,ADS,Introductory,"How might a sculpture decay or grow, becoming an active part of its environment? How might biomimicry offer us tactics for surprising or outsmarting ourselves? What could it mean to make an artwork in an “erosive” or “sedimentary” way? What creative possibilities can follow an unforeseen or catastrophic change? This sculpture course takes its cues from the many processes occurring spontaneously in the natural world: growth, decay, metamorphosis, erosion, accretion, collapse, drift, and more. We will work in tandem with natural processes as both practical and conceptual methodologies. A series of individual and collaborative projects will prompt experiments in eco-sculptural production which engage our own lived experiences of the natural world with criticality and emotion. Expect to encounter familiar materials (wood, textiles, clay) as well as some that may be new (plant matter, paper pulp, recycled and discarded objects, etc). Ideally, this class will collectively make a sculptural contribution to the campus, addressing ecological themes and issues particular to our bioregion and community.Evaluation is based on participation in class activities (exercises, presentations, readings, discussions, occasional writing and/or drawing prompts), significant studio time outside of class, timely completion of all projects with corresponding group critique sessions, and consistent involvement with studio maintenance.

"Cline, Ken",Hydro Politics in a Thirsty World,HS,Advanced,"This course will look at the complex issues surrounding the development, distribution, use and control of fresh water around the world. Focusing primarily on developing countries, we will examine three aspects of water use and control. First we will look at the scope and impact of water development projects; second we will examine the conflicts and solutions related to transboundary river basins; and third we will consider the implication of privatization of water resources. By way of background, we will review the variety of demands placed on fresh water and the political institutions related to water development. Students will gain a solid background in international environmental law as it relates to multilateral and bilateral treaties, customary law, multilateral institutions, and the guidance of international ""soft law"". They will also understand the allocation and equity issues surrounding the privatization of water and the political dimensions of this shift. Ultimately, these issues will give a concrete understanding of some aspects of the concept of sustainable development. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short analytical papers, and a substantial term-long assignment.",
"Feldman, David",Introduction to Chaos and Fractals,ES QR,Introductory,"This course presents an elementary introduction to chaos and fractals. The main focus will be on using discrete dynamical systems to illustrate many of the key phenomena of chaotic dynamics: stable and unstable fixed and periodic points, deterministic chaos, bifurcations, and universality. A central result of this study will be the realization that very simple non-linear equations can exhibit extremely complex behavior. In particular, a simple deterministic system (i.e., physical system governed by simple, exact mathematical rules) can behave in a way that is unpredictable and random, (i.e., chaotic). This result suggests that there are potentially far-reaching limits on the ability of science to predict certain phenomena. Students in this class will also learn about fractals---self-similar geometric objects---including the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets. We will also read about and discuss the development of the field of chaos. In so doing, we will examine the nature of scientific communities, with a particular eye toward how changes in scientific outlooks occur. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to explore the relations between chaos, fractals, and other areas of study such as literature, art, and cultural studies. Students who successfully complete this class should gain a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the basic ideas of chaos and fractals, a greater understanding of the cultural practice of science, and improved mathematical skills. Evaluation will be based on class and lab participation, weekly problem sets several short writing assignments and a final project.Level: Introductory.

"Gagnon da Silva, Pamela",Introduction to Feminist Therapy: Practices and Principles,HS,Introductory,"Feminist Therapy is focused on empowerment through self-awareness and self-assertion as shaped by an understanding of the larger social and political constructs that influence our thoughts and behaviors. In practice the application of feminist therapy synthesizes tenets of gender-based psychology, psychosocial theories of lifespan development, multicultural analysis, and applied social change activism with the objective of self evolution in relation to personal, social, political, and cultural exchanges.This course offers an overview of the origins and applications of feminist therapy as a conceptual framework developed in response to androcentric therapies. We will begin by acknowledging the forerunners of feminist therapy such as Karen Horney and Leta Stetter Hollingworth. We will continue studying the contributions of contemporary feminist therapists such as Ellyn Kaschak, Lenore E. Walker, Jean Baker Miller, and Laura Brown, including prominent contributions by women of color in clinical psychology such as the work of Ruth Winifred Howard and Ellen Kitch Childs, and those who are currently pioneering the development of women’s psychology in other countries such as Vindhya Undurti. We will explore the core principles of feminist therapy, and the influences and implications of power and gender biases at play in clinical practice throughout assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Students will have the opportunity to learn about feminist therapeutic techniques.The objective of the course is to aid students in developing a functional knowledge of feminist therapy and its various clinical applications. Students who have a desire to pursue psychotherapy and social work are encouraged to consider this course as a means of understanding the benefit of feminist therapy in the development of egalitarian therapeutic relationships.The class format includes lectures, roleplays, media presentations, interviews with guest speakers, group work, and discussions.

"Stephenson, Toby",Introduction to Marine Navigation,QR,Introductory,"This is an introductory course that teaches students the principles and primary skills of navigation in coastal waters, utilizing compasses, charts, electronic plotters, radar, and, to some extent, quadrants. This will happen through a combination of theoretical, celestial, loxodromic, and radio navigation,and the practical: charting courses on paper, steering courses on the water, and the construction of traditional navigation instruments that help to cement the value of using angles for reading positions relative to celestial objects. The first half of the course will be devoted to early history and the theoretical, and practical, art of navigation; the second half of the course will focus on constructing instruments, such as cross-staffs and backstaffs, and participating in fieldwork aboard the college’s MV Osprey, putting skills to practice. We will explore, to a limited degree, modern methods of navigation by using radar and GPS, and we will visit the Maine Maritime Academy simulator for a virtual experience piloting a large ship in congested waters. The main focus will be to cement primary navigation skills and knowledge so that students are comfortable conducting small vessel navigation on local waters by the end of the course. This course is open to all students interested in navigation and is particularly suited for those considering maritime careers. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to: understand the fundamental principles of navigation; plot courses of travel, fix a position and perform dead reckoning calculations; appreciate the role of celestial movements and magnetic variations that influence navigation; and use hand tools to craft instruments used in early navigation.

"Nguyen, Duc Hien",Introduction to Political Economy,HS,Introductory,"This course introduces students to the study of political economy from a Marxist perspective. Unlike economics which focuses on various parts of the economy, whether at the micro- or macro- level, political economy focuses on the intertwining of power and money, or how politics affects the economic system and how the economy in turn shapes politics. As most of the world now lives with variants of the capitalist economic system, we will devote our time to study the structure of capitalism, its logics, as well as its contradictions and malfunctions. We will do so by engaging with Karl Marx’s original writings, which to this day still constitute one of the most fundamental and insightful critiques of the capitalist economic system. Marx’s Capital, Volume One will be both our guiding posts and a useful entry point for thinking about a wide range of issues, including labor and value, commodity fetishism and consumerism, capital accumulation and exploitation, and the ongoing violence of accumulation through dispossession, colonization, and other means.As Eric Wolf, the late anthropologist, has noted, “the social sciences constitute one long dialogue with the ghost of Marx” (Europe and the People without History, 1982). Rather than being Marx’s disciples, we strive to be his interlocutor. As such, in addition to selections from Marx’s key works, we also read current Marxian political economy scholarship that draws on, critiques, and pushes its boundaries This course is valuable for any students who are interested in politics, economics, international development, future study, food systems, climate justice, social changes, and any area of studies that grapple with capitalism in its transnational, racialized, and gendered dimensions. Upon completion, students will have developed practices of thinking critically and imaginatively about capitalism’s fundamental drives, uneven development, appetite for technological innovation, and tendency towards violent expansion. No previous knowledge is required, but students should be prepared to read complex, abstract texts. Students will be evaluated through bi-weekly reading reviews (approximately 3-5 pages of critical reflection based on assigned readings) and a final project.Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None.

"Anderson, John",Island Life,ES HY,Intermediate/Advanced,"Islands have played a major role in the development of ecological and evolutionary theory. Most recently, islands have served as an important metaphor in the development of conservation biology. Maine is blessed with a plethora of islands -between 4500 and 6000 at the last count- and the history and pre-history of these islands is intimately entwined with that of the continent itself. This course examines historical and current interpretations of island biogeography and the interplay between natural and human history and human ecology. The class will be taught as a combination of term-time seminar and in the field, based on the College's field station on Great Duck Island and the College's research vessel. During the Spring term we will be meeting regularly to examine the theoretical basis of Island Biogeography and islands as the subject of scientific and literary discussion since Aristotle. Readings will include Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace, and contemporary authors. In late August we will re-convene for the field component of the class. During the first half of this component, we will be focusing primarily on Great Duck Island and its immediate surroundings, learning and applying theoretical approaches to islands' landscapes, with extensive reading from the primary literature. During the second half of the class, we will move further afield, exploring a variety of islands in eastern Maine, and relating our observations to theoretical predictions. Ultimately we hope to travel to Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy to observe a large island community, see the traditional weir fishery, and observe firsthand migrating right and humpback whales, and northern seabirds.

"Sullivan , Leeann ","Mutual Aid, Past, and Future",HS,Intermediate/Advanced,"Contemporary political theory often explores how our established institutions drive seemingly intractable forms of ecological degradation and social harms. These critiques can offer potent models for pathologizing the injustices around us, but—by their magnitude—are also exhausting, making it difficult to imagine alternative ways of living together. As climate change disrupts our food systems, as pathogenic diseases spread and mutate, as social conflict grows, how can we possibly dream of more just and sustainable futures when we are regularly consumed with what it takes just to survive?In this highly interactive course, we will explore one possible answer to this question by considering whether mutual aid—both as an idea and as a really-existing practice—offers any useful speculative and technical tools for responding to our emerging “polycrisis”. We will first theorize mutual aid through a biological lens as a tactic of survival among species, and situate this theory in historical and social context. We will then explore mutual aid as an emergent practice that is always already occurring around us, and conclude by discussing the potentialities it opens (and those that it doesn't) for imaging alternative futures within, without, and around our existing institutions. Students in this course will be expected to read and reflect on high-level theoretical texts, participate actively in classroom discussion, and engage in community and campus-level projects that mirror our classroom discussions. Students will also conduct and self-publish original research on how mutual aid networks emerge in domains such as food, medical care, and community support work. Evaluation will be collaborative, based on engagement and intellectual growth and application of themes both in and outside of the classroom. Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites: While we will briefly review critical theory as a thematic lens, students should enter the class with some existing knowledge of the subject and its applications to food systems, environmental justice, and/or contemporary social problems.

"Edwards, Torrie ",Object-Oriented Programming: Computer Game Design,QR,Introductory/Intermediate,"Object-oriented programming is a design paradigm that encapsulates variables and functions into structures called objects. Understanding what objects are, how to use them, and how to write your own objects, is a foundational programming skill. An application area in which objects naturally occur is game design. The computer gaming industry is a multi billion dollar industry that combines art, sound, and computing into one package. In part, it is thanks to the computer game market that we have seen rapid advances in computer graphics and compute speed. Computer games are event-driven programs; meaning the sequence of operations is not predetermined but is controlled by the user’s mouse clicks or text responses to prompts. In this class students will develop a computer game as a means to learn object-oriented and event-driven programming. Students who successfully complete this course will gain: 1)a grounding in object-oriented design, 2) an introduction to finite state machines and event driven programming, and 3) experience transforming an idea into a working computer game prototype. Students will gain Python coding experience and general skills that leave them better equipped to pursue a wide range of programming tasks. This course is intended for students who have some computer experience and are interested in independently learning new skills.

"Rand, Kendra",Public Speaking Workshop,HS,Introductory,"Consider all the ways that public speaking could be a part of your academic and professional paths: presenting your research, sitting on a webinar panel, speaking up at ACM, advocating for an urgent cause or policy, preparing your senior project presentation, delivering a formal address at a special occasion, or even deciding to perform spoken word at an open-mic. This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of. Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly. This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for public communication. Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits. The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other. This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches. Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation. All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course. This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches. Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None.

"Letcher, Susan",Restoration Ecology,ES,Intermediate,"The Society for Ecological Restoration defines ecological restoration as “the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.” In this era of widespread environmental degradation, restoration ecology provides an important set of methods for mitigating anthropogenic damage. However, the science of restoration is still in its early phases, and important theoretical and practical questions remain to be resolved. This class will critically examine the assumptions that underlie restoration planning, both in the ethical dimension and in the realm of scientific theory. We will consider the validity of conceptual models of ecological communities and ecosystems and the way that these models shape decision-making. We will survey the factors that must be taken into account during restoration and study best-practices approaches, with a focus on adaptive management.

It is an objective of the course to communicate that teaching is intellectual work, that it requires a dedication to and a love of subject matter, a respect and caring for students, a concern for equity, and a moral imperative for excellence in teaching. Students spend 70 hours with their target population and curriculum, as well as consulting with content faculty. (Some of these hours may be reserved for fall term.) These learning-teaching experiences are integrated into class discussion where students analyze the elements needed for successful teaching, learning, and assessing in their own content area and across disciplines. The purposes, problems, opportunities, issues, strategies, and materials involved in teaching diverse adolescent and young adult learners will be examined critically, and students will be evaluated through class discussions, individual and group work, reflections on field experiences, and peer and virtual teaching and assessing.

"Letcher, Susan",Sheep to Shawl,,Intermediate,"Sheep play profoundly important roles in human societies. This course is a human ecological exploration of sheep and wool, combined with a hands-on component in which we will work with sheep and learn fiber arts. This class will meet for one studio session and two lecture/discussion sections per week, plus at least one Saturday field trip. In the studio sessions, we will study sheep husbandry through visits to Peggy Rockefeller Farm, and learn a variety of techniques for working with wool, from the preparation (shearing, washing, and carding) to spinning and working with yarn (including knitting, crochet, and weaving). The lecture/discussion sessions will cover topics such as the ecological impacts of sheep in different parts of the world, the physics of spinning and the chemistry of dyes, and the symbolism of sheep in the mythology of different cultures. The course will draw on a wide range of material and intellectual approaches, with sheep and wool as the unifying theme. Students will be evaluated based on participation, short written assignments, and a final oral presentation. No prior knowledge of fiber craft is necessary, but students who come in knowing one of the basic techniques may be able to explore advanced techniques like lacework or design in three dimensions. Students should meet with the instructor before spring break to discuss goals and equipment needs for the studio sessions. Some basic supplies will be provided, but students should plan to purchase additional equipment such as knitting needles depending on the projects that they choose.Level: Intermediate.

"Clinger, Catherine",Studio Printmaking,ADS,Intermediate/Advanced,"Printmaking is the process of transferring an image from one surface to another. A print mirrors the surface whence it came and also performs as a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking. Students will acquire basic skills as printmakers with an emphasis on relief (woodcut and linocut) and intaglio (line etching, engraving and aquatint) techniques. They will also develop a broad understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper. Students will be evaluated on their projects, participation in critiques, level of engagement with materials, ability to work in a collaborative studio, and final project.

"McLean, Adam",Teaching and Learning Music in Human Ecology,,Introductory/Intermediate,"Music has been a powerful component of human ecology since time immemorial. It can carry our stories, express our values, communicate aspects of our individual and communal identities, and help us understand those of others. Consequently, the ways that music has been transmitted across generations have had profound impacts on the course of humanity. Understanding how and why music is taught and learned is, therefore, crucial to understanding human ecology. Using transdisciplinary resources from social studies, musicology, education studies, neuroscience, and more, this course will explore how people learn music, what people learn through music, and how musical teaching practices can reflect and shape the cultural identities of individual learners and their communities. In addition to taking part in seminars centered around multimedia course materials, students in this course will observe and engage in music teaching and learning experiences–both formal and informal. Assessment of student work will include participation in class discussions and musical experiences, a report on music education practices in a chosen cultural context, reflective journals on a multi-week music teaching or learning practice, and a demonstration lesson that uses music in some way. All musical interests and levels of musicianship (including novices) are welcome in this course.Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: None. Class limit: 12.

"McKown, Jamie",The Cold War: Early Years,HS HY,Intermediate,"This course provides a broad historical overview of the early years of the “Cold War” period that shaped global politics generally and American foreign policy specifically. Beginning in the 1940’s and leading up to Richard Nixon's election in 1968 we will examine the diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and how this relationship has impacted state actors, economic policies, cultural production, and conceptions of identity. While there will be a heavy focus on traditional state-level diplomatic history, students will also explore a broad array of methodological approaches. Class sessions will include a mix of traditional lecture formats, class discussion, and outside presentations. An evening lab is scheduled in order to screen a variety of cultural artifacts from the various periods we will cover. The primary goal is to give students an intensive 10-week crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.. that defined the early decades of Cold War diplomacy. At the same time there is also time allocated for students to explore their own independent research interests. Given the far-reaching force of Cold War politics into everyday life, individuals with widely varying academic interests will find the course informative and productive.

"Khor, Su Yin","The Craft, Theory, and Practice of Interviewing ",HS,Advanced,"This course is about the craft, theory, and practice of interviewing primarily for research projects, but it’s also relevant to other interview-based projects like documentaries, journalism, and podcasts. Craft: Asking questions is a fundamental component of human interactions, but interviewing requires more than basic interactional ability. It takes thought, intention, empathy, and presence to build a relationship with interviewees and to create a space where they feel safe, seen, and heard. How do interviewers orient to the speakers and navigate power dynamics while humanizing the interview process? Theory: You will be introduced to the ways that interviews and the interviewer-interviewee relationship have been theorized and conceptualized by researchers. Recent efforts to humanize research methods have raised questions about the use of interviews, as well as the positioning and treatment of interviewees. What ethical considerations do we have to make when people trust us with their stories? Practice: A great deal of preparation is completed prior to interviewing and more labor awaits post-interview. You will learn about practical aspects, such as question design, recording methods, transcription practices, and analytical methods (discourse analysis). Basic aspects of developing a research/project will be introduced and ethical considerations will be discussed. As risks can’t be eliminated, how do we navigate, assess, and manage them? Skills like project development and an understanding of ethics, informed consent, and risk assessment are transferable to projects such as documentaries, journalism, podcasts, and many more. The course provides an overview of Ethical Research Review Board (ERRB) processes and human subjects research. Submitting an ERRB proposal isn’t required, but the proposal development skills are important to other genres, such as senior project proposals, fellowship applications, grant proposals, and graduate school applications. This course draws primarily on scholarship in the social sciences, specifically applied linguistics, discourse studies, and linguistic anthropology. You will develop an interview-focused project to explore a topic of your choice and present your findings in an appropriate genre, such as a research paper, journalistic piece, podcast or other genre. Evaluation is based on discussions, written assignments, labs, individual and group work, peer-reviews, data sessions, and interview and transcription practice. The readings are interview-focused and address many areas, including but not limited to food, identity, language, discourse, gender, race, and class. You must have completed your writing requirement and completed at least three terms at COA (or one academic year elsewhere) to enroll in this course.Level: Advanced. Prerequisite: Must have taken a writing course and completed at least 3 terms at COA or one academic year at a different institution. Methods classes are not easy and require students to juggle a lot of work, readings, and deadlines. This course is probably more suitable for students in their third or fourth year. Class limit: 12.

"Ferrari , Melissa ",Visualizing Truth: Animated Documentary,ADS,Introductory/Intermediate,"For over a century, filmmakers have used animation to imagine realities that can’t be captured on live-action film. From the stop motion scientific visualization of stag beetles in Wladyslaw Starewicz’s ""Lucanus Cervus"" (1910) to Winsor McCay’s dramatic hand-drawn re-enactment of ""The Sinking of the Lusitania"" (1918), early animated documentary was both embraced for its ability to visualize the unseeable and wielded as a powerful tool for propaganda. In recent decades, animation has grown increasingly popular as a mode of nonfiction filmmaking, celebrated for its ability to poetically moderate complex truths with raw emotionality; process identity, trauma and memory; and explore collective histories.In this course, students will make a series of short nonfiction animation projects. Techniques might include comics, journalism, rotoscoping, scientific visualization, observational palimpsest, and archival stop motion. Discussion topics will cover the ethics of representation and appropriation, research methodologies, photographic indexicality, embodying empathy through anonymity, and navigating the truth of constructed images in a post-truth media landscape. Readings and screenings of historical and contemporary animated documentaries will introduce students to the field, including films by Penny Lane, Jonas Poher Rasmussen, Mona Chalabi, Ng’endo Mukaii, Alisi Telengut, Kyungwon Song, Sheila Sofian, Danski Tang, and Adam & Zack Khalil. Students do not need animation experience to enroll in the class—supplementary technical workshops will provide students with instruction in the necessary software and tools, including Dragonframe and Adobe Premiere. Students will be evaluated on their successful and timely completion of assignments, critical engagement with reading/screening materials, and thoughtful participation in class discussions.Level: Introductory/Intermediate.

"Donovan, Martha","Writing as Art, Craft, and Social Action",W HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"We write to discover what awes us, what questions we most need to ask, what conversations we hope to join, what causes we are drawn to support, what convictions we want to voice, and what ways we can write the world anew. Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action.
