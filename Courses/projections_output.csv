HS1091,S26,"Gagnon, Pam",Introduction to Feminist Therapy,I,"Feminist Therapy is focused on empowerment through self-awareness and self-assertion as shaped by an understanding of the larger social and political constructs that influence our thoughts and behaviors. In practice the application of feminist therapy synthesizes tenets of gender-based psychology, psychosocial theories of lifespan development, multicultural analysis, and applied social change activism with the objective of self evolution in relation to personal, social, political, and cultural exchanges.This course offers an overview of the origins and applications of feminist therapy as a conceptual framework developed in response to androcentric therapies. We will begin by acknowledging the forerunners of feminist therapy such as Karen Horney and Leta Stetter Hollingworth. We will continue studying the contributions of contemporary feminist therapists such as Ellyn Kaschak, Lenore E. Walker, Jean Baker Miller, and Laura Brown, including prominent contributions by women of color in clinical psychology such as the work of Ruth Winifred Howard and Ellen Kitch Childs, and those who are currently pioneering the development of women’s psychology in other countries such as Vindhya Undurti. We will explore the core principles of feminist therapy, and the influences and implications of power and gender biases at play in clinical practice throughout assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Students will have the opportunity to learn about feminist therapeutic techniques.The objective of the course is to aid students in developing a functional knowledge of feminist therapy and its various clinical applications. Students who have a desire to pursue psychotherapy and social work are encouraged to consider this course as a means of understanding the benefit of feminist therapy in the development of egalitarian therapeutic relationships.The class format includes lectures, roleplays, media presentations, interviews with guest speakers, group work, and discussions. Opportunities will be provided for students to reflect upon experiences, to practice skills, and apply learning through a community project.Students will be evaluated on their critical thinking, analysis, and synthesis of the course goals and objectives as demonstrated by participation in class activities, responsiveness to required and suggested readings as evidenced by successful completion of course assignments and active participation in lecture generated discussion.Level: Introductory.

ES2054,S26,"Slabach, Brittany",Curatorial Practice: Study Skins,I/M,"This course provides a deep dive into the practice and art of preparing museum study skins. Study skins are a traditional form of specimen preparation that preserves the skin and feathers of organisms for research purposes. Preparation techniques vary by taxon and research objective. In this course we will read about the history of study skins, how preparation techniques have evolved over time, and the role of study skins in our understanding of our natural world. A foundational component of the course is to learn how to prepare study skins. Therefore, we will establish a practice of preparing study skins weekly. Through this practice students will learn different techniques of preparation, as well as gain a strong foundation in anatomy related to different organisms and learn how to use appropriate anatomical language. The course meeting time is structured to support this weekly practice. While we will discuss preparation techniques for different taxons, iterative practice of techniques will depend on availability of organismal specimens and will be biased towards vertebrates, particularly mammals and aves. Assessments will include a reflection journal documenting each student’s preparatory journey; discussion and activity participation; and the completion of a series of study skins demonstrating improvement in technique over the course of the term. This course builds on concepts discussed in Collecting Nature, and other organismal courses. The course is particularly suitable for students who would like to pursue careers in organismal ecology, taxonomy, or museum studies, and would like study skin preparation to be a part of their skillset. It would also serve students who are interested in gaining an in-depth knowledge of organismal anatomy, or those who are interested in different preparation techniques.Level: Introductory/Intermediate.

ES4069,S26,"Gadeken, Kara",Experimental Marine Science Methods,M/A,"Contemporary marine science research relies on a rapidly developing world of aquatic technologies, yet there has also been a recent revolution in low-cost, DIY electronics and components. For experimentalists, there is immense value in having a broad knowledge of the assorted tools in your methodological “toolkit”. Often, the instrument to collect the data you need doesn’t exist or is unaffordable, in which case the best option may be to build it yourself. Learning how to operate, fix, or even construct instruments to answer a research question builds a strong and interconnected foundation of scientific skills, both concrete (programming, simple electronics, instrumentation, machining, and engineering) and cognitive (critical thinking, creative problem solving, cost-benefit analysis, forethought, resilience, and the “methods” part of the scientific method).In this course you will (1) practice the practical and cognitive skills that experimental marine scientists use to do research, and (2) learn how to design and construct custom aquatic instrumentation to answer a scientific question. The course will start with you constructing a simple aquatic sensor to build basic skills, move on to creating a lab setup designed to manipulate some aspect of the aquatic environment, and end with self-directed research projects devising and building an instrument to explore your own scientific question. Much of our class time will be spent in a collaborative learning setting similar to a research group. Throughout the course, we will explore the ways that creative custom instrumentation can push the boundaries of science and make high-quality research more accessible.This is a project-based course that is intended for STEM-motivated students. It would serve particularly well to bridge students into pursuing more advanced scientific research endeavors.This class is very much a group effort, and assessment will be based on active participation in class experiences as well as written assignments in the style of a technical report, short weekly reflections, and a presentation at an end-of-term symposium. In addition to class meetings, expect to spend a substantive amount of time outside of class working on your projects.Level: Intermediate/Advanced.

ES3076,S26,"Letcher, Susan",Restoration Ecology,M,"The Society for Ecological Restoration defines ecological restoration as “the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.” In this era of widespread environmental degradation, restoration ecology provides an important set of methods for mitigating anthropogenic damage. However, the science of restoration is still in its early phases, and important theoretical and practical questions remain to be resolved. This class will critically examine the assumptions that underlie restoration planning, both in the ethical dimension and in the realm of scientific theory. We will consider the validity of conceptual models of ecological communities and ecosystems and the way that these models shape decision-making. We will survey the factors that must be taken into account during restoration and study best-practices approaches, with a focus on adaptive management. In the final project, groups of students will develop and present restoration plans for a local site. Students will be evaluated based on two essays, class participation, and the final project.Level: Intermediate.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness.

Using John Gillis’s innovative work in The Human Shore as a foundation, this course will explore the work of a wide range of scholars across many disciplines, such as history, geology, literature, indigenous studies, art, and marine science, etc., to examine the differences between a coast and a human shore. We will cover topics as diverse as the indigenous lives along the coasts over time, the geologic formation of coastlines, and the portrayal of coasts in Shakespeare. Thus, the course will interrogate the human experience of these spaces from a range of disciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives. Visitors from the blue humanities and other areas will enrich the class with their work and perspectives, helping students think through both their work and how they do it.

HS1130,S26,"Taneja, Palak",College Seminar: Women in True Crime,I,"Commercialized in the 16th century through ballads and pamphlets, true crime has been around for a bit. Yet it is in the recent decade or so, with the proliferation of streaming services, social media, and the popularity of podcasts as a genre, that we see a rising interest among women both in the production and consumption of true crime. Statistics vary depending on the source, but the general consensus is that somewhere between 65-80% of the audience for true crime is women. What then is the root of this fascination? What role does gender play in it? And how do we wrap our minds around this phenomenon and the elements—violence, sensationalism, exploitation of victims—that come along with it? These are but some of the questions that we will delve into in this class.Using a genre-based approach, we will study and analyze women-centric true crime books, case files, articles, blogs, podcasts, and documentaries. Our focus will not only be on the content of these works, but also on the forces that shape the writing/composing process: that is, the purpose (awareness, entertainment, reporting, etc.), the intended audience (detectives, true crime enthusiasts, academics, etc.), and the like. For example, when we read I’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and watch the show by the same name, we will devote time to understanding and writing about the stylistic choices that might be particular to a genre, here a non-fiction book and documentary, respectively. Some other examples of works that we would look at are Crime Junkie by Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, and Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer by Liz Garbus. The study of the form and peculiarities of these genres, along with the textbook, Understanding Rhetoric, will help us develop both the vocabulary and the skills to understand and work on our own writing process. This process will be honed further through writing assignments in various genres—in-class freewrites, newspaper reports, crime blogs, reading responses, paper, portfolio reflection letter, and a multimodal project—and a sustained practice of the art of peer-reviewing and revision. In short, you will critically read, think, and write about women in true crime with the end goal of developing skills that will serve you well outside the limits of our theme.Assessment will be based on writing assignments in various genres– in-class freewrites, newspaper reports, crime blogs, reading responses, paper, portfolio reflection letter, and a multimodal project–and a sustained practice of the art of peer-reviewing and revision.

HS1129,S26,"Nguyen, Hien",Introduction to Political Economy,I,"This course introduces students to the study of political economy from a Marxist perspective. Unlike economics which focuses on various parts of the economy, whether at the micro- or macro- level, political economy focuses on the intertwining of power and money, or how politics affects the economic system and how the economy in turn shapes politics. As most of the world now lives with variants of the capitalist economic system, we will devote our time to study the structure of capitalism, its logics, as well as its contradictions and malfunctions. We will do so by engaging with Karl Marx’s original writings, which to this day still constitute one of the most fundamental and insightful critiques of the capitalist economic system. Marx’s Capital, Volume One will be both our guiding posts and a useful entry point for thinking about a wide range of issues, including labor and value, commodity fetishism and consumerism, capital accumulation and exploitation, and the ongoing violence of accumulation through dispossession, colonization, and other means.As Eric Wolf, the late anthropologist, has noted, “the social sciences constitute one long dialogue with the ghost of Marx” (Europe and the People without History, 1982). Rather than being Marx’s disciples, we strive to be his interlocutor. As such, in addition to selections from Marx’s key works, we also read current Marxian political economy scholarship that draws on, critiques, and pushes its boundaries This course is valuable for any students who are interested in politics, economics, international development, future study, food systems, climate justice, social changes, and any area of studies that grapple with capitalism in its transnational, racialized, and gendered dimensions. Upon completion, students will have developed practices of thinking critically and imaginatively about capitalism’s fundamental drives, uneven development, appetite for technological innovation, and tendency towards violent expansion. No previous knowledge is required, but students should be prepared to read complex, abstract texts. Students will be evaluated through bi-weekly reading reviews (approximately 3-5 pages of critical reflection based on assigned readings) and a final project.Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None.

HS5064,S26,"McKown, Jamie",Voting and Elections: Case Studies,A,"This course will be an in depth exploration of contemporary flashpoint issues involving the design, administration, and regulation of elections for public office in the United States. We will take up a series of case studies by examining their history, the stakeholders involved, and the pros and cons of the relevant alternative reform measures that have been proposed. Topics covered in a given term will vary based on changing external factors such as the timing of elections as well as student interests. Students enrolling in the class should expect to be contacted by the instructor prior to the start of the term to discuss areas of interest. Likely areas that may be covered include: campaign finance reform, gerrymandering, instant runoff voting, election technologies, voter suppression, alternative governmental models, the electoral college, party primaries, campaign communication regulation, government funding of elections, nationalization of election standards, etc.. This advanced seminar will emphasize collaborative work, discussion, and debate. We will ground our work as a group in tangible solutions that address existing problems in how elections are conducted in the United States.

HS3032,S26,"McKown, Jamie",The Cold War: Early Years,M,"This course provides a broad historical overview of the early years of the “Cold War” period that shaped global politics generally and American foreign policy specifically. Beginning in the 1940’s and leading up to Richard Nixon's election in 1968 we will examine the diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and how this relationship has impacted state actors, economic policies, cultural production, and conceptions of identity. While there will be a heavy focus on traditional state-level diplomatic history, students will also explore a broad array of methodological approaches. Class sessions will include a mix of traditional lecture formats, class discussion, and outside presentations. An evening lab is scheduled in order to screen a variety of cultural artifacts from the various periods we will cover. The primary goal is to give students an intensive 10-week crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.. that defined the early decades of Cold War diplomacy. At the same time there is also time allocated for students to explore their own independent research interests. Given the far-reaching force of Cold War politics into everyday life, individuals with widely varying academic interests will find the course informative and productive. Evaluation will be based on a mix of class participation, individual research assignments, and exams. All students, regardless of their backgrounds, previous coursework, or interests are welcome.

HS2020,S26,"Longsworth, Gordon",GIS I: Foundations & Applications,I/M,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Pre-requisites: Basic computer literacy.

Using John Gillis’s innovative work in The Human Shore as a foundation, this course will explore the work of a wide range of scholars across many disciplines, such as history, geology, literature, indigenous studies, art, and marine science, etc., to examine the differences between a coast and a human shore. We will cover topics as diverse as the indigenous lives along the coasts over time, the geologic formation of coastlines, and the portrayal of coasts in Shakespeare. Thus, the course will interrogate the human experience of these spaces from a range of disciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives. Visitors from the blue humanities and other areas will enrich the class with their work and perspectives, helping students think through both their work and how they do it. This course is appropriate for students interested in applying their interdisciplinary learning in a thematically framed, place-based way. They will hone their skills at examining how specific threads of scholarship contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how people live on and think about coasts and shores.

This course introduces students to the foundations of Buddhist philosophy and practice. Buddhism encompasses a variety of different traditions, teachings, practices, and goals. In this class, we will adopt a philosophical perspective to explore a range of Buddhist thinking on topics such as reality, consciousness, nothingness, and ethical conduct. We will begin by reading Asvagho?a's Buddhacarita, which tells the story of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha. Next, we will study the Theravada, Buddhism's foundational structure, and then proceed to explore the later Mahayana teachings. This course will study primary literature, including excerpts from the Pali Canon and several Mahayana sutras, alongside selections from contemporary thinkers such as Thích Nhat Hanh, angel Kyodo williams, and Pema Chödrön. Along the way, we will discuss suffering (dukkha), emptiness (suññata), impermanence (anicca), non-self (anatta), interdependence or dependent uprising (pa?iccasamuppada), desire (tanha), the four noble truths, the eightfold path, liberation and enlightenment (nibbana), action and causation (kamma), wisdom (pañña), compassion (karuna and bodhicitta), and our responsibilities to other beings. Although this course primarily focuses on Buddhist theory and Buddhist texts, students will be briefly introduced to different meditation and mindfulness practices through a series of guest speakers and a weekend visit to the Morgan Bay Zendo in Surry, Maine.

HS5072,S26,"Khor, Su Yin","The Craft, Theory, and Practice of Interviewing",A,"This course is about the craft, theory, and practice of interviewing primarily for research projects, but it’s also relevant to other interview-based projects like documentaries, journalism, and podcasts. Craft: Asking questions is a fundamental component of human interactions, but interviewing requires more than basic interactional ability. It takes thought, intention, empathy, and presence to build a relationship with interviewees and to create a space where they feel safe, seen, and heard. How do interviewers orient to the speakers and navigate power dynamics while humanizing the interview process? Theory: You will be introduced to the ways that interviews and the interviewer-interviewee relationship have been theorized and conceptualized by researchers. Recent efforts to humanize research methods have raised questions about the use of interviews, as well as the positioning and treatment of interviewees. What ethical considerations do we have to make when people trust us with their stories? Practice: A great deal of preparation is completed prior to interviewing and more labor awaits post-interview. You will learn about practical aspects, such as question design, recording methods, transcription practices, and analytical methods (discourse analysis). Basic aspects of developing a research/project will be introduced and ethical considerations will be discussed. As risks can’t be eliminated, how do we navigate, assess, and manage them? Skills like project development and an understanding of ethics, informed consent, and risk assessment are transferable to projects such as documentaries, journalism, podcasts, and many more. The course provides an overview of Ethical Research Review Board (ERRB) processes and human subjects research. Submitting an ERRB proposal isn’t required, but the proposal development skills are important to other genres, such as senior project proposals, fellowship applications, grant proposals, and graduate school applications. This course draws primarily on scholarship in the social sciences, specifically applied linguistics, discourse studies, and linguistic anthropology. You will develop an interview-focused project to explore a topic of your choice and present your findings in an appropriate genre, such as a research paper, journalistic piece, podcast or other genre. Evaluation is based on discussions, written assignments, labs, individual and group work, peer-reviews, data sessions, and interview and transcription practice. The readings are interview-focused and address many areas, including but not limited to food, identity, language, discourse, gender, race, and class. You must have completed your writing requirement and completed at least three terms at COA (or one academic year elsewhere) to enroll in this course.Level: Advanced. Prerequisite: Must have taken a writing course and completed at least 3 terms at COA or one academic year at a different institution.

ES1026,S26,"Feldman, David",Intro to Chaos & Fractals,I,"This course presents an elementary introduction to chaos and fractals. The main focus will be on using discrete dynamical systems to illustrate many of the key phenomena of chaotic dynamics: stable and unstable fixed and periodic points, deterministic chaos, bifurcations, and universality. A central result of this study will be the realization that very simple non-linear equations can exhibit extremely complex behavior. In particular, a simple deterministic system (i.e., physical system governed by simple, exact mathematical rules) can behave in a way that is unpredictable and random, (i.e., chaotic). This result suggests that there are potentially far-reaching limits on the ability of science to predict certain phenomena. Students in this class will also learn about fractals---self-similar geometric objects---including the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets. We will also read about and discuss the development of the field of chaos. In so doing, we will examine the nature of scientific communities, with a particular eye toward how changes in scientific outlooks occur. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to explore the relations between chaos, fractals, and other areas of study such as literature, art, and cultural studies. Students who successfully complete this class should gain a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the basic ideas of chaos and fractals, a greater understanding of the cultural practice of science, and improved mathematical skills.

ES2055,S26,"Edwards, Torrie",Object-Oriented Programming: Computer Game Design,I/M,"Object-oriented programming is a design paradigm that encapsulates variables and functions into structures called objects. Understanding what objects are, how to use them, and how to write your own objects, is a foundational programming skill. An application area in which objects naturally occur is game design. The computer gaming industry is a multi billion dollar industry that combines art, sound, and computing into one package. In part, it is thanks to the computer game market that we have seen rapid advances in computer graphics and compute speed. Computer games are event-driven programs; meaning the sequence of operations is not predetermined but is controlled by the user’s mouse clicks or text responses to prompts. In this class students will develop a computer game as a means to learn object-oriented and event-driven programming. Students who successfully complete this course will gain: 1)a grounding in object-oriented design, 2) an introduction to finite state machines and event driven programming, and 3) experience transforming an idea into a working computer game prototype. Students will gain Python coding experience and general skills that leave them better equipped to pursue a wide range of programming tasks. This course is intended for students who have some computer experience and are interested in independently learning new skills. While this course is designed to build on Introduction to Computer Science, adventurous beginners are encouraged to take this class. Students will be evaluated on weekly check-ins and assignments. The main project throughout the class will be to design, develop, and test a computer game prototype which culminates in a final demonstration.

HS1131,S26,"Tsygankova, Valeria",Animals and Arguments,I,"In 1903, American naturalist John Burroughs triggered a fierce public debate when he accused some of his peers of writing “sham natural history.” These other naturalists, Burroughs claimed, had given in to the major temptation lying in wait for all nature writers: “the danger of making too much of what we see and describe—of putting in too much sentiment, too much literature—in short, of valuing these things more for the literary effects we can get out of them than for themselves.” The ensuing debate over the responsible depiction of nonhuman nature went on for five years in the pages of popular magazines, drawing in dozens of writers and one U.S. president. More than a century later, we remember it as the “nature faker” controversy. But though this episode has taken its place in the history books, its unresolved tensions and questions live on, occupying nature writers and filmmakers to this day: How can writers tell stories that spark human interest in the natural world while doing justice to that world’s alterity? What does it mean to value nonhuman animals “for themselves” and not for the reasons we might project onto them? Are emotion and imagination incompatible with good nature writing? In this writing class, students will not only get to know this longstanding conversation; they will also be asked to weigh in. Students will study the strategies that help experienced writers make their own marks on existing debates: strategies for posing rich problems, analyzing texts, representing and responding to other voices, giving and using feedback, and otherwise developing a sustainable writing practice. Students will become better navigators of writing for various contexts and audiences by studying and practicing the ways in which public and scholarly writers convey their ideas to readers. Students will be evaluated on a rhetorical analysis of a single text; an analytical essay that incorporates multiple sources and makes an original argument; a reflection that analyzes their own approach to writing; participation in in-class work; and the completion of short, low-stakes assignments preparing them for class. This course will be helpful for new college students looking to establish a base of knowledge about analytical writing, as well as for students at any point in their college careers who want to dedicate some time to working on their writing.Level: Introductory.

ES4016,S26,"Anderson, John",Island Life,M/A,"Islands have played a major role in the development of ecological and evolutionary theory. Most recently, islands have served as an important metaphor in the development of conservation biology. Maine is blessed with a plethora of islands -between 4500 and 6000 at the last count- and the history and pre-history of these islands is intimately entwined with that of the continent itself. This course examines historical and current interpretations of island biogeography and the interplay between natural and human history and human ecology. The class will be taught as a combination of term-time seminar and in the field, based on the College's field station on Great Duck Island and the College's research vessel. During the Spring term we will be meeting regularly to examine the theoretical basis of Island Biogeography and islands as the subject of scientific and literary discussion since Aristotle. Readings will include Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace, and contemporary authors. In late August we will re-convene for the field component of the class. During the first half of this component, we will be focusing primarily on Great Duck Island and its immediate surroundings, learning and applying theoretical approaches to islands' landscapes, with extensive reading from the primary literature. During the second half of the class, we will move further afield, exploring a variety of islands in eastern Maine, and relating our observations to theoretical predictions. Ultimately we hope to travel to Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy to observe a large island community, see the traditional weir fishery, and observe firsthand migrating right and humpback whales, and northern seabirds.

ED3107,S26,"Buchanan, Rebecca",Culturally Sustaining and Revitalizing Education,M,"This course is designed for students planning to teach in schools whether in Maine or outside of the United States. Culturally sustaining/revitalizing education (CSRE) builds on the aims, values, insights, and practices of anti-racist education, culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, culturally sustaining/revitalizing pedagogy, decolonizing education, global education, intercultural education, and multicultural education. In particular, it aims to contextualize education in the history of colonization, land theft, slavery, the continued struggle for sovereignty and self-determination of native tribes and First Nations, and calls for wider community accountability. This educational approach challenges deficit mindsets and structures that undergird policies and practices that widen the opportunity gap and equitable access to basic human and civil rights and impede educational access for sustaining and revitalizing cultures that settler colonialism has attempted to eliminate, assimilate, or marginalize. Students will practice asset-based and growth mindsets to gain an understanding of the relationship between CSRE and respect for tribal sovereignty and support of contemporary struggles for tribal continuity and resistance to cultural genocide and epistemicide. The course also opens a dialogue on the applicability of CRSE for immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking students whose relationship to their new place of residence may be tenuous at best and whose heritage languages and cultures are also endangered as a result of first- to second-generation assimilation in their adopted communities. Students will gain an understanding of conceptual frameworks, knowledge of empirical studies documenting outcomes and impacts of these approaches, and skills in ethically and effectively teaching indigenous, immigrant, and other culturally and linguistically diverse learners. For students seeking Maine teaching endorsements, this course will prepare them to implement LD291 requiring Maine educators to teach Wabanaki history and culture. Students will learn through field trips, guest speakers, films, discussions, critical exploration and reflection, independent research, observation/fieldwork/practicum, and peer teaching. Evaluation will include artifacts to be incorporated into a teaching portfolio: a lesson plan, teaching video, self-assessment, assessment of PK-12 student work, and communication with families and community members.

MD1038,S26,"Stephenson, Toby",Introduction to Marine Navigation,I,"This is an introductory course that teaches students the principles and primary skills of navigation in coastal waters, utilizing compasses, charts, electronic plotters, radar, and, to some extent, quadrants. This will happen through a combination of theoretical, celestial, loxodromic, and radio navigation,and the practical: charting courses on paper, steering courses on the water, and the construction of traditional navigation instruments that help to cement the value of using angles for reading positions relative to celestial objects. The first half of the course will be devoted to early history and the theoretical, and practical, art of navigation; the second half of the course will focus on constructing instruments, such as cross-staffs and backstaffs, and participating in fieldwork aboard the college’s MV Osprey, putting skills to practice. We will explore, to a limited degree, modern methods of navigation by using radar and GPS, and we will visit the Maine Maritime Academy simulator for a virtual experience piloting a large ship in congested waters. The main focus will be to cement primary navigation skills and knowledge so that students are comfortable conducting small vessel navigation on local waters by the end of the course. This course is open to all students interested in navigation and is particularly suited for those considering maritime careers. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to: understand the fundamental principles of navigation; plot courses of travel, fix a position and perform dead reckoning calculations; appreciate the role of celestial movements and magnetic variations that influence navigation; and use hand tools to craft instruments used in early navigation.

ED2013,S26,"McLean, Adam",Teaching and Learning Music in Human Ecology,I/M,"Music has been a powerful component of human ecology since time immemorial. It can carry our stories, express our values, communicate aspects of our individual and communal identities, and help us understand those of others. Consequently, the ways that music has been transmitted across generations have had profound impacts on the course of humanity. Understanding how and why music is taught and learned is, therefore, crucial to understanding human ecology. Using transdisciplinary resources from social studies, musicology, education studies, neuroscience, and more, this course will explore how people learn music, what people learn through music, and how musical teaching practices can reflect and shape the cultural identities of individual learners and their communities. In addition to taking part in seminars centered around multimedia course materials, students in this course will observe and engage in music teaching and learning experiences–both formal and informal. Assessment of student work will include participation in class discussions and musical experiences, a report on music education practices in a chosen cultural context, reflective journals on a multi-week music teaching or learning practice, and a demonstration lesson that uses music in some way.

The study will investigate a wide variety of dance scholarship, including text and film resources, through discussion, embodied learning, and physical expression. Students will consider the work of artists and dance scholars that explicitly engage questions of queer liberation and solidarity. Students will also examine dance’s unique role in expanding and subverting normalized expressions of gender and sexuality in American culture since the early 1900s, with specific attention paid to the work of dance artists within movements for civil rights and social justice.We will touch on significant moments in American dance history including the incorporation of Afro-Caribbean diasporic dance and other forms, toward the evolution of what is now referred to as American modern dance. We will also explore a selection of histories from drag, cabaret, and the emergence of distinctively Queer dance forms throughout the 20th century including forms that came out of the Ballroom scene; Vogue, Tut, Waacking etc. There will be a strong emphasis on dance artist-activist contributions during the early years of the AIDS crisis. Students will be expected to view footage both inside and outside of class, complete weekly readings, short informal writings, and shared dance projects. A consistent movement practice will place our learning in an embodied dialogue with the artists, forms, and texts studied.

HS4119,S26,"Sullivan, Leeann","Mutal aid, Past, and Future",M/A,"Contemporary political theory often explores how our established institutions drive seemingly intractable forms of ecological degradation and social harms. These critiques can offer potent models for pathologizing the injustices around us, but—by their magnitude—are also exhausting, making it difficult to imagine alternative ways of living together. As climate change disrupts our food systems, as pathogenic diseases spread and mutate, as social conflict grows, how can we possibly dream of more just and sustainable futures when we are regularly consumed with what it takes just to survive?In this highly interactive course, we will explore one possible answer to this question by considering whether mutual aid—both as an idea and as a really-existing practice—offers any useful speculative and technical tools for responding to our emerging “polycrisis”. We will first theorize mutual aid through a biological lens as a tactic of survival among species, and situate this theory in historical and social context. We will then explore mutual aid as an emergent practice that is always already occurring around us, and conclude by discussing the potentialities it opens (and those that it doesn't) for imaging alternative futures within, without, and around our existing institutions. Students in this course will be expected to read and reflect on high-level theoretical texts, participate actively in classroom discussion, and engage in community and campus-level projects that mirror our classroom discussions.

This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of. Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly. This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for public communication. Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits. The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other. This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches. Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation. All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course. This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches. Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None.

ES1098,S26,"Edwards, Torrie",Introduction to CS: image and sound,I,"Did you know, computers can be used to build and modify images and sound bytes? In this course, students with little to no prior computer experience will learn the foundations of computer science through projects focused on visual media and sound. This work will culminate in a final project consisting of an interactive display or exhibit. It will be helpful if you are interested in art and sound, but no prior experience is necessary. Students who successfully complete this course will have learned: 1)How to read a simple program and correctly describe the outcome, 2)How to take a problem statement and convert it into code, and 3)How basic computer memory works. In addition, students will gain new ways for conceptualizing and working with image and sound that they will be able to draw on in their creative and scholarly practice. While this is an introductory course, it is important to note that learning to program is like learning a new language. There is a time commitment to learning new syntax and understanding the language of computing. This course is taught in Python, and students will be evaluated on weekly check-ins and projects. This course, or the equivalent, is required for many further courses in computer science and related areas. Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None. Class limit: 15. Lab fee: None.

What are the possibilities and limitations of responding to or representing a place through sound recording and playback? How do contemporary composers and sound artists engage place-specific material in their work? This practice-based course examines the interdisciplinary field of sound studies through close reading, listening, and hands-on (ears-on?) work in sound. Students will create place-based recording projects and site-specific sound installations that draw on local fieldwork excursions around Frenchman Bay, as well as on archival research connected to the Maine Sound and Story Archive and others. Students will sharpen skills in field recording, audio editing, multi-channel sound mixing and presentation, artistic collaboration, and building sonic-rich soundscapes as they work to create immersive sound art projects. This class will work to expand the narrative podcast format, seeking more abstract and layered forms that draw on research and storytelling to help audiences sense a place or a concept through the experience of sound. The course will examine key readings in the field of sound studies, and investigate the practice of sound artists working at the intersections of sound and climate change, sound and social (in)justice, the repatriation of sound recordings, sound and ethnographic practice, and more.

How might biomimicry offer us tactics for surprising or outsmarting ourselves? What could it mean to make an artwork in an “erosive” or “sedimentary” way? What creative possibilities can follow an unforeseen or catastrophic change? This sculpture course takes its cues from the many processes occurring spontaneously in the natural world: growth, decay, metamorphosis, erosion, accretion, collapse, drift, and more. We will work in tandem with natural processes as both practical and conceptual methodologies. A series of individual and collaborative projects will prompt experiments in eco-sculptural production which engage our own lived experiences of the natural world with criticality and emotion. Expect to encounter familiar materials (wood, textiles, clay) as well as some that may be new (plant matter, paper pulp, recycled and discarded objects, etc).

AD2051,S26,"Ferrari, Melissa",Visualizing Truth: Animated Documentary,I/M,"For over a century, filmmakers have used animation to imagine realities that can’t be captured on live-action film. From the stop motion scientific visualization of stag beetles in Wladyslaw Starewicz’s ""Lucanus Cervus"" (1910) to Winsor McCay’s dramatic hand-drawn re-enactment of ""The Sinking of the Lusitania"" (1918), early animated documentary was both embraced for its ability to visualize the unseeable and wielded as a powerful tool for propaganda. In recent decades, animation has grown increasingly popular as a mode of nonfiction filmmaking, celebrated for its ability to poetically moderate complex truths with raw emotionality; process identity, trauma and memory; and explore collective histories.In this course, students will make a series of short nonfiction animation projects. Techniques might include comics, journalism, rotoscoping, scientific visualization, observational palimpsest, and archival stop motion. Discussion topics will cover the ethics of representation and appropriation, research methodologies, photographic indexicality, embodying empathy through anonymity, and navigating the truth of constructed images in a post-truth media landscape. Readings and screenings of historical and contemporary animated documentaries will introduce students to the field, including films by Penny Lane, Jonas Poher Rasmussen, Mona Chalabi, Ng’endo Mukaii, Alisi Telengut, Kyungwon Song, Sheila Sofian, Danski Tang, and Adam & Zack Khalil. Students do not need animation experience to enroll in the class—supplementary technical workshops will provide students with instruction in the necessary software and tools, including Dragonframe and Adobe Premiere.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques.

AD4019,S26,"Clinger, Catherine",Studio Printmaking,M/A,"Printmaking is the process of transferring an image from one surface to another. A print mirrors the surface whence it came and also performs as a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking. Students will acquire basic skills as printmakers with an emphasis on relief (woodcut and linocut) and intaglio (line etching, engraving and aquatint) techniques. They will also develop a broad understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper.

But from the dawn of cinema there have been those working on the edges to realize visions that speak to many modes of otherness and to different manners of being, of belonging. In this class we will investigate a range of diverse moving image works and engage with texts that help contextualize and elucidate the works and the creative impulses/individuals behind them. The roster of movies viewed this term will be chosen collaboratively from a curated list by the group at the beginning of the term so as to most effectively engage with the particular interests of this configuration of students; choices include (but are not limited to) films and videos made by and about members of the following communities: LGBTQ+, neurodiversity, seniors, economically disadvantaged, homeless, people with disabilities, people of faith, Inuit, Roma, Sami, Maya, Palawan, Amhara, African diaspora, Indigenous peoples of the US and Australia.

AD1072,S26,"Soares, Zach",Audio Production as Compositional Tools,I,"In 1979, the music producer Brian Eno argued that the recording studio is a “compositional tool,” upending the idea that the recording studio exists to document pre-existing musical compositions. His assertion came on the back of pivotal albums such as The Beatles’ “Revolver” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966), which demonstrated the creative possibilities of composing in the studio. We might call this type of approach to music composition “playing the studio.” In this course, students learn how music production makes use of editing, mixing, and effect processing to maximize its impact. Through readings, film screenings, and audio listening sessions, students learn about past and present studio techniques and use these techniques during audio projects and exercises. Students learn to use virtual instruments, effect processors, microphones, and COA’s recording studio to strengthen their technical audio recording, editing, and mixing skills.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action.

Students will walk the path from St. Jean Pied-du-Port to Santiago de Compostela that millions have traveled since the end of the 9th century. Designated as the first Cultural Route of the Council of Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the route starts in France, crossing the Pyrenees and traveling through the vineyards, plains of wheat and sunflower, verdant hills, medieval villages, and storied cities of northern Spain. While founded as a Catholic pilgrimage, people walking the route today may be embarking on a personal challenge, wrestling with existential questions and life transitions, searching for an intentional community with more caring societal norms or journeying for a myriad of other reasons. Intertwined with the Camino’s religious, cultural, and personal significance is its role as an economic engine across the millennia. The Roman roads and forts are testament to its long standing economic significance. From the age of the Knights Templar through today, the Camino continues to be the economic lifeblood of the region and the small businesses, inns and villages along the route. The course has three primary components. First, students will investigate the human ecology of the Camino through modern and ancient readings, film screenings, visits to sites of historical and cultural significance, and interactions with pilgrims. These materials and interactions will inform group discussions, as well as papers, presentations and other deliverables. Second, to move students beyond their quotidian routine, participants will follow a guided plan of self-discovery, introspection, and reflection that will take place on and around their daily walks. These activities include a series of exercises, one-on-one meetings, and journaling. Finally, to dive deeper into their own Camino, students will conduct a capstone research project of their own design. Proposals, finalized early in the course, shall include the most appropriate means of communicating their findings, such as a research paper, in-depth presentation, or other modality. Whether students are interested in history, geography, commerce, sustainable tourism, art, human relations, spirituality, local foodways, or what it means to be human, this journey will provide ample fodder for a curious mind. Evaluation will be based on engagement with the course, participation in group discussions and meetings, quality of the various written and verbal assignments, and the capstone research project. There are no prerequisites or language requirements. However, some knowledge of Spanish is encouraged and can provide for a more enriching experience. Students must be capable of walking with a 20+ pound backpack over a variety of terrain for an average of 12.4 miles (20 km) per day.

Waste is both a verb and a noun, and the term often carries moral or ethical undertones; time should not be wasted, neither should food nor material goods, and of course, life itself should not be wasted. Waste should be reduced or transformed through consumption or recycling. Waste can occasion disgust and outrage, but even if less acknowledged, also fascination, desire and pleasure. Time spent idle is often time considered ""wasted."" Waste is also often understood as destructive and as the product of destruction. At the same time, waste can also be a necessary by product of its opposites. Psychoanalysis has drawn attention to feces association with gold and the notion of the gift of waste in the formation of subjectivity. Political economy, postcolonial studies, anthropology and feminist theory have all addressed histories of abjection, notions of excrement, disposable populations, and the ways in which humans have dealt with literal waste and those materials and lives that become understood as waste. In this regard, understandings of waste have been central for notions of value, productivity, desire, cleanliness and filth, inside and outside, and the place of difference. In this course, we will examine some of the varied ways in which waste has been understood - in terms of political economy, political theory, postcolonial studies and feminist theory, addressing waste in terms of identity, the natural environment, value, and the formation of what counts as human. Readings will include texts by Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Georges Bataille, Julia Kristeva, Sigmund Freud, Dominque Laporte, Mary Douglas, Jacques Lacan, Norman O. Brown, Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins, William Rathje and Cullen Murphy, Kathleen Millar, Hannah Arendt, Carl Schmitt, Kevin Bales, Paul Ricoeur, Ranjana Khanna, and Françoise Vergès. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, reading responses, and two short analytical essays.",,HS
HS1115,F26,"Lakey, Heather",Utopia/Dystopia,I,"The practice of social dreaming has a long history in philosophical thinking, stretching back to Tao Yuanming and Plato. What constitutes a perfect or ideal society? Or, if no such place is possible, what makes for a well-functioning society? Likewise, what constitutes a terrible society? What kind of places and spaces do we want to avoid? These are important questions for human ecologists to ask as we seek to improve our relationships with our natural, social, and technological environments. To explore questions of imaginary, ideal, and flawed places, this course studies the concepts of utopia and dystopia across a range of philosophical, political, and literary writings. Although we will focus our attention on theoretical literature, we will read one novel and several short stories.Additional course questions include: What motivates us to envision utopias and dystopias? Does political philosophy require a utopian vision? What do utopias and dystopias tell us about social fears, anxieties, and hopes? Are utopia and dystopia inherently connected? What theoretical questions spring from the utopia/dystopia binary? We will read texts such as, Plato’s Republic, Thomas More’s Utopia, Rokeya Hossain’s Sultana’s Dream, Marx and Engels’ Communist Manifesto, Elizabeth Grosz’s The Time of Architecture; William Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, José Estaban Muñoz’s Cruising Utopia, Sigmund Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents, Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower, Ursula K.

But what do we mean by “nature,” and what distinguishes a natural environment from a social one? Moreover, what kinds of relationships should we cultivate with our natural environments? This discussion-based course explores the concepts of nature and environmental responsibility across different philosophical and cultural frameworks. We will draw on a variety of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism, deep ecology, American transcendentalism, indigenous studies, queer theory, and Buddhism. We will read selections from thinkers such as John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, Arne Naess, Val Plumwood, Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau, Eduardo Kohn, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Thich Nhat Hanh, Anna Tsing, and others. Guiding questions include the following: What is nature? How is the idea of nature politicized and socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations to nature? How should humans relate to nature? What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction between humans and nature? Although this course will focus primarily on theoretical questions, we will also discuss issues in applied ethics such as, control over natural resources, wilderness preservation, sustainability, and consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit questions pertaining to environmental activism, and we will consider how philosophy can help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities and obligations. Upon completion of this course, students will have gained a richer philosophical understanding of the idea of nature and they will be familiar with key debates in environmental ethics. Course requirements include weekly writing assignments, a midterm exam, a final paper, and class participation. There are no prerequisites, but students should arrive to this class prepared to engage difficult philosophical texts and to share their ideas with others. Level: Introductory/Intermediate.

Recent methodological and conceptual work as well as growing interest in the history of these topics driven by conservation and policy issues has made this an important and innovative field. Using the work of a variety of scholars from different fields the class will explore how historical accounts can be constructed with an emphasis on the types of available sources, the use of evidence, and how each author builds their argument. We will explicitly compare the methods, use of evidence and other aspects of different disciplinary approaches to the topic to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach. This dimension of the class is particularly interesting because of the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of scholarship right now that brings a wide range of research into dialogue. Students will learn about the history of oceans and fishes by looking at how historians and other scholars frame their works and make their arguments. Students will be evaluated on their preparation for discussion, mastery of the material, short written assignments, and a final project made up of a presentation and essay.

HS2020,F26,"Longsworth, Gordon",GIS I: Foundations & Applications,I/M,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Pre-requisites: Basic computer literacy.

HS1102,F26,"McKown, Jamie","Equal Rights, Equal Voices: Articulating Suffrage",I,"This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century woman suffrage activists in the United States. This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott, Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who are generally less well known today. While this is a course rooted in the history of what we might consider early American feminism, it should come as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront issues that continue to have salience today. Many of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity, equality, empowerment, and political allyship that these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant for us to consider in our contemporary context. This is especially true when it comes to the topic of race and the intersectional nature of the discourse around gender equality, both then and now. We will spend time examining how the idea of race was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and inclusionary ways, within these texts. We will also look specifically at the works of early Black feminists in the United States, and the myriad of ways they navigated the challenges of the moment, especially as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of white supremacy within the early woman suffrage movement. Rather than rely primarily on secondary historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials, mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers “in their own words.” In addition, students will also take part in “hands on” recovery projects designed to locate, transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible works from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring and making effective use of various types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in recent years. Class sessions will be organized as a discussed based seminar. Assignments will emphasize critical, reflective, and analytical writing. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short written response papers, two longer form take-home essays, individual presentations, and a final “recovery” project. Students interested in topics related to gender, politics, historical research, and activism are especially encouraged to enroll.

HS1119,F26,"Nguyen, Hien",Introduction to Microeconomics,I,"Economics has a popular reputation as a field of study centered around making money and getting rich. However, for most of its history, economics has been about understanding and changing the way the world works. How do we get our dinner every night? What does it take to transform coffee beans harvested in plantations in Costa Rica to the morning cup of Starbucks across their 38,000 global locations? Why do some individuals amass unfathomable personal wealth while others face daily struggle for material survival? These questions are what economists primarily study. Whether seemingly straightforward or seemingly unfathomable, at their core these issues are about the process of social provisioning. It can be further broken down into the following questions: (i) As a society, how do we determine what to produce and how much? (ii) As a society, how do we distribute what we produce? And (iii) Who benefits from and who are harmed by our production, distribution and consumption? In this course, we will examine these questions from the perspective of individuals and firms, and we will consider the ways an individual’s preference and decisions are shaped by social institutions and how they, in turn, affect other beings, both human and non-human. You will be introduced to topics such as: individual’s decision making under constraints, social coordination dilemmas, firm’s wage-setting and labor discipline, supply-demand and price setting, market’s successes and failures, and the limits of economic growth. This course aims to increase your ability to use abstract, quantitative models to approach complex, real-world problems such as worsening economic inequalities and global climate change. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and politically about public policies and debates. You will also expand your capacity for numerical literacy and quantitative skills such as drawing valid conclusions based on data and communicating your reasoning and results effectively and clearly. The course is especially valuable for students with interests in civic engagement, social justices, political transformation, and sustainable development.

How are they made? Where do you locate yourself within the structures of which you are part? With whom are you in relation? How can we think about the idea of “agency” in conditions made by economic, political, material and social forces beyond our control? What is structural change? This course examines questions about change, resistance to change, choice, power, responsibility, politics and difference through an introduction to structural and post-structural thought. Structuralism and post-structuralism are modes of thinking that posit that the parts of a structure (e.g. of a society, of a text, of an institution) are made through their relations in that structure. This course will draw on structural and post-structural work in anthropology, literature, science and technology studies (STS), in postcolonial, gender and feminist studies, as well as in deconstruction and psychoanalysis, to investigate the significance of structures of kinship, economy, and language, as well as of institutions such as the school, the military, the state and the corporation. Students will be asked to consider the relation between individual and group, material, economic, racialized and gendered conditions of existence, and notions of agency, responsibility, the individual and the human. In addition to seminar discussions of texts and short writing assignments, students will select a structure within which they are located through which to investigate the central questions of the course.

She was a giant of a public intellectual and contemporizing figure in American Literature; her works continue to inspire and transform readers and scholars of all identities although her primary purpose was to write for black people. As Morrison herself said, ""If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it."" In writing she changed the literary landscape of the US. In particular, her poetics illustrate how African-American and especially African-American women authors express depths of meaning and experience absolutely central to any understanding of the complex culture and histories of the US. Another Morrison quote hints at the profundity of her own view of her life's work: ""We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives."" These two quotes provide a framework for the course, which seeks students interested in language and its power, literature and its insights, and the black female experience. Over the course of the term students will read through Morrison’s oeuvre of novels (The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Love, A Mercy, Home, God Help the Child) as well as a number of her key essays and addresses (Playing in the Dark, The Source of Self-Regard), scholarly criticism, and responses to Morrison's 2019 passing. There may be some division of labor with the later novels (after Paradise), but the course is reading intensive.

HS1131,F26,"Tsygankova, Valeria",Animals and Arguments,I,"In 1903, American naturalist John Burroughs triggered a fierce public debate when he accused some of his peers of writing “sham natural history.” These other naturalists, Burroughs claimed, had given in to the major temptation lying in wait for all nature writers: “the danger of making too much of what we see and describe—of putting in too much sentiment, too much literature—in short, of valuing these things more for the literary effects we can get out of them than for themselves.” The ensuing debate over the responsible depiction of nonhuman nature went on for five years in the pages of popular magazines, drawing in dozens of writers and one U.S. president. More than a century later, we remember it as the “nature faker” controversy. But though this episode has taken its place in the history books, its unresolved tensions and questions live on, occupying nature writers and filmmakers to this day: How can writers tell stories that spark human interest in the natural world while doing justice to that world’s alterity? What does it mean to value nonhuman animals “for themselves” and not for the reasons we might project onto them? Are emotion and imagination incompatible with good nature writing? In this writing class, students will not only get to know this longstanding conversation; they will also be asked to weigh in. Students will study the strategies that help experienced writers make their own marks on existing debates: strategies for posing rich problems, analyzing texts, representing and responding to other voices, giving and using feedback, and otherwise developing a sustainable writing practice. Students will become better navigators of writing for various contexts and audiences by studying and practicing the ways in which public and scholarly writers convey their ideas to readers. Students will be evaluated on a rhetorical analysis of a single text; an analytical essay that incorporates multiple sources and makes an original argument; a reflection that analyzes their own approach to writing; participation in in-class work; and the completion of short, low-stakes assignments preparing them for class.

AD2029,F26,"Clinger, Catherine",Contemporary Artist as Research and Activist,I/M,"The student will be introduced to a contemporary stream of visual culture that places nature, ethos, competing ideologies, and our relationship to these within the context of emergent forms of art activism. In response to environmental and social crisis, theory and praxis figure significantly in the work of artists and artist collectives from around the globe whose practice manifests as socially engaged art (SEA) defined by Pablo Helguera; data/information reimagined as by Mona Hatoum and Trevor Paglen; or examinations of reconciliation and mass trauma in the work of Doris Salcedo and Kara Walker. In some cases, artworks engage with nature/culture by their placement in site-specific locations, through new modes of picturing, and/or through the appropriation of hypothetical scientific musings or emerging technologies (e.g., Ed Atkins, fictionalized genetic hybridization and subversion of surveillance tools). Many of the artists we examine make use of new tools designed for industrial purpose, medical, agricultural, or scientific research. Others further participatory dialogues within anti-racist, de-colonizing, and queer-centred discursive practices. This work is inherently transdisciplinary and human ecological in disposition and character. Many of these producer-artists appropriate the role of “researcher” in order to bring attention to ecologies that human beings have disrupted or will disrupt. Doris Salcedo, Tacita Dean, Kara Walker, Mark Dion, Shirin Neshat, Ai Weiwei, Andra Ursuta, Karim Ben Khelifa, Raven Chacon, Frances Alys, Natalie Jeremijenko, Guillermo Galindo, among others, will be considered.

AD4019,F26,"Clinger, Catherine",Studio Printmaking,M/A,"Printmaking is the process of transferring an image from one surface to another. A print mirrors the surface whence it came and also performs as a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking. Students will acquire basic skills as printmakers with an emphasis on relief (woodcut and linocut) and intaglio (line etching, engraving and aquatint) techniques. They will also develop a broad understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper. Students will be evaluated on their projects, participation in critiques, level of engagement with materials, ability to work in a collaborative studio, and final project.

To what degree are we prepared to be challenged or confronted by something new or different? Of approximately 5000 films produced yearly worldwide, fewer than 5% are given a general U.S. theatrical release. Of these 250, fewer than 30 come from outside the Hollywood system. There are wonderful, unique movies being made every day that most of us will never know exist. This is largely due to entrenched ideas of how to play it commercially ""safe,"" but also has a great deal to do with a national isolationism which Hollywood films support and perpetuate. What are filmmakers in other countries focusing their attentions on? What stylistic choices are they making? How does one find out about these other films, let alone see them? In this class we will watch movies made within the last twelve years in Austria, Belgium, Burkina Faso, Canada, China, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and many other countries--films made by directors the rest of the world acknowledges as masters but who are virtually unknown in the U. S. Critical and theoretical essays from a variety of sources will offer detailed readings on the individual films as well as give a clear picture of how Hollywood functions to silence other voices and the ramifications of these practices on world finance and culture. Among topics covered will be: new media, the digital revolution, the changing face of copyright law, how movies can mask cultural assumptions and reinforce stereotypes or reveal new ways of seeing/perceiving.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended. Evaluation will be based on how the specific criteria set for each assignment are met, participation and engagement during critiques, and receptivity to feedback.Level: Introductory.

AD4046,F26,"Sebastian, Neeraj",Drawing Intensive / Developing a Studio Practice,M/A,"In the first part of this course, drawing will be used to experiment, interrogate and expand different aspects of one’s artistic practice. Using a broad range of materials, students are encouraged to work intuitively and take multiple approaches to presenting ideas–especially ideas that may not have been explored previously in their work–and develop them in different ways. Students will create large quantities of drawings based on prompts that will then be discussed with the class. What stands out? What makes a piece surprising or interesting? What revisions can be made to strengthen these moments or motifs? These are kinds of questions that will inform our discussions.Taken together, these drawings will offer a broad range of possibilities that will then be explored for the rest of the term, during which students will develop a body of work. Students will meet weekly as a group to discuss work made or advanced in the previous week and meet individually with the instructor every other week to discuss materials and other aspects of their art practices. The work made over the course of the term should include material investigation (why are you using the materials you’re using and how does it support your thematic interests?) and embody a range of conceptual concerns. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to several artists’ working methods. Students are expected to work independently and have some degree of familiarity with the materials they choose to work with.“Drawing” is used broadly here: students working in any medium are encouraged to take this course (for example, a student interested in three-dimensional work might respond to the prompts with forms made from cardboard or other found materials). This course is designed to kickstart a nascent practice or one that might have become dormant or plateaued as well as give students room to experiment and then build on these experiments. Students enrolling in this class should have some form of previous studio experience. Evaluation will be based on students’ work, participation in class discussions, the ability to offer critical and constructive feedback to one’s peers, and the ability to push oneself beyond one’s comfort zone or perceived limitations—especially when it comes to allowing the work to evolve and change in response to feedback and critique.

AD1072,F26,"Soares, Zach",Audio Production as Compositional Tools,I,"In 1979, the music producer Brian Eno argued that the recording studio is a “compositional tool,” upending the idea that the recording studio exists to document pre-existing musical compositions. His assertion came on the back of pivotal albums such as The Beatles’ “Revolver” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966), which demonstrated the creative possibilities of composing in the studio. We might call this type of approach to music composition “playing the studio.” In this course, students learn how music production makes use of editing, mixing, and effect processing to maximize its impact. Through readings, film screenings, and audio listening sessions, students learn about past and present studio techniques and use these techniques during audio projects and exercises. Students learn to use virtual instruments, effect processors, microphones, and COA’s recording studio to strengthen their technical audio recording, editing, and mixing skills. Students will be evaluated based on their participation in class discussions, their fluency in the use of recording equipment and software, the process they use to approach each assignment, and the completion of assigned projects.

It is unique among ecosystems in that it condenses and concentrates many ecological processes along a strong physiological gradient, and so serves as an ideal environment to observe and investigate fundamental ecological principles.In this course, you will be introduced to the many diverse intertidal ecosystems of coastal Maine, from rocky shorelines to tidal mudflats to salt marshes. Through discussions in class and observations in the field, we will endeavor to answer the questions:What organisms are found in the intertidal, and how are they adapted to life there?How is the distribution of intertidal organisms dictated by living in a transitional environment?How do intertidal organisms interact with each other, and how does this shape the community?We meet twice per week for class time with one afternoon lab period. During lab time we will be going on field trips as much as possible to explore the local intertidal habitats. This course is intended as an accessible introduction to marine community ecology and field work. Assessment is based on weekly question sets, lab assignments, and a short research proposal.This course is a partner course to Ecology: Natural History, meaning we explore the same topics just in different environments.

AD2042,F26,"Muller, Brook",Ecologies of Cities,I/M,"We typically think of cities as centers of political and economic power, social vibrancy (and tension), and cultural richness, diversity and production. This course explores ecological “readings” of cities, landscapes transformed irrevocably due to human activities and the introduction of unprecedented concentrations of “unnatural” substances and significant loss of biological and hydrological integrity. The course also examines processes by which cities have transformed surrounding regional landscapes as both “wells” of resources and “sinks” for waste and the planetary scale environmental impacts of urban growth in the contemporary global economy. Following a succinct historical survey in the first part of the class (with focus on the interrelated forces of industrialization, colonization and explosive urban growth in the nineteenth century), we will look to recent efforts to reimagine cities such that they are more “ecological.” These efforts come in a variety of forms from “city as refugia” (establishing habitat for nonhumans) to “novel ecosystems” (working with new concentrations of contaminants and colonization of non-native biological communities) to cities as settings in which closed-loop, ecologically inspired systems drive processes of development. Of concern related to all of these ecological urbanisms is that conversion of city landscapes from grey to green and blue can lead to ever greater levels of inequality. In the final section of the course, we will speculate as to ways to intervene in cities-as-ecosystems that build on commitments to both social justice and ecological replenishment, bringing into relation the flourishing of humans and nonhumans in urbanized environments. Evaluations will be based on class participation and sustained engagement with the core themes: attendance, demonstration of close readings of texts, contributions to group discussions (including listening), honing of collaborative capabilities, and commitment to an iterative process with the three course projects (the last of which will be worked on in teams) that involve succinct compositions of written narratives and diagrams and other visual representations (multiple graphics workshops will be structured into the class).Level: Introduction/Intermediate.

Sixty percent of Maine homes are heated with heating oil, the highest percentage of any state, and Mainers spend more than a billion dollars on heating oil each year. Improving the efficiency of our homes and buildings is essential for transitioning away from fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions.In this course, students will learn how to safely transition buildings away from fossil fuels. This includes understanding the science of energy and moisture movement through a building, how to monitor carbon monoxide and other harmful combustion gases, and methods to reduce energy loss, while maintaining comfortable levels of humidity and fresh air. Students will gain proficiency measuring air leakage with a blower door, using an infrared camera to assess insulation levels, calculating heat loss, and identifying solutions and best practices to develop a plan of action for homeowners.They will also learn about high efficiency mechanical systems like air source heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and how to assess lighting and appliance electrical usage. Students will learn how to carry out cost calculations for energy savings and research and share information on rebates and incentives available for homeowners. This will be a very hands-on course, with weekly labs to teach energy auditing field skills. This course will include presentations from local energy contractors, and students will participate in energy audits of residential buildings on or off campus. Through these experiences, students will meet and interact with home performance businesses and non-profit organizations in the local community. As time and weather conditions permit, students will gain experience implementing efficiency solutions such as insulation and air sealing.Students who successfully complete this course will be able to conduct energy audits for homes, identify cost-effective improvements, and prioritize energy improvements to maximize energy savings.

This class will examine the origins of the idea of race and the ways it is central to the creation of the modern world. Drawing on histories of Europe and the Americas this class will look at the different ways racialized thinking was deployed in colonial contexts. Central themes of the course will be the history of race as an idea, the nature and impact of the Atlantic slave trade, how indigenous peoples reshaped European ideas of what it meant to be human, the construction of whiteness, and the history of slavery in the new world. The period covered by the class spans from the origins of race as an idea to the late nineteenth century. The course will be a hybrid of a lecture course and a readings seminar. Students will read major works in the field and develop an understanding of the historical background of contemporary forms of structural inequality justified and reinforced by racialized thinking.

Contemporary bioethics is an expansive and fundamentally interdisciplinary field, but this course will consider key dilemmas in bioethics from a philosophical perspective. More specifically, we will explore how bioethical issues complicate our concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, life and death, and the human and the natural. We will begin with a quick overview of prominent ethical theories and we will consider the possibility of transcultural bioethics. Secondly, we will address the ethical and philosophical questions raised by the following topics: abortion, birth, population, reproduction, cloning, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, resource allocation and organ donation, human research ethics, genetic engineering, the doctor-patient relationship, and medical decision making. Throughout the duration of the term, we will consider how different ethical frameworks shape our assessment of contemporary moral dilemmas.This course will introduce students to the principles of ethical thinking, familiarize students with pressing debates in bioethics, and compel students to discuss issues that are politically and socially contentious.

Both the US and Italy claim pizza as a national dish, and this type of debate about where food comes from—and who it belongs to—is highly connected to our national and local identities. As humans continue to migrate across borders and blur the boundaries in digital spaces, our identities continue to develop as we interact with each other and different types of food. We will consider how this movement shapes our ideas of ‘foreign’ and ‘local’ and how one becomes the other, as well as the line between honoring a culture and appropriating it.We will examine the intersections of the genre conventions, rhetorical situation, and the writers’ identities to understand how these elements work together when producing texts. We will learn key composition concepts (genre, rhetorical situation, and multimodality) and support thedevelopment of your genre research skills. We will use these concepts and conduct genre research to examine various food writing genres, such as narratives, recipes, and social media posts to understand how writing is an activity that goes beyond putting words together on a pieceof paper. These activities will support your overall genre research skills and deepen your understanding of writing, which can be transferred to other writing activities beyond this course. Classes will be based on genre analysis activities and group discussions. We will read works that address food writing genres and identity, and we will watch documentaries that explore the intersections of food, identity, and migration.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future.

This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of. Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly. This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for public communication. Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits. The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other. This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches. Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation. All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course. This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches. Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None.

HS5063,W27,"McKown, Jamie",Conspiracy Theories and Theories of Conspiracy,A,"The fear of the “hidden” enemy that lurks behind the curtain, controlling events from the shadows, is a narrative topos that continually seems to raise its conspiratorial head in all kinds of spaces and venues: from politics to pop culture, movies, novels, music, political speeches, etc. Yet, there is also evidence to suggest that widespread acceptance of these conspiracy “theories” has the potential to cultivate and propagate inherently antidemocratic, divisive, and dangerous beliefs. Those who posit the existence of conspiracies, or at least certain ones, are often dismissed outright as irrational, without any consideration made as to the substance of their claims. Belief in conspiracies, or at least certain ones, is taken as a sign of faulty logic or reason. Yet, despite this, conspiratorial explanations of various phenomenon actually have a long and vibrant history of popular acceptance in US political culture (as well as in other parts of the world). Some have gone so far as to suggest that narratives of conspiracy, as alternative or resistant explanatory frames, are actually a necessary component of democratic political life. After all we know that conspiracies, political and otherwise, have existed in the past, and may exist again in the future. How do we make sense of this tension? If conspiracy theory as a mode of explanation is inherently “irrational,” what does this mean for its enduring presence in our political discourse? Is the only difference between a “reasonable” claim rooted in fear and what we consider the paranoid ramblings of “kooks” and “nutjobs” simply a matter of which one is “correct?” Is there a silver bullet theory or magic wand that would allow us to differentiate the supposed good from the bad? Is the very act of labeling something a conspiracy theory itself a form of political hegemony? Even if conspiracies might exist, is it better to live in a world in which we assume they don’t? What do we actually mean by conspiracy theory in the first place? This seminar will explore a variety of topics related directly to how threats of conspiracy become manifest in public discourse. Readings will focus on secondary research that examines the role of conspiracy theories in political and social life, both in the United States and abroad. We will also supplement this with primary “artifacts” such as pamphlets, social media postings, videos, speeches, etc. Along the way we will also use this as an opportunity to reflect on what inter and trans disciplinary research actually looks like. The study of conspiracy narratives is an ideal example that helps us think about how different fields attempt to make sense of a phenomenon. We will survey, compare, and attempt to synthesize research from a wide range of fields, disciplines and methodologies including those from historians, anthropologists, political scientists, legal scholars, literary critics, psychologists, and others. This is an advanced seminar and students should expect to encounter readings that are rooted in disciplinary perspectives they are not familiar with. Students will need to adapt to shifting perspectives in order to both the various texts in conversation with each other. Evaluation will be based on in-class discussion as well as individual student writing assignments. Students will produce several short length essay assignments during the term as well as a longer research paper at the end of the term. Weekly lab sessions will be used for screenings of primary material and students may also be responsible for at least one primary source presentation during these sessions.

We will study topics such as (i) the short-term fluctuation of the general price level, employment level, and total output level, (ii) the linkages between structural unemployment, economic inequality, and government policies, and (iii) the long-term trajectory of economic growth and the unevenness of capitalist development. Some of the key questions we will explore include: How do we measure the macroeconomy, and what do our conventional measurements often leave out? Why do cyclical economic booms and busts exist and what drives them? What can governments do to limit the costs of job loss on workers? Looking globally, why are some countries rich and other countries poor? How have global living standards improved over the long run, and at what cost to humans, non-human beings, and the environment?This course aims to increase your ability to use abstract, quantitative models to describe and articulate the various ways in which macroeconomic factors frame the condition of possibilities for people, their families, and their communities. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and politically about public policies and debates. You will also expand your capacity for numerical literacy and quantitative skills such as drawing valid conclusions based on data and communicating your reasoning and results effectively and clearly. The course is especially valuable for students with interests in civic engagement, social justices, political transformation, and sustainable development.

Currently twenty-eight countries have joined together in a supra-national political and economic union, creating a political entity unique to a world of sovereign individual nation-states. This course focuses on understanding this complex and evolving union through study of its main political institutions: the European Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. We will look at the workings of and functional relationships between these institutions through readings, meetings with politicians, bureaucrats, and NGOs involved in European-level politics, and visits to each of the institutions during two weeks in Brussels. We will also spend some time in the course looking at the broader political and cultural context in which the institutions operate, through examination of several important current topics in European politics. Topics could include: refugees and migrants in Europe, the reauthorization of the Common Agricultural Policy, Brexit, the rise of right-wing movements across countries in the EU. Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions, a reflective journal kept during their time in Brussels, and a presentation and final essay on a current EU-relevant political issue of their choosing.",,HS
HS3134,W27,"Taneja, Palak",The Empire Writes Back,M,"“You must unlearn what you have learned.” -Yoda, The Empire Strikes Back Before there was Star Wars, there were Empires. What began with the “Age of Discovery” in the 15th and 16th centuries, helmed by Portugal and Spain, took shape with the British and French Empires in the 17th century. The British Empire, in particular, expanded to encompass almost a quarter of the globe at one point. Literature was one of the many tools in the British arsenal to assert control and claim cultural supremacy. Therefore, as the colonized Resistance grew, they used the master’s tools to dismantle the Empire. In response to Joseph Conrad, there was Chinua Achebe; for Charlotte Brontë, a Jean Rhys; and for Rudyard Kipling, a Salman Rushdie. Our job in this course will be to engage with the writings of the colonized Resistance as they developed by looking inward, unlearning, adapting, and remaking the tool of English Literature. We will read the works of some authors mentioned above and more, along with critical theory, films/documentaries, podcasts, and even some Instagram feeds. You will be evaluated based on class participation, oral presentation, response posts, final paper, and a multimodal project. This class will be good for students hoping to expand their understanding and knowledge of literature and canon formation, develop critical thinking skills, and who wish to talk about how academia influences pop culture, like Star Wars.

HS2132,W27,"Tsygankova, Valeria",How Writing Works: Looking Under the Hood,I/M,"So much about writing can feel mystifying when you arrive at college and your writing universe suddenly expands. You might find that the writing “rules” you once learned don’t always apply. A writing strategy you once swore by might stop working. You’ve thought of yourself as a “good writer,” but now that you need to write unfamiliar genres (legal briefs, policy memos, business proposals…), you no longer feel confident. You might experience writer’s block. Picturing writers you admire, who seem to turn out great stories, podcasts, and research articles with ease, you might start to suspect that, after all, you’re a “bad writer.” But what actually happens when expert writers write? How do they become experts? How does anyone progress as a writer? It might feel like the answer to all of these questions is innate genius, or magic, but composition researchers, who study writing, find that development is actually a product of specific practices, dispositions, and acquired knowledge. Many of their findings are counterintuitive and surprising; in one study of undergraduate writers, for instance, those who felt less confident when asked to write in an unfamiliar genre were ultimately more effective than those who felt more confident. (So much for low confidence equating to bad writing). This writing course is an opportunity to get to know the research on writing development, to test out its findings, and to chip away at some disempowering beliefs about writing. Students will experiment with practices that experienced writers use to cope with the complexity and difficulty of writing; they’ll try out strategies that help people write new genres; they’ll get to know themselves better as writers by investigating what works for them and why. In addition to reading the research, students will carry out composition research of their own, adding to our existing body of knowledge and learning transferable research skills that they can draw on in other classes and contexts. Students will be evaluated on this final research project, a shorter metacognition assignment analyzing their own writing processes, and the completion of low-stakes reading and writing assignments that build up to each of these projects. This course welcomes students with no background in rhetoric and composition, as well as students looking to expand on prior knowledge, for instance those who have taken Methods of Tutoring Writing.Level: Introductory./Intermediate Prerequisites: None.

This course highlights the allure, the dangers, uncertainties, risks, and joys of travel expressed in student writing. What words, images, foods, music, rituals, or other sources of inspiration spark curiosity and passions that make us want to go places?Genre analysis, writing, and transdisciplinary research projects will deepen a sense of place as the course explores the rhetoric of travel and its transformative impacts. Students will experiment with, for instance, flash-essays, chronicles, interviews, journals, and field notes. Research projects will spotlight judicious selection of relevant sources, integration of data, and inclusion of multimodal elements. We will consider, too, the relation between travel writing and ethnography, between travel and gender, racial, religious, and ethnic components. Conveying impressions after short or extended excursions, students will recognize and develop which rhetorical strategies are appropriate for particular purposes, situations, audiences, discourse communities, and genres. Maps, films, infographics, letters, newspaper articles, guidebooks, blogs, Instagram posts, diaries, and logs constitute genres that may be examined and created. Students will further hone their craft in writing workshops, conversations, conferences, and presentations. Short excerpts that reflect the intimate connection between travel and writing will be discussed, and the various rhetorical strategies employed by writers such as Matsuo Basho, Tu Fu, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Olaudah Equiano, Mary Kingsley, James Baldwin, Maxine Hong Kingston, Taras Grescoe, Bill Bryson, Annie Dillard, William Least Heat-Moon, Anthony Bourdain, Eileen Myles, Binyavanga Wainaina, and Hans M.

HS1077,W27,"Van Vliet, Netta",Ethnographic Writing,I,"Ethnographic writing, literally the ""writing of a people,"" is anthropology’s primary disciplinary mode of representation, based on participant-observation fieldwork. Early ethnographies were usually written by anthropologists from Europe and the United States about people they had studied in other parts of the world. In the 1970s and on, critical questions about representation increasingly challenged assumptions about ethnographic work, raising questions about objectivity, transparency, politics and the relationship of ethnographers to the people and places about which they are writing. This class will introduce students to a range of ethnographies in the discipline of anthropology, as well as to some of the political, cultural, and intellectual debates and contexts in which these ethnographies were produced. At the same time, we will consider epistemological, ethical, philosophical and methodological issues that such writing involves, including questions about representation, translation, difference and interpretation. In addition to classic ethnographies, we will also read some fiction, travel writing, and journalism. We will consider questions about how ethnographic knowledge is authorized, how assumptions about interpretation shape ethnographic writing, relations between individual and group, and the relations between author and reader. Students will be asked to experiment with ethnographic writing themselves, through a series of short writing assignments as well as a final project. The course is designed to allow students to workshop their own writing. Students will be evaluated on the development and improvement of their own writing over the course of the term, on their attention to observation of selected ethnographic sites, on their ability to critically evaluate and closely read ethnographies as texts, and on their engagement with their peers’ writing in peer review exercises.

Henry David Thoreau once said, ""In wildness is the preservation of the world."" That single sentence and the controversy surrounding that idea provides the central focus of our explorations over the term. This course examines the question of wilderness from multiple perspectives in the hopes of providing an understanding of the concept and real spaces that constitute wilderness. Starting with a week-long canoe trip down Maine's Allagash Wilderness Waterway, we look at historical and contemporary accounts of the value of wilderness, biological, and cultural arguments for wilderness, and the legal and policy difficulties of ""protecting"" wilderness. Considerable time is spent evaluating current criticisms of the wilderness idea and practice. Students are involved in a term-long project involving potential wilderness protection in Maine.

HS2091,W27,"Mahoney, Dan",Forms of Poetry,I/M,"This class is a study of, and a writing workshop in, poetic forms. We will look at constraints, techniques, and directions of contemporary poetry through intensive reading, writing, and criticism of our own poetic work. This background is useful and significant for the study of poetry at any level, and is especially helpful in light of the fact that, for better or worse, free verse techniques have dominated poetry in the twentieth century. This course is valuable for practiced poets, emerging poets, and prose writers alike. Forms of Poetry asks students to pay attention, create poetry of attention, and revel in poetry that is attentive to language; this process will help students develop voice and lyrical content in their own writing. We will look older, “received forms” (Sonnet, Ghazal, Villanelle) and create our own forms by using experimental techniques (homophonic translation, concrete poetry, erasure, nonsense words (i.e. Jabberwocky)) and look to end the term with the amazing Japanese form, Zuihitsu. You might be thinking: Why write with these crazy constraints or in these old timey poetic forms? And what the heck is a Zuihitsu? Those are good questions, questions we will address on a weekly basis. Over the last seventy years, the debates over poetic expression have been shaped in visceral ways, from “raw” versus “cooked,” “academic” versus “beat,” “formal” versus “antiformal.” This class is designed to deepen your knowledge of these debates and to inspire you to draw upon a variety of modes in your own writing. Evaluations: Students will be expected to contribute to a class blog, write several poems a week, revise poetic output, participate in class workshop, and hand sew a chapbook of their own revised, creative work.

HS3061,W27,"Van Vliet, Netta",Postcolonial Islands,M,"This course focuses on islands – geopolitically and conceptually – to consider the significance of postcolonial difference for contemporary political questions about representation, violence, exile and diaspora, climate change, poverty, racialization and sexuality. Islands have long been imagined as sites of fantastic possibility and power, as places of refuge and respite as well as places of horror and dread. They are places imagined as home to cannibals and monsters, but also as idyllic vacations spots and safe havens for shipwrecked sailors. Etymologically, the word island carries with it the meaning of both land and water, and islands are defined as fragments of a whole, and simultaneously as whole unto themselves, raising questions about binaries and boundaries between self and other and about the conceptual topographies of territory, land and water, thresholds between here and there. Islands have been sites ripe for colonial ventures, understood as isolated, insular and susceptible to translation and appropriation but also as resistant, bounded and singular, fertile sites of diversity. Islands have also been significant in religious understandings of them as sites for communion with God or as final places of burial. This course will examine islands in these terms as they have been articulated in the literary imagination, in postcolonial studies and ethnography, and in political theory. Drawing on examples such as Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, J.M. Coetzee’s Foe, The Odyssey, Plato’s Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Octave Mannoni’s Prospero and Caliban, Aime Cesaire’s A Tempest, as well as on ethnography in Island Studies (including classic ethnography such as Malinowski’s Trobriand Islands, and recent scholarship such as “The Island Studies Journal” and A World of Islands), we will consider questions about political representation, language and translation, religious, ethnic and sexual difference, the definition of the human, mobility and sovereignty, resistance and domination. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, reading responses, one short analytical essay, and a final exploratory research project that examines Mt. Desert Island in the context of course materials.",,HS
ES1076,W27,"Todd, Sean",Polar Ecology and Exploration,I,"The Arctic and Antarctic represent some of the most extreme environments on the planet. As physical places, both poles play an important role in governing the planet’s climate and heat flow. Both are suspected to be rich in minerals and are thought to perhaps hold short-term relief from current world shortages in natural resources. As ecosystems, both are hugely productive in spite of, and in part because of the extreme temperatures they experience; certain species are found nowhere else and in fact thrive in these remote locales. Superimposed upon these natural environments is the presence of humans. Exploration of both areas has been particularly focused in the past century, with countless stories of the perseverance and persistence of our pioneering spirit. Initially surveyed to forward nationalistic agendas, both poles are now sites of scientific inquiry. In particular, the political model that currently governs Antarctica as one massive Protected Area has no precedent and perhaps suggests a way forward for environmental agendas working on global scales. More recently, the poles have been exploited by ecotourism businesses.This class examines the provinces of the Arctic and Antarctic, wildernesses whose boundaries can be defined physically, biologically, geologically and politically. We will examine the rich and highly adapted diversity of life as it is affected by local and global oceanography and atmospheric science, and assess the impacts of climate change on these fragile environments. We will also review our relationship with these places and examine what future we might play in preserving, and/or exploiting the polar regime, using Human Ecology as a model for our understanding.

AD1078,W27,"Henderson, Jonathan",Shellac to Spotify: 100 Years of Recorded Music,I,"Around one hundred and fifty years ago people’s relationship to sound and listening began to fundamentally change. No longer just an ephemeral phenomenon, sound became a thing that could be captured, stored, and played back. The first sound recording technology, the Edison Tin Foil Phonograph, induced a minor social panic; people described being unsettled by the uncanny experience of listening to voices from the past. We now take this ability to listen and re-listen to events from the past for granted as we stream music into our earbuds, enjoy the heightened emotions brought on by a film or television score, or feel our bodies resonate with rumbling bass frequencies at a dance party. Shellac to Spotify: 100 Years of Recorded Music explores how music and technology have coevolved over the past hundred years to shape our relationships to sound, music, and listening. We will approach these questions with both hands-on assignment and from the perspectives of the academic fields of ethnomusicology and sound studies. Students will experiment with music technologies: creating an analog cassette mix tape, soldering together a theremin, composing with analog synthesizers, conducting low-power radio transmissions, experimenting with autotune and digital sequencers, exploring algorithmic music composition, and learning the basics of sound recording and editing in a digital audio workstation (DAW). In addition to weekly hands-on activities, students will read academic texts exploring how the intersection of music and technology reflect and condition social values, norms, and ways of knowing the world.

Ventures have been for-profit and non-profit, encompassing the range from local businesses to scalable start-ups. Students selected for the Hatchery are required to devote an entire term to launching their venture. Each Hatchery enterprise, whether a team or an individual, must take the course for a minimum of three credits. Along with weekly instructional meetings, students receive office space, supplies, professional services, mentors and potential access to seed capital to develop their ventures. After the initial ten weeks of class, if students decide to continue their enterprises, they have access to the Hatchery space and resources for an additional nine months. The Hatchery takes place in three phases:--Application: Students apply for a position in the Hatchery over winter term. --Rapid Prototype: The ten weeks of the Hatchery course. Students create a rapid prototype to test their ventures in the marketplace. These prototypes vary widely depending on the type of ventures.--Creating an Enterprise Structure: During the ten weeks of the course, students will have weekly assignments that introduce key elements in an organizational structure and highlight operational considerations that are universal amongst enterprises.--Development: The following 9-months. Students have access to the Hatchery space and resources to continue developing their enterprises. Grading is credit/no credit only.Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Permission of instructor.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others. Students will also select a longer text to read from a list of authors that may include Jonathan Safran Foer, Susan Cain, Felicia Rose Chavez, Claudia Rankine, and others.Students will be evaluated on class participation, written assignments, writing process, and presentations.

HS6012,S27,"Cox, Gray",Learning a Language on Your Own,,"The goal of this course to help each student design and implement an effective learning program for the study of a language of her choice at whatever level of learning she is currently at. A very wide variety of general strategies, resources and practical advice for independent language learning are reviewed in weekly class sessions along with progress and reflection reports from each student that can help guide and motivate independent work. The core common text for this work will be Betty Lou Leaver, Madeline Ehrman and Boris Shekhtman’s ""Achieving Success in Second Language Acquisition"". The primary focus of the class is on the development and implementation of each student’s individually designed plan for learning a language of their choice. Materials for this will be identified by each student as part of their work on their chosen language. Progress in these plans are discussed in one on one weekly meetings with the teacher. Plans may include the use of software, peer tutors, Skype, videos, standard texts, flash cards, specialized technical material, music, visual art, field trips, and a wide variety of other materials as appropriate. Evaluation will be based on the clarity, coherence and effectiveness of the student’s developed plan and the discipline with which they actually pursue it and revise it appropriately as the term progresses.

The literature of the people inhabiting this area reflects the diverse and complex society that has evolved over a period spanning almost 200 years. We will begin by reading selections from Neil Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America and Gloria Anzaldúa’s Borderlands/La Frontera in order to locate ourselves geographically. We will then read a variety of contemporary Mexican and Latinx writers, whose work confronts the border from different perspectives and literary genres which may include: Octavio Paz, Ada Limón, Natalie Scenters-Zapico, Yuri Herrera, Carlos Fuentes, Tomás Rivera, Gloria Anzaldúa, Valera Luiselli, and Jeanine Cummins. We will also consider film (Chulas Fronteras, Espaldas mojadas, Backyard/El traspatio, Sin Nombre, A Touch of Evil) and music from the borderlands to aid in our study of this complex area of the world.

Beginning with the election of Richard Nixon's in 1968 and following up to today, we will focus on the diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia and how this relationship has impacted state actors, economic policies, cultural production, and conceptions of identity. While there will be a heavy focus on traditional state-level diplomatic history, students will also explore a broad array of methodological approaches. Class sessions will include a mix of traditional lecture formats, class discussion, and outside presentations. An evening lab is scheduled in order to screen a variety of cultural artifacts from the various periods we will cover. The primary goal is to give students an intensive 10-week crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.. that defined the later decades of Cold War diplomacy. At the same time there is also time allocated for students to explore their own independent research interests. Given the far-reaching force of Cold War politics into everyday life, individuals with widely varying academic interests will find the course informative and productive. Evaluation will be based on a mix of class participation, individual research assignments, and exams.While this class is designed to compliment the topics covered in The Cold War: Early Years, students are not required to have had this earlier class.

HS4115,S27,"Nguyen, Hien",Political Economy of Genders,M/A,"We live in a time when the struggle for economic survival is life-shortening. We live in a place where the struggles for reproductive justice, the rights of women, the rights of trans and non-binary people, and gay and lesbian freedoms are intensified and weaponized for electoral gains and political power. What are the linkages, visible or hidden, between these two phenomena? How do we bring together Marxist political economy and queer/trans-inclusive feminist analysis to diagnose them? What can the anxieties, fears, and hatreds collected at the site of (trans)genders teach us about the inner working of capitalist (re)production? In turn, how can wrestling with the racial, sexual, and environmental violence that makes contemporary capitalism possible inform our collective struggle for gender and sexual equality and justice?In this seminar, you and I will think through these questions together through the lens of contemporary Marxist–feminist political economy. We will engage contemporary feminist, black, and queer Marxist scholars whose works illuminate the contradictory, exploitative treatment of colonialized, raced, gendered, sexualized human and non-human Others under capitalism. Topically, our focus includes the birth rate crisis and the struggle for reproductive autonomy, contemporary attacks on gender minorities, and queer and trans-centered class struggles.This is an intensive, exploratory seminar. We will read 4-5 texts closely, focusing on each book for two weeks. In the first week, we will identify the book’s main arguments and approaches. In the second week we will re-read the book along with key texts that inform, supplement, or challenge its author(s). Our selection of key texts may include Jenny Brown’s Birth Strike, and Jules Gleeson and Elle O’Rouke (eds.) Transgender Marxism, but there are rooms to replace them with texts that better reflect your interests. You don’t have to be an expert on the debates and issues we engage in, but you must be unafraid and willing to actively grapple with them both intellectually and ethically.The course is intended for students who are interested in approaching contemporary debates about LGBT+ issues, women’s rights, and reproductive justice from a radical, intersectional, and anti-capitalist perspective. It is also valuable for students who want to understand what makes capitalism possible and what may un-make it. You will get the most out of this seminar if you have a working knowledge of the political economy of capitalism, feminist theory, and/or critical social theory.

HS1130,S27,"Taneja, Palak",College Seminar: Women in True Crime,I,"Commercialized in the 16th century through ballads and pamphlets, true crime has been around for a bit. Yet it is in the recent decade or so, with the proliferation of streaming services, social media, and the popularity of podcasts as a genre, that we see a rising interest among women both in the production and consumption of true crime. Statistics vary depending on the source, but the general consensus is that somewhere between 65-80% of the audience for true crime is women. What then is the root of this fascination? What role does gender play in it? And how do we wrap our minds around this phenomenon and the elements—violence, sensationalism, exploitation of victims—that come along with it? These are but some of the questions that we will delve into in this class.Using a genre-based approach, we will study and analyze women-centric true crime books, case files, articles, blogs, podcasts, and documentaries. Our focus will not only be on the content of these works, but also on the forces that shape the writing/composing process: that is, the purpose (awareness, entertainment, reporting, etc.), the intended audience (detectives, true crime enthusiasts, academics, etc.), and the like. For example, when we read I’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and watch the show by the same name, we will devote time to understanding and writing about the stylistic choices that might be particular to a genre, here a non-fiction book and documentary, respectively. Some other examples of works that we would look at are Crime Junkie by Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, and Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer by Liz Garbus. The study of the form and peculiarities of these genres, along with the textbook, Understanding Rhetoric, will help us develop both the vocabulary and the skills to understand and work on our own writing process. This process will be honed further through writing assignments in various genres—in-class freewrites, newspaper reports, crime blogs, reading responses, paper, portfolio reflection letter, and a multimodal project—and a sustained practice of the art of peer-reviewing and revision. In short, you will critically read, think, and write about women in true crime with the end goal of developing skills that will serve you well outside the limits of our theme.Assessment will be based on writing assignments in various genres– in-class freewrites, newspaper reports, crime blogs, reading responses, paper, portfolio reflection letter, and a multimodal project–and a sustained practice of the art of peer-reviewing and revision.

HS1126,S27,"Tsygankova, Valeria",Pushing the Boundaries of the Essay,I,"What comes to mind when you hear the word “essay”? Maybe you think of a formula for essay-writing that you learned long ago: five standardized paragraphs supporting a single thesis with little room for anything else. Maybe this formula has even given you the idea that essays are a mechanical, rulebound, and unexciting kind of writing. And yet, over its centuries-long history, essay-writing has been anything but formulaic—so much so that scholars find it impossible to agree on a set of stable essay conventions. As the editors of the Edinburgh Companion to the Essay (2022) argue, “the essay” isn’t a unitary genre at all. Instead, it’s a “contested space,” marked by many diverse and even competing approaches. This class is a gateway to that contested space. Assigned readings will introduce you to the outer limits of the essay universe. You will meet writers like James Baldwin, Leslie Jamison, Jacqueline Rhodes, and Cathy Park Hong, among many others, who have all made their own unique mark on the tradition. You will discover writers who make linear arguments—and others who embrace digression, fragmentation, and mosaic structures; those who incorporate research and those who write from memory; those who write in one language and those who draw on multiple languages at once; those who write alphabetically and others who produce multimodal and video essays. Studying this vast range of possibilities will help you expand your own toolkit for when you find yourself writing essays for various audiences and rhetorical situations (including, eventually, senior project proposals, independent study proposals, the Human Ecology Essay, fellowship applications and more). We will mine our readings for the diverse strategies that other writers have used for pulling in their readers, communicating their claims, acknowledging others’ thinking, and creating meaningful structures. You will be asked to reflect metacognitively about how you might transfer these strategies to your own writing in academic, professional, and public contexts. You will come away with an expanded sense of what counts as an “essay,” as well as a sharper capacity to analyze specific essay genres—such as research articles, op-eds, and application essays—each of which comes with its own range of conventions and expectations. Moreover, you will write essays for the exciting and imaginative reasons that have motivated other writers before you: to delve into questions that don’t have easy answers, to explore mysteries, to investigate the world—and yourself. Since essays incorporate so many diverse ways of making knowledge, you will also find a mix of modalities in this class: big-group discussions, collaborative analysis of readings, small-group annotation activities, individual focused free-writing, and more. You will be evaluated on 1) an essay that investigates the work of one essay writer who we will read during the term; 2) a final project (that can be a multimodal piece) in which you enact what you have learned about essayistic writing by composing an essay on an intellectual, aesthetic, or ethical question of your own choosing; 3) participation in a recursive writing process that includes reading, drafting, revision, and responding to classmates’ drafts.

HS2020,S27,"Longsworth, Gordon",GIS I: Foundations and Applications,I/M,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets.

AD3077,S27,"Henderson, Jonathan",Black Atlantic Music,M,"In Black Atlantic Music students will work to understand how histories of slavery, colonialism, diasporic imagination, and networks of cultural exchange form the basis for popular music in the African diaspora. Tracing musical and political histories through a series of case studies routed throughout the diaspora, this course aims to develop a theory of “the Black Atlantic” as a sonic geography. After establishing a foundation in the key historical forces leading to the creation of the African diaspora, students will explore case studies related to the development of local and transnational musical styles from salsa to hip-hop, funk, reggae and more. We will explore the intersecting work of artists (such as Janelle Monae, Angélique Kidjo, Fela Kuti, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and Bob Marley) and scholars (such as Paul Gilroy, Angela Davis, Amiri Baraka, and Michael Veal). Equal weight in the course will be given to reading, listening, and writing as valuable modes of interacting with music. Throughout the course of the term, students will learn to listen more closely to sound and to develop a critical capacity for relating these sounds to the political and social worlds from which they emerge. Turning our attention back and forth between the local and the transnational, Black Atlantic Music is a window into how music takes shape in the context of culture, politics, geography and history. Evaluations will be based on regular written responses, a final project, and participation in class discussions and activities. Level: Intermediate.

Maintaining a sketchbook can be both a professionally useful and personally rewarding practice. This multidisciplinary course will encourage students to develop a regular sketchbook practice using animals as the focus of study. It is intended for any student who wishes to improve their sketching and observational skills, gain an understanding of animal anatomy, and learn about local animal life. Students will draw from museum specimens, taxidermy mounts, and live animals using a variety of media and techniques suitable for field sketching. Class will take place in the Dorr Museum and at field sites within Acadia National Park and Hancock County.This course will meet for two three hour sessions per week. The first session will include a lesson about a particular animal taxon, followed by sketching exercises using museum specimens and mounts as references. In the second session, students will draw from live animals in the field. Students will also spend approximately nine hours per week outside of class on additional field sketching assignments, readings, and research.Evaluations will emphasize participation and student growth rather than artistic ability. Our focus will be on practice and learning to effectively record observations, not on creating polished illustrations. Prior experience with drawing is not required.Level: Introductory.

HS2127,S27,"Gibson, David",Maine Energy and Climate Advocacy,I/M,"This practicum will focus on understanding how the Maine Legislature works by participating in the public advocacy process. With the federal government tied up in partisan gridlock, some of the most meaningful climate and energy legislation in recent decades has occurred at the state level. We will examine how bills move through the Legislature from the draft stage to the final version that is voted on by the House and Senate. Students will learn about the ways that the public and professional lobbyists can engage at nearly every stage of the process. Course participants will be introduced to a variety of environmental non-profits, including Sierra Club Maine, Maine Youth for Climate Justice, and the Environmental Priorities Coalition, and learn how they work both independently and collaboratively to advocate for legislation. While this course is Maine-specific, many of the advocacy skills used in public processes may be applicable in other contexts, including municipal, county, and national decision-making. Some of these skills include conducting policy research and analysis, understanding the legislative process, and developing clear written communication. We will read past legislation relating to energy policy, fossil fuel divestment, and tribal sovereignty and discuss why they were successful or not, and whether there were unintended consequences for bills that passed. Students will be required to identify 3 draft bills they find meaningful, draft testimony to present at the public hearing, and work collaboratively with classmates and/or nonprofit organizations to advocate for those issues as they proceed through the legislative process. The course will include at least two weekday field trips to Augusta to attend public hearings and meet with legislators in person.Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions, completion of written assignments, engagement with the material and demonstration of working knowledge of the legislative process.Level: Introductory/Intermediate.

The course will focus mainly on watersheds of Mt Desert Island and some of the larger rivers in Maine and will build upon foundational concepts in Earth Science. The course will feature field, lab, and lecture components. Students will conduct geomorphic mapping (field and GIS), surveying, stream discharge measurements, pebble counts, and other common tools and methods to conduct a term-long field study of multiple island watersheds. Upon returning from the field, students will use their data to calculate flows and sediment loads associated with less frequent flood events. Large magnitude flow events tend to shape steam channels and have implications for human infrastructure and intertidal zone dynamics. Students will be evaluated based on weekly assignments, quizzes, presentations, and the term-long project. Students will work in teams to complete a basin-wide study of one of the island watersheds of interest to community partners for long-term monitoring. The field project will culminate in a written report and presentation. They will work on their project report throughout the term with opportunities for peer review and revision. It is strongly recommended that students have taken high school math courses (algebra and geometry), at least 1 introductory Earth Science course, and are comfortable using Excel.Level: Intermediate.

Using historic makers for inspiration some slide lectures will be included, but each student will be expected to do some research on their own to find inspiration from other artists. Being inclusive of various aesthetics, we’ll explore differing expressions of beauty and students will be expected to engage ways of working outside their own comfort zone. Readings by Rebecca Solnit, Lucy Lippard, Frank Gohlke, Deborah Bright, Robert Adams, Richard Misrach, John Stilgoe, Bill McKibben, and Geoffrey Batchen, among others, will inform our discussions. Weekly shooting assignments, and readings will be expected prior to mid term. After mid term, you will work toward one final project that explores your own personal expressive choices based on your interests and affinities.

ES4066,S27,"Gadeken, Kara",Estuaries,M/A,"The simplest definition of an estuary is a place along a coast where freshwater and saltwater meet; however, estuaries are far from simple. They are complex systems driven by a fascinating network of interactions and feedbacks. This course offers a comprehensive exploration of estuaries as complex systems, integrating their physical, chemical, biological, and ecological processes. We will cover advanced topics such as estuarine hydrodynamics, sediment transport, productivity, ecosystem function, and biogeochemical cycling. Every estuary is different and throughout the course we will examine case studies of different estuaries, developing a global perspective on their variety. After building a foundation of knowledge on estuarine processes, we will explore how these systems respond to perturbation, how they exercise resilience, and how pivotal features of estuarine networks can be drastically altered by human activities. Estuaries are at the intersection of myriad anthropogenic influences and are critical environments supporting human survival, health and happiness. Together we will explore the various ways that humans interact with and affect these systems.We meet twice a week for in-class work, and once every other week for an extended afternoon lab session when we go on field trips to explore local estuaries. The course also involves one required weekend field trip to a far off-site estuarine system. Assessment in the course will be based on case study problem sets, reading responses, and a term project.This course is intended as an advanced offering for students interested in environmental research, management, and/or restoration. A solid background in marine biology, environmental science, or related disciplines is essential to succeed in the course. Experience and comfort with mathematics (particularly the basics of calculus) will also be very beneficial.

HS2020,F27,"Longsworth, Gordon",GIS I: Foundations and Applications,I/M,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Pre-requisites: Basic computer literacy.

We examine, as background, the nature and limitations of international law as a force for change. The course will then explore customary law, the relationship between soft and hard law, enforcement of international law, implementation mechanisms, and the effectiveness of multilateral environmental agreements. Special attention is given to existing international environmental law frameworks addressing climate change, Arctic and Antarctic development, ozone depletion, biological diversity, forest loss, export of toxic chemicals, and the host of issues raised by the 1992 United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and subsequent environmental fora. Students will also consider the interface between international environmental law and other important international forces such as the Bretton Woods institutions, human rights frameworks, and international development entities. Students will be evaluated on the quality of their classroom comments and several analytical problem sets given during the term. Students will also be asked to complete a major research project examining the effectiveness of a treaty or a proposed international environmental legal arrangement. Level: Advanced.

The course centers on the questions: What would it take to ensure access to healthy, safe, affordable, culturally appropriate foods for all people? The first part of the course critically examines capitalist food systems with particular attention to the ways culture, politics, and economics shape our interactions with food. Through readings and exercises, we explore issues such as nutrition, worker safety, contested agricultural and land use policies, hunger, and environmental and community health. The second part of the course examines case studies of transformative food movements around the world, from the Zero Hunger programs in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to La Via Campesina global campaign for agrarian reform. We focus particularly on food sovereignty and agroecology movements. The final third of the course focuses on transformative work in Maine and at COA. Students take multiple field trips to participate in local movements and to learn about their philosophies, objectives, and activities. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze how power shapes food systems and articulate a theory of change for addressing a food systems problem of their choice.

HS4111,F27,"Waldron, Karen",Epic Heroines: Feminist Retellings of  Mythologies,M/A,"This course will explore heroines from two Hindu epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana, alongside the Greek mythological figures Ariadne, Medusa, Circe, and Galatea. Both sets of heroines have generated deeply rooted cultural archetypes. Central to the upbringing of more than half of the Indian population through comic books, TV shows, movies, and the like, the Hindu epics have set the standard for what an ideal Hindu woman should be, bolstering the patriarchal system in the name of religion and culture. Much like Helen of Troy, “the face that launched a thousand ships” in Greek mythology, some of these women have been the cause of wars of “epic proportions.” Others have become infamous archetypes for women’s witchiness and trouble-making, especially in Greek epics Western authors have retold. Myths of their beauty or its opposite have long been part of these narratives, but do we hear them speak? What do we know about the power they yield? Epics and mythologies have been unable to provide us with concrete answers.Therefore, we will turn to female authors like Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Kavita Kané, Volga, and Vaishnavi Patel for the Hindu epics and Madeline Miller, Jennifer Saint, and Rosie Hewlett for the Greek tales. These authors have created spaces where women’s voices can be heard and analyzed, where archetypal and epic types can be studied as multifaceted humans. We’ll not only read their novels closely but also supplement their work with feminist theory and short videos. Eventually, we’ll trace how these epics stay relevant with regard to the construction of gender and sexuality in the modern Indian and Western world.Students will be evaluated based on class participation, an oral presentation, response posts, final paper, and a multimodal project. This class will be good for students who are interested in reading feminist literature and theory and understanding the enduring power of epics and myths as well as the contemporary feminist purpose in giving their heroines voice.

This course highlights the allure, the dangers, uncertainties, risks, and joys of travel expressed in student writing. What words, images, foods, music, rituals, or other sources of inspiration spark curiosity and passions that make us want to go places?Genre analysis, writing, and transdisciplinary research projects will deepen a sense of place as the course explores the rhetoric of travel and its transformative impacts. Students will experiment with, for instance, flash-essays, chronicles, interviews, journals, and field notes. Research projects will spotlight judicious selection of relevant sources, integration of data, and inclusion of multimodal elements. We will consider, too, the relation between travel writing and ethnography, between travel and gender, racial, religious, and ethnic components. Conveying impressions after short or extended excursions, students will recognize and develop which rhetorical strategies are appropriate for particular purposes, situations, audiences, discourse communities, and genres. Maps, films, infographics, letters, newspaper articles, guidebooks, blogs, Instagram posts, diaries, and logs constitute genres that may be examined and created. Students will further hone their craft in writing workshops, conversations, conferences, and presentations. Short excerpts that reflect the intimate connection between travel and writing will be discussed, and the various rhetorical strategies employed by writers such as Matsuo Basho, Tu Fu, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Olaudah Equiano, Mary Kingsley, James Baldwin, Maxine Hong Kingston, Taras Grescoe, Bill Bryson, Annie Dillard, William Least Heat-Moon, Anthony Bourdain, Eileen Myles, Binyavanga Wainaina, and Hans M.

HS1102,F27,"McKown, Jamie","Equal Rights, Equal Voices: Articulating Suffrage",I,"This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century woman suffrage activists in the United States. This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott, Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who are generally less well known today. While this is a course rooted in the history of what we might consider early American feminism, it should come as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront issues that continue to have salience today. Many of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity, equality, empowerment, and political allyship that these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant for us to consider in our contemporary context. This is especially true when it comes to the topic of race and the intersectional nature of the discourse around gender equality, both then and now. We will spend time examining how the idea of race was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and inclusionary ways, within these texts. We will also look specifically at the works of early Black feminists in the United States, and the myriad of ways they navigated the challenges of the moment, especially as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of white supremacy within the early woman suffrage movement. Rather than rely primarily on secondary historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials, mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers “in their own words.” In addition, students will also take part in “hands on” recovery projects designed to locate, transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible works from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring and making effective use of various types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in recent years. Class sessions will be organized as a discussed based seminar. Assignments will emphasize critical, reflective, and analytical writing. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short written response papers, two longer form take-home essays, individual presentations, and a final “recovery” project.

HS1119,F27,"Nguyen, Hien",Introduction to Microeconomics,I,"Economics has a popular reputation as a field of study centered around making money and getting rich. However, for most of its history, economics has been about understanding and changing the way the world works. How do we get our dinner every night? What does it take to transform coffee beans harvested in plantations in Costa Rica to the morning cup of Starbucks across their 38,000 global locations? Why do some individuals amass unfathomable personal wealth while others face daily struggle for material survival? These questions are what economists primarily study. Whether seemingly straightforward or seemingly unfathomable, at their core these issues are about the process of social provisioning. It can be further broken down into the following questions: (i) As a society, how do we determine what to produce and how much? (ii) As a society, how do we distribute what we produce? And (iii) Who benefits from and who are harmed by our production, distribution and consumption? In this course, we will examine these questions from the perspective of individuals and firms, and we will consider the ways an individual’s preference and decisions are shaped by social institutions and how they, in turn, affect other beings, both human and non-human. You will be introduced to topics such as: individual’s decision making under constraints, social coordination dilemmas, firm’s wage-setting and labor discipline, supply-demand and price setting, market’s successes and failures, and the limits of economic growth. This course aims to increase your ability to use abstract, quantitative models to approach complex, real-world problems such as worsening economic inequalities and global climate change. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and politically about public policies and debates. You will also expand your capacity for numerical literacy and quantitative skills such as drawing valid conclusions based on data and communicating your reasoning and results effectively and clearly. The course is especially valuable for students with interests in civic engagement, social justices, political transformation, and sustainable development.

HS1126,F27,"Tsygankova, Valeria",Pushing the Boundaries of the Essay,I,"What comes to mind when you hear the word “essay”? Maybe you think of a formula for essay-writing that you learned long ago: five standardized paragraphs supporting a single thesis with little room for anything else. Maybe this formula has even given you the idea that essays are a mechanical, rulebound, and unexciting kind of writing. And yet, over its centuries-long history, essay-writing has been anything but formulaic—so much so that scholars find it impossible to agree on a set of stable essay conventions. As the editors of the Edinburgh Companion to the Essay (2022) argue, “the essay” isn’t a unitary genre at all. Instead, it’s a “contested space,” marked by many diverse and even competing approaches. This class is a gateway to that contested space. Assigned readings will introduce you to the outer limits of the essay universe. You will meet writers like James Baldwin, Leslie Jamison, Jacqueline Rhodes, and Cathy Park Hong, among many others, who have all made their own unique mark on the tradition. You will discover writers who make linear arguments—and others who embrace digression, fragmentation, and mosaic structures; those who incorporate research and those who write from memory; those who write in one language and those who draw on multiple languages at once; those who write alphabetically and others who produce multimodal and video essays. Studying this vast range of possibilities will help you expand your own toolkit for when you find yourself writing essays for various audiences and rhetorical situations (including, eventually, senior project proposals, independent study proposals, the Human Ecology Essay, fellowship applications and more). We will mine our readings for the diverse strategies that other writers have used for pulling in their readers, communicating their claims, acknowledging others’ thinking, and creating meaningful structures. You will be asked to reflect metacognitively about how you might transfer these strategies to your own writing in academic, professional, and public contexts. You will come away with an expanded sense of what counts as an “essay,” as well as a sharper capacity to analyze specific essay genres—such as research articles, op-eds, and application essays—each of which comes with its own range of conventions and expectations. Moreover, you will write essays for the exciting and imaginative reasons that have motivated other writers before you: to delve into questions that don’t have easy answers, to explore mysteries, to investigate the world—and yourself. Since essays incorporate so many diverse ways of making knowledge, you will also find a mix of modalities in this class: big-group discussions, collaborative analysis of readings, small-group annotation activities, individual focused free-writing, and more. You will be evaluated on 1) an essay that investigates the work of one essay writer who we will read during the term; 2) a final project (that can be a multimodal piece) in which you enact what you have learned about essayistic writing by composing an essay on an intellectual, aesthetic, or ethical question of your own choosing; 3) participation in a recursive writing process that includes reading, drafting, revision, and responding to classmates’ drafts.

HS1120,F27,"Van Vliet, Netta",Introduction to Cultural Anthropology,I,"This course is an introduction to some of the central questions, arguments, and concepts of Cultural Anthropology. Broadly defined, “cultural anthropology” is the study of human cultures. Historically, such study has focused on explorations of difference through conducting fieldwork over an extended period of time in a specific community. Understandings of the discipline have changed over time, from definitions of it as an objective social science in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when anthropology was dominated by European and U.S. anthropologists conducting fieldwork in places in Africa, Latin America and Asia, to definitions of it as a subjective interpretative social science that has been transformed and critiqued by anthropologists across the globe studying a wide range of human cultures and institutions, including their own societies. In the 1970s and 1980s, anthropologists began to “study up” through focusing on cultures of entities such as the World Bank, corporations, the military, scientists and investment bankers. Today, almost anything can be a focus for anthropological study.In this class we will address questions and arguments about structure, difference, power, colonialism, politics, representation and responsibility, both in terms of cultural anthropology’s own formation as a colonial discipline, and in terms of the tools for critical thinking that have emerged out of anthropological work. What kinds of social organization and economic systems tie people together? What produces conflict? What is the significance of myths, rituals and symbols? How are social systems reproduced over time? How do they change? What is the significance of relations of identification and interaction between individuals and group categories? What are the political implications of how the human is defined? As we learn about how different thinkers have engaged these questions, we will also critically examine the concepts that inform them, including ideas of agency, responsibility, representation and action. Texts will likely include work by Ruth Benedict, Lee D. Baker, Franz Boas, Jacques Derrida, Emile Durkheim, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Clifford Geertz, Zora Neale Hurston, Alfred Kroeber, Claude Levi-Strauss, Karl Marx, Sidney Mintz, Rosalind Morris, Anand Pandian, Gayle Rubin, Marshall Sahlins, Edward Said, Marilyn Strathern, Deborah Thomas, Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Victor Turner, and Eric Wolf.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others.

ES3104,F27,"Slabach, Brittany",Vertebrate Zoology,M,"In this course, we will explore the phylogenetic, morphological, and ecological diversity of vertebrates within an evolutionary framework. Using a comparative approach, we will explore the diversity of major vertebrate groups, with a focus on local representatives; interpret major evolutionary transitions; and identify the relationships between structure and function. We will practice developing hypotheses about vertebrate ecology and evolution, considering morphological, behavioral, ecological, and life history traits. The laboratory component will be a mixture of work with museum specimens, dissections, and fieldwork. We will focus on nomenclature of anatomy, standard necropsy and identification techniques, including use of taxonomic keys. Fieldwork will introduce methods to survey and monitor vertebrates, including standard capture, handling, and marking techniques. The laboratory is scheduled with early field mornings in mind. Days we are not conducting field work, we will meet later for lab. There is a required weekend field trip. This class involves a fair amount of reading and memorization to help develop a strong foundation in the taxonomy of vertebrates, as this course is a prerequisite for other advanced vertebrate courses.

Griffith, pioneer of early cinema, prophesied in 1924 that by 2024 cinema would have been instrumental in ""eliminating from the face of the civilized world all armed conflict"". Where have things gone wrong? Cinema is a powerful medium that in many ways is still struggling to find its place among the other arts; there are many promising byways that have been overlooked or under-explored. This course explores the histories, production and meanings of motion pictures. Using various films as case studies, we will look at the development of film forms, techniques and genres from 1946 to the present - the second half of cinema history. Films studied will include examples of narrative, documentary, animation, and the avant-garde. Students will learn concepts of film analysis and criticism, and will have opportunities to practice critical skills in class discussions and in research and writing assignments. Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation in class discussion, written papers, and research presentations. Film gives us the opportunity to, in the words of David Lynch, ""get lost in another world...to dream in the dark"". Who decides which dreams we will see?

What are the possibilities and limitations of responding to or representing a place through sound recording and playback? How do contemporary composers and sound artists engage place-specific material in their work? This practice-based course examines the interdisciplinary field of sound studies through close reading, listening, and hands-on (ears-on?) work in sound. Students will create place-based recording projects and site-specific sound installations that draw on local fieldwork excursions around Frenchman Bay, as well as on archival research connected to the Maine Sound and Story Archive and others. Students will sharpen skills in field recording, audio editing, multi-channel sound mixing and presentation, artistic collaboration, and building sonic-rich soundscapes as they work to create immersive sound art projects. This class will work to expand the narrative podcast format, seeking more abstract and layered forms that draw on research and storytelling to help audiences sense a place or a concept through the experience of sound. The course will examine key readings in the field of sound studies, and investigate the practice of sound artists working at the intersections of sound and climate change, sound and social (in)justice, the repatriation of sound recordings, sound and ethnographic practice, and more.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques.

AD1072,F27,"Soares, Zach",Audio Production as Compositional Tools,I,"In 1979, the music producer Brian Eno argued that the recording studio is a “compositional tool,” upending the idea that the recording studio exists to document pre-existing musical compositions. His assertion came on the back of pivotal albums such as The Beatles’ “Revolver” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966), which demonstrated the creative possibilities of composing in the studio. We might call this type of approach to music composition “playing the studio.” In this course, students learn how music production makes use of editing, mixing, and effect processing to maximize its impact. Through readings, film screenings, and audio listening sessions, students learn about past and present studio techniques and use these techniques during audio projects and exercises. Students learn to use virtual instruments, effect processors, microphones, and COA’s recording studio to strengthen their technical audio recording, editing, and mixing skills.

Using a broad range of materials, students are encouraged to work intuitively and take multiple approaches to presenting ideas–especially ideas that may not have been explored previously in their work–and develop them in different ways. Students will create large quantities of drawings based on prompts that will then be discussed with the class. What stands out? What makes a piece surprising or interesting? What revisions can be made to strengthen these moments or motifs? These are kinds of questions that will inform our discussions.Taken together, these drawings will offer a broad range of possibilities that will then be explored for the rest of the term, during which students will develop a body of work. Students will meet weekly as a group to discuss work made or advanced in the previous week and meet individually with the instructor every other week to discuss materials and other aspects of their art practices. The work made over the course of the term should include material investigation (why are you using the materials you’re using and how does it support your thematic interests?) and embody a range of conceptual concerns. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to several artists’ working methods. Students are expected to work independently and have some degree of familiarity with the materials they choose to work with.“Drawing” is used broadly here: students working in any medium are encouraged to take this course (for example, a student interested in three-dimensional work might respond to the prompts with forms made from cardboard or other found materials). This course is designed to kickstart a nascent practice or one that might have become dormant or plateaued as well as give students room to experiment and then build on these experiments. Students enrolling in this class should have some form of previous studio experience. Evaluation will be based on students’ work, participation in class discussions, the ability to offer critical and constructive feedback to one’s peers, and the ability to push oneself beyond one’s comfort zone or perceived limitations—especially when it comes to allowing the work to evolve and change in response to feedback and critique.

HS1065,W28,"Lakey, Heather",Philosophies of Good and Evil,I,"Good and evil are timeless topics and they have motivated centuries of philosophical thinking. Although the terms “good” and “evil” are commonly used across a range of discourses, they are ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In an effort to explore different ideas about good and evil, this course provides a broad overview of the issues, arguments, and debates that shape philosophical ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What are the origins of good and evil? What makes an action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What should we do with someone who commits a horrific act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? What kinds of ethical theories operate without the concepts of good and evil? Is evil an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of good and evil help or hinder moral thinking?To critically unpack these questions, we will read works by ethical thinkers including Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, Hannah Arendt, Zhuangzi, Simone de Beauvoir, Abû Nasr al-Fârâbî, Nell Noddings, Peter Singer, Kwame Gyekye, Mencius, Sherman Alexie, and others. Along the way, we will study deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, ethical relativism, feminist ethics, Taoism, and existential ethics.

But what do we mean by “nature,” and what distinguishes a natural environment from a social one? Moreover, what kinds of relationships should we cultivate with our natural environments? This discussion-based course explores the concepts of nature and environmental responsibility across different philosophical and cultural frameworks. We will draw on a variety of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism, deep ecology, American transcendentalism, indigenous studies, queer theory, and Buddhism. We will read selections from thinkers such as John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, Arne Naess, Val Plumwood, Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau, Eduardo Kohn, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Thich Nhat Hanh, Anna Tsing, and others. Guiding questions include the following: What is nature? How is the idea of nature politicized and socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations to nature? How should humans relate to nature? What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction between humans and nature? Although this course will focus primarily on theoretical questions, we will also discuss issues in applied ethics such as, control over natural resources, wilderness preservation, sustainability, and consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit questions pertaining to environmental activism, and we will consider how philosophy can help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities and obligations.

This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of. Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly. This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for public communication. Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits. The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other. This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches. Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation. All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course. This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice.

How are the shifts toward digital forms of production and exchange challenging the “laws” of supply and demand and other t political economic processes? How will the digitalization of nature intensify and transform the ways in which the commodification of nature has altered ecological systems? What will happen when AI saturates our political and economic life while it simultaneously depletes the planet? How will AI shape our understanding of ourselves and our societies? How do we, individually and collectively, grapple with ethical and existential issues that AI proliferation has raised and will continue to raise? Is it all too late, or is it merely a beginning? In this course students will approach these questions through the lens of political economy, which focuses on how the quest for power and profit has shaped the development and deployment of AI, and how AI applications, in turns, are disrupting and transforming our society and our planet. The course will draw on traditional methods of Political Economic analysis and tools from Futures Studies such as scenario building and the Delphi Method. Topics addressed may include, for instance: challenges in aligning AI systems with human values; open source vs. proprietary models of digital property; the implications of AI and other forms of digital powers for democracy, nation states, and global governance; transformations in labor markets and class structures; and debates over transhumanism and competing visions of technological futures. Our selection of key texts may include Gray Cox’s Smarter Planet or Wise Earth, Kate Crawford’s Atlas of AI, and Nick Dyer-Witherford et al. ‘s Inhuman Power. The course is valuable for any students who want to investigate the development trajectory of AI and its predecessors, to engage critically with the impacts and contradictions of AI implementation, and to cultivate a creative imagination about the future of life and work when AI becomes ubiquitous. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed the abilities to: 1.) understand and explain key features of the emerging forms of AI and related technologies and their impacts on human ecological systems; 2.) use theoretical analyses and empirical evidence to critically engage with conflicting discourses from various political economic traditions regarding AI-related technologies; 3.) envision competing scenarios of the future with AI and critically analyze the conceptual and practical insights which they may offer.Students will be evaluated through a combination of reading responses, in-class participation, short papers, and a final symposium in which students will present and debate their visions for the future political economy of AI and/or how AI will transform political economic systems around the world.Level: Introductory.

This course examines both the roots of efforts through the 1960s and 1970s by newly decolonized states to change the economic architecture of the global system, and current initiatives for reform to the global economy, including through calls for a NIEO II. The text for the first half of the course is Adom Getachew’s Worldmaking after Empire: the rise and fall of self-determination. This part of the course explores the efforts by leaders of anti-colonial struggles in the Caribbean and Africa to shape a new post-imperial world, both politically and economically, building to the effort in the UNGA for the NIEO declaration. The second half of the course will focus on the international trade and financial institutions (World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, multilateral development banks), their role in ongoing sovereign debt crises, and current efforts underway to reform the international financial architecture shaped by these institutions. The course will be conducted as an advanced seminar, with significant student responsibility for leading our conversations. Evaluation will be based on contributions to the collective learning throughout the term, regular short essays on course material, and one or more presentations made to the class on historical figures or topics of interest to them. As this is an advanced seminar, students taking the class should have had one or more previous courses in areas related to politics or economics.Level: Advanced.

Nobody exemplifies these notions better than Rushdie himself. Therefore, this course will be an exploration of the fantastical world of Salman Rushdie through his seminal novel Midnight’s Children. Deemed as one of the Great Books of the 20th century, which won the Booker prize the year of its publication, 1981, and the Booker of Bookers twice over (in 1993 and 2008), the novel is a prime example of postcolonialism with a magical realist twist.In this class, we will take a deep dive into Rushdie’s novel by paying close attention to the prose and his style and the history and contexts that he sets up in this novel. Therefore, the reading of the novel will be supplemented with historical background and literary criticism that bring up questions of utopia, nation, politics, identity, and subalternity, to name a few.

HS1131,W28,"Tsygankova, Valeria",Animals and Arguments,I,"In 1903, American naturalist John Burroughs triggered a fierce public debate when he accused some of his peers of writing “sham natural history.” These other naturalists, Burroughs claimed, had given in to the major temptation lying in wait for all nature writers: “the danger of making too much of what we see and describe—of putting in too much sentiment, too much literature—in short, of valuing these things more for the literary effects we can get out of them than for themselves.” The ensuing debate over the responsible depiction of nonhuman nature went on for five years in the pages of popular magazines, drawing in dozens of writers and one U.S. president. More than a century later, we remember it as the “nature faker” controversy. But though this episode has taken its place in the history books, its unresolved tensions and questions live on, occupying nature writers and filmmakers to this day: How can writers tell stories that spark human interest in the natural world while doing justice to that world’s alterity? What does it mean to value nonhuman animals “for themselves” and not for the reasons we might project onto them? Are emotion and imagination incompatible with good nature writing? In this writing class, students will not only get to know this longstanding conversation; they will also be asked to weigh in. Students will study the strategies that help experienced writers make their own marks on existing debates: strategies for posing rich problems, analyzing texts, representing and responding to other voices, giving and using feedback, and otherwise developing a sustainable writing practice. Students will become better navigators of writing for various contexts and audiences by studying and practicing the ways in which public and scholarly writers convey their ideas to readers. Students will be evaluated on a rhetorical analysis of a single text; an analytical essay that incorporates multiple sources and makes an original argument; a reflection that analyzes their own approach to writing; participation in in-class work; and the completion of short, low-stakes assignments preparing them for class. This course will be helpful for new college students looking to establish a base of knowledge about analytical writing, as well as for students at any point in their college careers who want to dedicate some time to working on their writing.Level: Introductory.

Taking a multifaceted view of human relationships with nature, students will generate research projects driven by questions about tourism and eco-tourism, species population change, climate degradation, the role of technology, and development of wildlands and waterways. Research discussed in class will also center on environmental values and challenges expressed by ecocritics, naturalists, biologists, philosophers, archaeologists, psychologists, poets, filmmakers, and others from the nineteenth century to the present. Several local excursions will provide opportunities for taking field notes. Students will be encouraged to experiment with different forms of writing, expanding their genre analysis, rhetorical awareness, and research practices, while deepening their own relationship with nature. Sharing work during peer reviews will become integral, uncovering and inspiring various writing processes.This transdisciplinary, experiential approach will help establish a strong foundation for students’ writings outside this course and for evaluating possible impacts on the environment by potential encroachments. Spanning memoir, travel, science and nature, cultural issues, and current events, short readings will include writers such as Wendell Berry, Charles Darwin, Susan Fenimore Cooper, Luther Standing Bear, Jacquetta Hawkes, Richard Wright, Edward Abbey, N.

HS2128,W28,"Van Vliet, Netta","Authoritarianism, Conflict, Collaboration",I/M,"This course draws on multiple disciplines and interdisciplinary fields (anthropology, literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, history, postcolonial and feminist studies) to explore questions about authoritarian and anti-authoritarian contexts and practices. Authoritarianism, broadly defined, is characterized by centralized power, repression of dissent, and pressure to obey authority. Dictatorship, totalitarianism, and fascism all name forms of authoritarian regimes. It can be easy to recognize authoritarianism when it has become established in such forms. But what does it look, feel and sound like in terms of how it can infiltrate our daily systems? In this class, we will consider how authoritarianism can take hold through looking at dynamics of power in the relations, discourses and structures that make up everyday sites such as the home, family, the school, places of worship, and the workplace. On the flip side, we will also consider examples of collaboration in contexts of conflict and disagreement. What does working (and learning, teaching, and living) together in contexts of conflict, and with multiple forms of difference and disagreement, involve? The course will include attention to the significance of the nation-state as a form of political organization that dominates the globe today. We will also consider examples of social and political movements that have emerged in response to state repression in the 20th and 21st centuries in different parts of the world, as well as contemporary discourses about racism and anti-racism, sexual violence, war, capitalism and economic power, and disagreement and conflict.Some of the questions we will examine over the term include: How do we understand relations between truth and power (and how are these terms defined)? How do we know what we think we know (epistemology)? What is structural power? What is the significance of relations between individual and group for how we respond to tensions between “individual freedom” and “collective or community wellbeing”? What is the significance of private/public distinctions for politics? Course materials will likely include work by Louis Althusser, Nur Amali Ibrahim, Benedict Anderson, Hannah Arendt, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Verónica Gago, Adolf Hitler, William Mazzarella, George Orwell, Edward Said, Carl Schmitt, Timothy Snyder, Gayatri Spivak and Luisa Valenzuela, among others.

HS2081,W28,"Van Vliet, Netta",Postcolonial Studies and Psychoanalysis,I/M,"The course considers the definition of the human by bringing together the field of postcolonial studies with the field of psychoanalysis. Both postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis engage questions of sexualized and racialized difference in the context of 20th century Europe and the legacies of colonialism. Postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis both also contend with notions of individual and collective well-being, with belonging and exclusion. Psychoanalysis is a colonial discipline which produced a form of analysis that emerged in the time of colonialism. As such, psychoanalysis contributed to colonial notions of civilized and primitive, of man and woman, of normal and abnormal, of Europe and its others. At the same time, however, contexts of anticolonial struggle in turn shaped psychoanalytic thought. By examining texts central to these two fields, this course considers how psychoanalytic thought can help us understand the processes through which individuated subjects become defined in terms of collective groups of belonging such as the nation, and how filiation and family is connected to affiliation and nation, through relations of affect and concepts of representational politics.We will begin with an introduction to the inception of psychoanalysis in Europe, and examine how it travels and is taken up in Europe’s colonies. Drawing on postcolonial theory and literature, we will learn about the historical emergence of the term “postcolonial,” the political and disciplinary debates to which the term gave rise, and its relation to ideas of nationalism, diaspora, Orientalism. Geographically, we will examine examples of anticolonial struggle in Algeria, India, and Palestine/Israel. Readings will focus on texts by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida, the Subaltern Studies group, and scholars who directly engage with these thinkers, including Jacques Lacan, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Gayatri Spivak.

The course begins by acknowledging the historical realities that limited women’s narrative options in the publishing industry until quite recently. We will examine a relatively unknown yet rather extraordinary short novel from 1967: Sawako Ariyoshi’s The Doctor’s Wife. After Ariyoshi, we will read from quite varied authors published within the last fifty years, writers such as: Buchi Emecheta, Clarice Lispector, Nawal El Saadawi, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Hanan al-Shaykh, Jeannette Winterson, Rose Tremain, Nora Okja Keller, Fadia Faqir, and Yvonne Vera. We will also read some classic and contemporary feminist literary theory to gain a sense of how feminist scholars approach women’s novels and our questions. The course is especially designed for students interested in women’s and gender issues who have had some previous experience with literary analysis, close reading of texts, and/or feminist theory. As one way to do the work of an intermediate/advanced class, each student will choose an additional author to investigate, either a novelist or theorist who has published since 2000, and read a novel or theoretical essay by this author outside of class. Students will be evaluated based on class engagement, response papers, passage analyses, a presentation to the class of the outside novel or theory and the questions it raises, and a final evaluation essay.

We will study topics such as (i) the short-term fluctuation of the general price level, employment level, and total output level, (ii) the linkages between structural unemployment, economic inequality, and government policies, and (iii) the long-term trajectory of economic growth and the unevenness of capitalist development. Some of the key questions we will explore include: How do we measure the macroeconomy, and what do our conventional measurements often leave out? Why do cyclical economic booms and busts exist and what drives them? What can governments do to limit the costs of job loss on workers? Looking globally, why are some countries rich and other countries poor? How have global living standards improved over the long run, and at what cost to humans, non-human beings, and the environment?This course aims to increase your ability to use abstract, quantitative models to describe and articulate the various ways in which macroeconomic factors frame the condition of possibilities for people, their families, and their communities. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and politically about public policies and debates. You will also expand your capacity for numerical literacy and quantitative skills such as drawing valid conclusions based on data and communicating your reasoning and results effectively and clearly. The course is especially valuable for students with interests in civic engagement, social justices, political transformation, and sustainable development.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets.

HS4114,W28,"Cline, Ken",Rights of Nature or Wildlife Law,M/A,"Does nature have rights? There is a growing global movement answering that question in the affirmative. But what does that mean and how does it function in legal and political systems? The Rights of Nature (RoN) movement(s) has the potential to revolutionize environmental law and our relationship to the planet. Many believe that existing environmental law is inadequate to solve the critical problems of climate change, habitat loss, and mass extinction. The RoN movement proposes strategies that include granting rights to nature through legal personhood and assigning property rights to rivers, culturally important plants, specific animals, and wildlife. The course explores both the promise and perils of this approach while also exploring the field’s multifarious origins, including Indigenous Law. By examining the concepts of rights, constitutionalism, standing, human rights law, and eco-centric law, students will gain an understanding of the context of the RoN movement. Although a powerful rhetorical concept, implementation of RoN as a legal strategy has been challenging and has met with mixed success. Fundamental questions of “who speaks for the trees” and what obligations are conferred when rights are granted are slowly being worked out in courts and national legislatures. These questions are particularly challenging where Western and Indigenous worldviews come together. Fundamentally, this seminar will explore what it takes to recognize the inherent rights of the natural world to “exist, thrive, and evolve.” Students will be evaluated through several written assignments, class presentations, and active and meaningful participation in seminar discussions. Students will be asked to engage in a term-long research project that examines a specific RoN case study. Level: Intermediate/Advanced.

And yet the past century and a half of deep-ocean exploration has revealed an astonishing abundance and diversity of life, with forms and functions that, though seemingly alien, reflect exquisite adaptation to the unique challenges of surviving in such an environment. Our expanding knowledge about the deep ocean is only possible with the boundary-pushing technologies and instruments developed to delve deeper, see further, and collect more from the most remote depths. As we have learned more about the ecosystems in the deep ocean, it has also become clear that human activities are not so removed from them as we once believed. Discussions about deep ocean biology now include debates about our obligation to protect and conserve it.In this course, we will take a tour of the variety of life that exists in the deep ocean, learn about how we observe and study it, and discuss the ways that humans interact with and affect it. Our guiding questions for the course are:What kinds of life exist in different deep ocean ecosystems?How are deep sea organisms adapted to life in an environment of extremes?What technologies are used to study life in the deep ocean and what are their capabilities and constraints?What do we owe to life in the deep ocean in terms of conservation?What do we owe to human society in terms of deep-ocean exploration, discovery, and resource use?We meet twice a week in class and have one afternoon lab period. Classes are a combination of lecture, discussion and activities, and labs focus on one or two elements of deep-sea biology for deeper investigation as a group.

However, the science of restoration is still in its early phases, and important theoretical and practical questions remain to be resolved. This class will critically examine the assumptions that underlie restoration planning, both in the ethical dimension and in the realm of scientific theory. We will consider the validity of conceptual models of ecological communities and ecosystems and the way that these models shape decision-making. We will survey the factors that must be taken into account during restoration and study best-practices approaches, with a focus on adaptive management.

HS1075,S28,"Lakey, Heather",Animals and Ethics,I,"What are our moral obligations to other animals? Should non-human animals have legal rights and moral standing? If so, on what basis? How does the moral treatment of animals change across the contexts of food, research, captivity, and the home? Historically, western philosophers construct the animal in opposition to the human. Why? What is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted with it? How does language shape and produce our relationships with animals? How is the animal represented and characterized, and how does this representation impact our thinking about animal ethics?This discussion-based course explores the relationships between humans and non-human animals. Drawing on fiction, philosophy, and ethology, we will examine our beliefs and assumptions regarding animals, human-animal relations, and the ethical implications of the human-animal binary. This course will focus on a wide range of theoretical approaches, including the traditions of animal liberation and animal rights as articulated by thinkers such as Tom Regan and Peter Singer, the growing field of animal studies as represented by thinkers like Jacques Derrida, and current debates in practical ethics, such as animal experimentation, hunting, and invasive species.Upon completion of the course, students will have refined their understanding of the concept of the animal and they will be familiar with the key legal and ethical debates regarding human-animal relationships. Course requirements include class discussions, weekly writing exercises, a midterm exam, and a final paper or project. Students should come to this class prepared to read challenging philosophical essays and to share their ideas with others.Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None. Class limit: 12. Lab fee: None.

HS1097,S28,"Lakey, Heather",Buddhist Philosophies,I,"What is the nature of self? What is the nature of mind? Why do we suffer? What is enlightenment? This course introduces students to the foundations of Buddhist philosophy and practice. Buddhism encompasses a variety of different traditions, teachings, practices, and goals. In this class, we will adopt a philosophical perspective to explore a range of Buddhist thinking on topics such as reality, consciousness, nothingness, and ethical conduct. We will begin by reading Asvagho?a's Buddhacarita, which tells the story of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha. Next, we will study the Theravada, Buddhism's foundational structure, and then proceed to explore the later Mahayana teachings. This course will study primary literature, including excerpts from the Pali Canon and several Mahayana sutras, alongside selections from contemporary thinkers such as Thích Nhat Hanh, angel Kyodo williams, and Pema Chödrön. Along the way, we will discuss suffering (dukkha), emptiness (suññata), impermanence (anicca), non-self (anatta), interdependence or dependent uprising (pa?iccasamuppada), desire (tanha), the four noble truths, the eightfold path, liberation and enlightenment (nibbana), action and causation (kamma), wisdom (pañña), compassion (karuna and bodhicitta), and our responsibilities to other beings. Although this course primarily focuses on Buddhist theory and Buddhist texts, students will be briefly introduced to different meditation and mindfulness practices through a series of guest speakers and a weekend visit to the Morgan Bay Zendo in Surry, Maine. This course will be conducted in seminar style with an emphasis on class participation. No prior background in Buddhism or philosophy is required.

A very wide variety of general strategies, resources and practical advice for independent language learning are reviewed in weekly class sessions along with progress and reflection reports from each student that can help guide and motivate independent work. The core common text for this work will be Betty Lou Leaver, Madeline Ehrman and Boris Shekhtman’s ""Achieving Success in Second Language Acquisition"". The primary focus of the class is on the development and implementation of each student’s individually designed plan for learning a language of their choice. Materials for this will be identified by each student as part of their work on their chosen language. Progress in these plans are discussed in one on one weekly meetings with the teacher. Plans may include the use of software, peer tutors, Skype, videos, standard texts, flash cards, specialized technical material, music, visual art, field trips, and a wide variety of other materials as appropriate. Evaluation will be based on the clarity, coherence and effectiveness of the student’s developed plan and the discipline with which they actually pursue it and revise it appropriately as the term progresses. Students will be asked to meet with the instructor prior to the start of the term to discuss their motivation, aims, possible resources and possible plans for language learning after the course is over.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others.

HS2020,S28,"Longsworth, Gordon",GIS I: Foundations and Applications,I/M,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Pre-requisites: Basic computer literacy.

We will take up a series of case studies by examining their history, the stakeholders involved, and the pros and cons of the relevant alternative reform measures that have been proposed. Topics covered in a given term will vary based on changing external factors such as the timing of elections as well as student interests. Students enrolling in the class should expect to be contacted by the instructor prior to the start of the term to discuss areas of interest. Likely areas that may be covered include: campaign finance reform, gerrymandering, instant runoff voting, election technologies, voter suppression, alternative governmental models, the electoral college, party primaries, campaign communication regulation, government funding of elections, nationalization of election standards, etc.. This advanced seminar will emphasize collaborative work, discussion, and debate. We will ground our work as a group in tangible solutions that address existing problems in how elections are conducted in the United States. While the emphasis of the class will be on the US context, we will often draw on international case studies as comparative reference points to assist in evaluating possible policy alternatives. While familiarity with the US political system is not a requirement for this class, students should have completed some previous coursework in areas related to law, policy, government, or politics (domestic or international).

HS3032,S28,"McKown, Jamie",Cold War: Early Years,M,"This course provides a broad historical overview of the early years of the “Cold War” period that shaped global politics generally and American foreign policy specifically. Beginning in the 1940’s and leading up to Richard Nixon's election in 1968 we will examine the diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and how this relationship has impacted state actors, economic policies, cultural production, and conceptions of identity. While there will be a heavy focus on traditional state-level diplomatic history, students will also explore a broad array of methodological approaches. Class sessions will include a mix of traditional lecture formats, class discussion, and outside presentations. An evening lab is scheduled in order to screen a variety of cultural artifacts from the various periods we will cover. The primary goal is to give students an intensive 10-week crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.. that defined the early decades of Cold War diplomacy. At the same time there is also time allocated for students to explore their own independent research interests. Given the far-reaching force of Cold War politics into everyday life, individuals with widely varying academic interests will find the course informative and productive.

As such, you cannot be a literature student without encountering Shakespeare; the canon has made sure of that. While those who loved the Empire see Shakespeare as an exemplar of English ideals, anti and post-colonial theorists and artists beg to differ.Therefore, this course will be an introduction to some such theorists and artists. We will read Shakespeare’s plays like Othello, The Tempest, and others from among the following—Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing—with an eye toward postcolonial interpretations, thinking about the issues of race, power, hierarchy, and others. We will also spend some time exploring adaptations of his work that come from Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world, providing new avenues of postcoloniality.You will be evaluated on class participation, short papers, an oral presentation, and a final project.

HS2132,S28,"Tsygankova, Valeria",How Writing Works: Looking Under the Hood,I/M,"So much about writing can feel mystifying when you arrive at college and your writing universe suddenly expands. You might find that the writing “rules” you once learned don’t always apply. A writing strategy you once swore by might stop working. You’ve thought of yourself as a “good writer,” but now that you need to write unfamiliar genres (legal briefs, policy memos, business proposals…), you no longer feel confident. You might experience writer’s block. Picturing writers you admire, who seem to turn out great stories, podcasts, and research articles with ease, you might start to suspect that, after all, you’re a “bad writer.” But what actually happens when expert writers write? How do they become experts? How does anyone progress as a writer? It might feel like the answer to all of these questions is innate genius, or magic, but composition researchers, who study writing, find that development is actually a product of specific practices, dispositions, and acquired knowledge. Many of their findings are counterintuitive and surprising; in one study of undergraduate writers, for instance, those who felt less confident when asked to write in an unfamiliar genre were ultimately more effective than those who felt more confident. (So much for low confidence equating to bad writing). This writing course is an opportunity to get to know the research on writing development, to test out its findings, and to chip away at some disempowering beliefs about writing. Students will experiment with practices that experienced writers use to cope with the complexity and difficulty of writing; they’ll try out strategies that help people write new genres; they’ll get to know themselves better as writers by investigating what works for them and why. In addition to reading the research, students will carry out composition research of their own, adding to our existing body of knowledge and learning transferable research skills that they can draw on in other classes and contexts. Students will be evaluated on this final research project, a shorter metacognition assignment analyzing their own writing processes, and the completion of low-stakes reading and writing assignments that build up to each of these projects. This course welcomes students with no background in rhetoric and composition, as well as students looking to expand on prior knowledge, for instance those who have taken Methods of Tutoring Writing.Level: Introductory./Intermediate Prerequisites: None.

Students will examine letters, diaries, songs, artwork and artifacts, court documents, poems, essays, and fiction primarily by and about women. Students will also consider such questions as: Why and to what extent did women in some parts of the world—China, southern India, Japan, Catalonia—experience relative freedom? What were women’s attitudes toward sexuality, men, children, religion, love, work, magic, and education? How was gender negotiated, with female identity in girlhood, adolescence, and adulthood established or modified, within various sociocultural contexts?

HS2091,S28,"Mahoney, Dan",Forms of Poetry,I/M,"This class is a study of, and a writing workshop in, poetic forms. We will look at constraints, techniques, and directions of contemporary poetry through intensive reading, writing, and criticism of our own poetic work. This background is useful and significant for the study of poetry at any level, and is especially helpful in light of the fact that, for better or worse, free verse techniques have dominated poetry in the twentieth century. This course is valuable for practiced poets, emerging poets, and prose writers alike. Forms of Poetry asks students to pay attention, create poetry of attention, and revel in poetry that is attentive to language; this process will help students develop voice and lyrical content in their own writing. We will look older, “received forms” (Sonnet, Ghazal, Villanelle) and create our own forms by using experimental techniques (homophonic translation, concrete poetry, erasure, nonsense words (i.e. Jabberwocky)) and look to end the term with the amazing Japanese form, Zuihitsu. You might be thinking: Why write with these crazy constraints or in these old timey poetic forms? And what the heck is a Zuihitsu? Those are good questions, questions we will address on a weekly basis. Over the last seventy years, the debates over poetic expression have been shaped in visceral ways, from “raw” versus “cooked,” “academic” versus “beat,” “formal” versus “antiformal.” This class is designed to deepen your knowledge of these debates and to inspire you to draw upon a variety of modes in your own writing. Evaluations: Students will be expected to contribute to a class blog, write several poems a week, revise poetic output, participate in class workshop, and hand sew a chapbook of their own revised, creative work.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques.
