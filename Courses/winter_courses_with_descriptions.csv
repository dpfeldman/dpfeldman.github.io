"Clinger, Catherine",Demons from the Depths,HY,Intermediate/Advanced,"Across a range of epochs, cultures, and territories, human beings have proffered myths, stories, and scientific theories in order to explain catastrophic natural events. From kata=down, strephein=turn, the Greek katastrephein meant ""under-turning"" in the ancient world. This course explores postulations regarding large- and small-scale calamitous events that seem to originate from below the surface of Earth. Our enquiry engages with legendary tales, historical records, material culture and scientific discourses that document attempts to explain the meaning and/or mechanism of such memorable episodes. What causes a mountain to eject ash and toxic gases? What infernal force creates lava flow? Why does the earth shake? Why do some natural waters cause harm? How do we understand that which we cannot see? Through case-studies informed by the literature of science, the arts and humanities, we will plumb the depths and limits of the human imagination. This class uses both a lecture-based and seminar-style discussion approach as well as time spent visiting local lab and field sites. Students will be evaluated based on their weekly activities and writing assignments, and a final project with both oral and written presentation components.","NOTE: a prerequisite is that you have taken a college-level course in either: Geoscience, Art History, History, or Literature."

"Clinger, Catherine",Advanced Studio Printmaking,ADS,Advanced,"This art studio course is a continuation of the introductory course Studio Printmaking. A print mirrors the surface of its matrix and presents a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This advanced studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking by experimenting with conventional and non-traditional ways of creating a range of matrices. Students will acquire skills as printmakers with an emphasis on multiple-plate, collagraph, and other advanced techniques. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper – engaging with more complex discourses of representation. Students will be evaluated on their projects, participation in critiques, level of engagement with materials, ability to work in a collaborative studio, and final project. Level: Advanced.",
"Ialeggio, Anna",Sci-Fi & Sculpture: World-Building as Art Practice,ADS,Introductory,"What do science fiction and sculptural installations have in common? The manifestation of momentary, immersive, and provocative new worlds! In this hybrid studio/seminar class, we will move between readings of ecologically-themed science fiction, environmental nonfiction, poetry, and theory, alongside the practice of making together in real time and place. Several short, open-ended individual prompts will lead us gradually towards a large-scale, immersive installation at the end of the term—the theme, location and manifestation of which we will develop as a collective. Sculptural materials that we’ll work with together will include textiles, paper mache, and cardboard. In addition, students will be investigating and sharing techniques to bring to the class throughout the term. Readings may include but are not limited to: Ursula K Le Guin, Hakim Bey, N.K. Jemisen, Octavia Butler, Kim Stanley Robinson, Cixin Liu, Barry Lopez, Tracy Rosenthal, Anna Tsing, Jakob Von Uexküll, and Donna Haraway. World-building visual artists that we’ll look to may include but are not limited to: Adrián Villar Rojas, Cecilia Vicuña, Jennifer Moon, Cannupa Hanska Luger, Candace Lin, Mel Chin, Agnes Denis, and Joan Jonas. Depending on the season, we may make site visits relating to our developing themes. Evaluation will be based on participation in class activities (exercises, presentations, readings, discussions, occasional writing and/or drawing prompts), significant studio time outside of class, timely completion of all projects with corresponding group critique sessions, and contributions towards a collective practice. A sketchbook is required.",
"Ialeggio, Anna",Advanced Ceramic Sculpture,ADS,Intermediate/Advanced,"This is a ceramics course for intermediate or advanced practitioners and requires foundational skills in hand building and/or wheel-throwing. It is designed to support students’ continued development of unique spatial and material languages grounded in the possibilities and limitations of clay. A series of technical demonstrations and open-ended conceptual prompts will initiate creative problem-solving in advanced modes of clay construction including but not limited to alternative kiln firing, glaze chemistry, and mold-making. Each student will inform and express their studio work through sustained independent research, and the collective skillsets, interests, and ambitions of the class as a whole will shape the arc of the course. Through presentations and readings, we’ll explore a selection of global, historical, and contemporary ideas and practices with direct bearing on our work as it develops. We will make at least one visit to an exhibition or site relevant to our pursuits and welcome at least one visiting artist into our studio; as always, we’ll share the joy and responsibility of running a communal studio. Evaluation will be based on participation in class activities (hands-on exercises, presentations, readings, discussions, and occasional writing and/or drawing prompts), significant studio time outside of class, timely completion of all projects with corresponding group critique sessions, and consistent involvement with studio maintenance. A sketchbook is encouraged.",
"Feldman, David",Differential Equations,ES QR,Intermediate,"Differential equations are an application of calculus used to model a wide variety of physical and natural phenomena. The rate at which a cup of coffee cools, populations of predators and prey in ecosystems, the spread of disease, and the behavior of electric circuits, are all examples of systems that have been described with differential equations. This course is an introduction to ordinary differential equations, intended for students who have completed a single-variable calculus course. The course covers a variety of techniques for solving and understanding differential equations, including numerical and qualitative solution methods. Students will learn to solve and analyze differential equations using the python programming language. Students will also gain experience formulating mathematical models using differential equations. To do so, we will discuss general modeling principles and also consider several case studies. In addition to learning the mathematics of differential equations, a central goal of this course is to gain skills necessary for research in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences. This includes conceptualizing and framing a research question, conducing a literature review, giving a research presentation, and writing up results in a style appropriate for publication. Evaluation will be based on class participation, bi-weekly problem sets, and a term-long project culminating in a presentation and short research paper. Some computer work will be required, but no computer experience is necessary.","<p>Differential Equations (DiffEQ) is an application of calculus that finds wide application across the physics, natural, and social sciences. This class covers differential equations from a very applied perspective. We focus on what differential equations <i>are</i>: what they mean and how they're used. We don't concentrate on analytic (by-hand) calculus-heavy techniques for solving DiffEQ. Rather, we will make heavy and unapologetic use of computation to solve for, analyze, and visualize solutions. Specifically we will use python and the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib packages---tools that are commonly used across the sciences.</p><p>To take this class, it's important that you've seen differential calculus before and, at least at some point in your life, had an ok conceptual understanding of derivatives. It's fine if you've forgotten some differentiation rules, or if you're pretty shaky on integrals. No computer experience is necessary, although some would certainly be helpful.</p><p>We focus on applications of DiffEQ from population ecology and epidemiology. But we will also touch on applications from physics, engineering, and the social sciences depending on student interests.</p><p>This class is centered on a term-long research project. As part of this, we'll talk about how to search for and read scientific papers, what research is, and how to pose a compelling research question. Many projects center around reproducing a result from a recent peer-reviewed papers. Students have broad latitude to chose research topics, and thus are usually able to customize this class to align with their interests.</p><p>If you have questions about this course or are unsure if you have the background to take it, please reach out to me (Dave).</p>"
"Hall, Sarah",Geology of National Parks,ES,Introductory,"In this introductory geoscience course students will learn foundational principles and concepts such as plate tectonics, geologic time, climate and weather, rocks and minerals, and surface processes through an exploration of some of the National Parks of the United States. Through virtual field trips of various parks, students will visualize how regional climate and surface processes such as rivers, glaciers, and wind interact with the bedrock and surficial materials to produce some of the most iconic landscapes. While Acadia National Park offers a view of an ancient and eroded supervolcano, Yellowstone offers a glimpse of a dynamic landscape built on a modern supervolcano. While a few glaciers still cling to the high peaks of Glacier National Park, Yosemite hosts steep glacially carved valleys and polished domes reminiscent of a glaciated past. Class time will be used for lectures, discussions of readings, and laboratory exercises. During labs, students will get to know approximately 6 different parks in detail through interaction with geologic maps, rock samples, aerial imagery, and scientific reports. The students will be evaluated based on laboratory exercises and a final project through which students will explore one park of their choosing.",
"Letcher, Susan",Plants and People: Economic Botany,ES,Introductory,"This class offers an introduction to plant biology centered around plants that are useful to human societies. We will explore plant anatomy, physiology, evolution, and ecology through case studies involving plants that are useful to humans. Through lectures, readings, and discussions, students will gain a rich understanding of how plants function and how human societies depend on them in myriad ways. We will cover universal and familiar uses of plants such as food, building materials, and textiles, as well as less widely practiced uses including arrow poisons, lacquers, and living fences. We will discuss the origins of agriculture and methods of plant breeding, as well as the biogeographical history of important cultivated plant lineages. The focus will be on plants and our uses for them, but we will also discuss ethical concerns surrounding practices like bioprospecting and ex situ conservation. Students will be evaluated on participation and the successful completion of two presentations and a research paper.",
"Slabach, Brittany",Collecting Nature: Exploration of Scientific Collection,ES,Introductory,"Natural history collections are important artifacts that provide pivotal information on the past, present, and future of our natural world. They document species ecology and distribution, changes in aspects of phenotypes, and aid in conservation initiatives. Collections have tremendous value in understanding and documenting our natural and cultural world. Yet their history, and the practice of scientific collecting, is muddled with bias, controversy, and colonial practices. Through discussion and practice, we will explore the science and art of scientific collecting, preparing, and caring for specimens (plant and animal). We will discuss the history of scientific collections, and collection practices, and consider their role and value. We will visit natural history museums, their collections, and the curators that care for them. Thus, there are two required field trips, including one overnight. We will also practice the art of specimen preparation and care, learning different preparation and cataloging techniques. This class is open to anyone with any interest or curiosity about natural history museums, collections or scientific collecting. It is recommended for students interested in museology techniques or those interested in pursuing careers in museum studies. Assessments include written responses to weekly prompts, discussion participation, written essays, and a term project.","<p>This is a museum and natural history collection focused class. We discuss the history of scientific collections, and collection practices, and consider their role and value. We read old field journals, essays, peer-review literature, and popular articles. We read, alot. We visit natural history museums, their collections, and the curators that care for them. We have several field trips throughout the term, including a required two-night overnight to Boston. Finally, we practice the art of specimen preparation and care, learning different preparation and cataloging techniques. This includes working directly with our Dorr Museum of Natural History and the Herbarium. Students are required to complete at least ten hours of curatorial work outside of class.</p> <p>I have attached last year's syllabus to assist with understanding the objectives of the course and the assessments (a few may change this winter). The schedule will not be the same this year, but I hope this provides information that is helpful. The class enrollment is capped due to the limitations of the number of individuals allowed in some collections we visit. While this class is open to anyone with any interest or curiosity about natural history museums or scientific collecting, it is recommended for students interested in museology techniques or those interested in pursuing careers in museum studies, and it is particularly aimed at first and second year students to allow them to build on these experiences.</p><p><br><b><a href=""./scientific_collection_syllabus.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Link to Syllabus</a></b></br></p>"
"Todd, Sean",Introduction to Statistics and Research Design,QR,Introductory/Intermediate,"This course introduces the basics of statistical analysis that can be used in either a scientific or a social science frame of reference. While this course teaches you to perform both nonparametric and simple parametric analysis both by hand and computer, an emphasis will be placed on understanding the principles and assumptions of each test, rather than mathematical ability per se. We will also learn how to report statistical results in journal format, and there will be plenty of lab time to sharpen skills. Evaluation is based on lab participation, three quizzes, and a team project.",<p>This course is offered every year.</p>Note: This course is a prerequisite for <i>Biostatistics</i>. 
"Fuller, Linda",Teaching as an Act of Hope,HS ED,Introductory,"In a world marked by complexity, uncertainty, and diverse challenges, the role of teachers extends far beyond the transmission of knowledge. Students in this course will explore the question of what helps certain teachers to bring a continual sense of hope to their professional practice despite often relatively low pay, long hours, negative attention during political clashes, and increasing stressors on youth and society that inevitably appear in the classroom. Why do people choose to teach? And what keeps them in the classroom? How do teachers experience the impact of various education-focused policies on their efforts, and what are some ways teachers navigate and influence policy to maintain their visions for successful schools? Through critical readings, podcasts, guest speakers, small group interviews, and classroom observations students will reflect on how teachers bring and maintain hope in their learning communities. Students can expect to speak with area teachers as well as education experts from a variety of realms, and texts will include choices from authors such as Patrick Harris II, bell hooks, John Dewey, Regie Routman, Parker Palmer, and Nel Noddings. Final projects will allow students to creatively share their learning with one another and with teachers whose ideas have been most influential in their growing understanding of this realm of world-changing efforts. This course is suitable for future teachers or those considering teaching as well as education enthusiasts and anyone interested in the profound impact of education on society.",
"Hill, Kenneth",Introduction to Adolescent Psychology,HS ED,Introductory,"This course focuses on the segment of the human life span from puberty to early adulthood. In this class we will examine the physical, cognitive, social, and moral aspects of adolescent growth and development. Issues to be considered include adolescent relationships (peers, family, romantic), adolescent issues (identity formation, at risk behavior, schooling, and stereotypes), and critical reflection on one's own adolescent experience. The main objectives of this course are to: 1) provide students with a working knowledge of the theories of psychology which pertain to early adolescent development; 2) help students develop the ability to critically analyze information and common assumptions about the development of adolescents; 3) consider contemporary issues and concerns of the field; and 4) to afford students the opportunity to explore their own adolescent development. Course work entails lecture, discussion, extensive case analysis, and a field component.",
"Cline, Ken",Native American Law,HS,Intermediate,"From first contact through the confrontation surrounding the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Dakota Access Pipeline, Native American law has tried to reconcile two incommensurate legal systems and widely varying government policies. This course examines the evolution of federal Native American or ""Indian"" Law from colonization onward as impacted by treaties, executive orders, congressional enactments, and major U.S. Supreme Court cases interpreting the U.S. Constitution and statutes as they involve Native American legal issues. This is not a class about tribal law or the indigenous legal systems that exist among the various tribes in the US. Rather, it examines the legal system imposed on tribes from the outside; a system that has evolved over time and creates the legal framework which tribes operate under today. Students will gain an understanding of law as a policy tool and framework, and acquire the necessary skills to work on policy issues affecting native peoples. We will focus on primary legal material as well as secondary interpretations of that material. There will be some comparative law analysis from other countries and an examination of how the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples relates to US practices. Students will complete several analytical problem sets that require an application of course concepts to fact scenarios as well as a major paper on a legal topic of their choosing. A class visit to a Maine reservation will allow conversation with tribal leaders involved with current environmental and Native American issues in Maine.",
"Cline, Ken","Our Public Lands:  Past, Present, and Future",HS HY,Intermediate,"By definition ""public lands"" belong to all of us, yet public lands in this country have a history of use (and abuse) by special interests and a shocking absence of any coherent management strategy for long-term sustainability. This course is taught in seminar format in which students read and discuss several environmental policy and history texts that concern the history and future of our federal lands. We also use primary historic documents and texts to understand the origins of public ownership and management. We examine the legal, philosophical, ecological, and political problems that have faced our National Parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands. An effort is made to sort out the tangle of laws and conflicting policies that govern these public resources. Special attention is given to the historic roots of current policy debates. Evaluation is based upon response papers, a class presentation, participation in class discussions, and a group project looking closely at the historical context and policy implications of a management issue facing a nearby public land unit.",
"Collum, Kourtney",Transforming Food Systems,HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"This course explores possibilities for transformative change across local and global food systems. The course centers on the questions: What would it take to ensure access to healthy, safe, affordable, culturally appropriate foods for all people? The first part of the course critically examines capitalist food systems with particular attention to the ways culture, politics, and economics shape our interactions with food. Through readings and exercises, we explore issues such as nutrition, worker safety, contested agricultural and land use policies, hunger, and environmental and community health. The second part of the course examines case studies of transformative food movements around the world, from the Zero Hunger programs in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to La Via Campesina global campaign for agrarian reform. We focus particularly on food sovereignty and agroecology movements. The final third of the course focuses on transformative work in Maine and at COA. Students take multiple field trips to participate in local movements and to learn about their philosophies, objectives, and activities. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze how power shapes food systems and articulate a theory of change for addressing a food systems problem of their choice. Students are evaluated based on participation in class discussions and field trips, a series of reflection papers, and a final project including a paper and an audio-visual presentation.",
"Cox, Gray",Political Economy of Artificial Intelligence,HS,Introductory,"We live in a time when ever more pervasive forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming our world. From quotidian applications such as generating audio-visual contents and responding to human’s queries to more intangible applications such as restructuring the labor market, speeding up extractive economic growth, and empowering surveillance and oppression on a mass scale, the potentials unleashed by AI are ready to upend our world. How are the shifts toward digital forms of production and exchange challenging the “laws” of supply and demand and other t political economic processes? How will the digitalization of nature intensify and transform the ways in which the commodification of nature has altered ecological systems? What will happen when AI saturates our political and economic life while it simultaneously depletes the planet? How will AI shape our understanding of ourselves and our societies? How do we, individually and collectively, grapple with ethical and existential issues that AI proliferation has raised and will continue to raise? Is it all too late, or is it merely a beginning? In this course students will approach these questions through the lens of political economy, which focuses on how the quest for power and profit has shaped the development and deployment of AI, and how AI applications, in turns, are disrupting and transforming our society and our planet. The course will draw on traditional methods of Political Economic analysis and tools from Futures Studies such as scenario building and the Delphi Method. Topics addressed may include, for instance: challenges in aligning AI systems with human values; open source vs. proprietary models of digital property; the implications of AI and other forms of digital powers for democracy, nation states, and global governance; transformations in labor markets and class structures; and debates over transhumanism and competing visions of technological futures. Our selection of key texts may include Gray Cox’s Smarter Planet or Wise Earth, Kate Crawford’s Atlas of AI, and Nick Dyer-Witherford et al. ‘s Inhuman Power. The course is valuable for any students who want to investigate the development trajectory of AI and its predecessors, to engage critically with the impacts and contradictions of AI implementation, and to cultivate a creative imagination about the future of life and work when AI becomes ubiquitous. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed the abilities to: 1.) understand and explain key features of the emerging forms of AI and related technologies and their impacts on human ecological systems; 2.) use theoretical analyses and empirical evidence to critically engage with conflicting discourses from various political economic traditions regarding AI-related technologies; 3.) envision competing scenarios of the future with AI and critically analyze the conceptual and practical insights which they may offer. Students will be evaluated through a combination of reading responses, in-class participation, short papers, and a final symposium in which students will present and debate their visions for the future political economy of AI and/or how AI will transform political economic systems around the world.","This course is valuable for any students who want to investigate the development trajectory of AI and its predecessors, to engage critically with the impacts and contradictions of AI implementation, and to cultivate a creative imagination about the future of life and work when AI might become ubiquitous.

"Khor, Su Yin","Entry Point: Identity, Language, and Power ",W HS,Intermediate,"It’s through language that we construct our identities in everyday, professional, and academic contexts. We use language to make sense of our experiences and our ever-changing identities, whether these are national, social, local and/or global identities. Languages, cultures, and identities are intimately connected, but not all languages or people are treated as equal. So-called standard varieties of language are dominant in the media, entertainment, official documents, and education. In contrast, speakers of perceived non-standard varieties have been excluded and marginalized in different ways. Language can be used to exercise power over others on the basis of perceived linguistic divergence. While language and discourse are embedded in social issues, they remain invisible and are often absent from discussions about social issues. Using identity as the entry point to understand human experiences, this class examines how identity intersects with linguistic diversity, cultural practices, the creation and maintenance of social hierarchies, and asymmetrical power relations in everyday, professional, and educational settings. How do ideas about language maintain and perpetuate stereotypes and social hierarchies? Where do language standards come from? Do only foreigners have accents? We will use readings from applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, migration studies, rhetoric and composition and other related areas to examine these questions and many more. The projects for the course will explore various aspects of identity and its connection to linguistic diversity and social issues through readings, interviews, and spoken/written narratives, which will be used to produce a podcast. Through genre and rhetorical analysis activities, we will explore different genres and podcasts to develop an understanding of writing and how people construct identities through discursive choices and multimodal elements. These activities will develop your understanding of connections between genre conventions and rhetorical situations and support your overall development of writing, in particular metacognitive and metalinguistic abilities. In addition to these skills, you will learn technical skills to produce an audio piece to tell your and other people’s (counter)stories to challenge dominant narratives about language, linguistic diversity, and identities. The audio production skills you will learn include recording, importing, mixing, editing, mastering, and exporting sound. You will be assessed based on participation in small and whole group activities, reading responses, literacy narratives, reflections, engagement with course materials, peer-review workshops, participation during a series of audio-production exercises, preparation for and completion of recordings, and the production of a short podcast episode incorporating all of the skills learned throughout the term. Please note that the course content is similar to College Seminar: “Soda, Pop, or Coke?”: Linguistic Diversity and Research for Change: Writing, Language, Social (In)justice, thus, this course is recommended for those who haven’t taken the previous courses as the content is similar.","<p>Using identity as the entry point to understand human experiences, we will examine how identity intersects with linguistic diversity, social issues, the creation and maintenance of social hierarchies, and asymmetrical power relations in everyday, professional, and educational settings.

"Soares, Zachary","Entry Point: Identity, Language, and Power ",W HS,Intermediate,"It’s through language that we construct our identities in everyday, professional, and academic contexts. We use language to make sense of our experiences and our ever-changing identities, whether these are national, social, local and/or global identities. Languages, cultures, and identities are intimately connected, but not all languages or people are treated as equal. So-called standard varieties of language are dominant in the media, entertainment, official documents, and education. In contrast, speakers of perceived non-standard varieties have been excluded and marginalized in different ways. Language can be used to exercise power over others on the basis of perceived linguistic divergence. While language and discourse are embedded in social issues, they remain invisible and are often absent from discussions about social issues. Using identity as the entry point to understand human experiences, this class examines how identity intersects with linguistic diversity, cultural practices, the creation and maintenance of social hierarchies, and asymmetrical power relations in everyday, professional, and educational settings. How do ideas about language maintain and perpetuate stereotypes and social hierarchies? Where do language standards come from? Do only foreigners have accents? We will use readings from applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, migration studies, rhetoric and composition and other related areas to examine these questions and many more. The projects for the course will explore various aspects of identity and its connection to linguistic diversity and social issues through readings, interviews, and spoken/written narratives, which will be used to produce a podcast. Through genre and rhetorical analysis activities, we will explore different genres and podcasts to develop an understanding of writing and how people construct identities through discursive choices and multimodal elements. These activities will develop your understanding of connections between genre conventions and rhetorical situations and support your overall development of writing, in particular metacognitive and metalinguistic abilities. In addition to these skills, you will learn technical skills to produce an audio piece to tell your and other people’s (counter)stories to challenge dominant narratives about language, linguistic diversity, and identities. The audio production skills you will learn include recording, importing, mixing, editing, mastering, and exporting sound. You will be assessed based on participation in small and whole group activities, reading responses, literacy narratives, reflections, engagement with course materials, peer-review workshops, participation during a series of audio-production exercises, preparation for and completion of recordings, and the production of a short podcast episode incorporating all of the skills learned throughout the term. Please note that the course content is similar to College Seminar: “Soda, Pop, or Coke?”: Linguistic Diversity and Research for Change: Writing, Language, Social (In)justice, thus, this course is recommended for those who haven’t taken the previous courses as the content is similar.","<p>Using identity as the entry point to understand human experiences, we will examine how identity intersects with linguistic diversity, social issues, the creation and maintenance of social hierarchies, and asymmetrical power relations in everyday, professional, and educational settings.

"Lakey, Heather",Philosophies of Good and Evil,HS,Introductory,"Good and evil are timeless topics and they have motivated centuries of philosophical thinking. Although the terms “good” and “evil” are commonly used across a range of discourses, they are ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In an effort to explore different ideas about good and evil, this course provides a broad overview of the issues, arguments, and debates that shape philosophical ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What are the origins of good and evil? What makes an action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What should we do with someone who commits a horrific act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? What kinds of ethical theories operate without the concepts of good and evil? Is evil an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of good and evil help or hinder moral thinking? To critically unpack these questions, we will read works by ethical thinkers including Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, Hannah Arendt, Zhuangzi, Simone de Beauvoir, Abû Nasr al-Fârâbî, Nell Noddings, Peter Singer, Kwame Gyekye, Mencius, Sherman Alexie, and others. Along the way, we will study deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, ethical relativism, feminist ethics, Taoism, and existential ethics. In addition, we will unpack the ethical arguments that orbit concrete topics such as execution, murder, moral character, racial injustice, and our ethical duties to one another. This course will familiarize students with the influential frameworks of ethical philosophy, and it will encourage students to apply these frameworks to specific ethical problems. Course requirements include class participation, three short papers, a reflection essay, and a final paper or project. There are no prerequisites for this course, but students should be prepared to engage with difficult, philosophical texts and to discuss these texts in class.",
"Lakey, Heather",Animals and Ethics,HS,Introductory,"What are our moral obligations to other animals? Should non-human animals have legal rights and moral standing? If so, on what basis? How does the moral treatment of animals change across the contexts of food, research, captivity, and the home? Historically, western philosophers construct the animal in opposition to the human. Why? What is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted with it? How does language shape and produce our relationships with animals? How is the animal represented and characterized, and how does this representation impact our thinking about animal ethics? This discussion-based course explores the relationships between humans and non-human animals. Drawing on fiction, philosophy, and ethology, we will examine our beliefs and assumptions regarding animals, human-animal relations, and the ethical implications of the human-animal binary. This course will focus on a wide range of theoretical approaches, including the traditions of animal liberation and animal rights as articulated by thinkers such as Tom Regan and Peter Singer, the growing field of animal studies as represented by thinkers like Jacques Derrida, and current debates in practical ethics, such as animal experimentation, hunting, and invasive species. Upon completion of the course, students will have refined their understanding of the concept of the animal and they will be familiar with the key legal and ethical debates regarding human-animal relationships. Course requirements include class discussions, weekly writing exercises, a midterm exam, and a final paper or project. Students should come to this class prepared to read challenging philosophical essays and to share their ideas with others.",
"Little-Siebold, Todd",Environmental History,HS HY,Introductory,"How has human history shaped and been shaped by ""the environment""? Environmental history is one of the most exciting new fields in history. In this course we examine world history from Mesopotamia to the present to see the role such things as resource scarcity, mythology, philosophy, imperialism, land policy, theology, plagues, scientific revolutions, the discovery of the new world, the industrial revolution, etc. on the natural, social, and built environments.",
"Little-Siebold, Todd",Histories of Race,HS HY,Intermediate/Advanced,"Race as a concept was constructed in the western world in the early modern era as commentary on and explanation of human differences. This class will examine the origins of the idea of race and the ways it is central to the creation of the modern world. Drawing on histories of Europe and the Americas this class will look at the different ways racialized thinking was deployed in colonial contexts. Central themes of the course will be the history of race as an idea, the nature and impact of the Atlantic slave trade, how indigenous peoples reshaped European ideas of what it meant to be human, the construction of whiteness, and the history of slavery in the new world. The period covered by the class spans from the origins of race as an idea to the late nineteenth century. The course will be a hybrid of a lecture course and a readings seminar. Students will read major works in the field and develop an understanding of the historical background of contemporary forms of structural inequality justified and reinforced by racialized thinking. Students will do a series of short assignments, lead discussion of books, and undertake a major research paper. The research projects will allow students to explore topics beyond the chronological and spatial scope of the course.",
"Longsworth, Gordon",Geographic Information Systems I: Foundations & Applications,HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.",
"Nguyen, Duc Hien",Introduction to Macroeconomics,HS QR,Introductory,"This course provides an introductory lens to understand the economy as a whole – the macroeconomy – and how its various parts interact. We will study topics such as (i) the short-term fluctuation of the general price level, employment level, and total output level, (ii) the linkages between structural unemployment, economic inequality, and government policies, and (iii) the long-term trajectory of economic growth and the unevenness of capitalist development. Some of the key questions we will explore include: How do we measure the macroeconomy, and what do our conventional measurements often leave out? Why do cyclical economic booms and busts exist and what drives them? What can governments do to limit the costs of job loss on workers? Looking globally, why are some countries rich and other countries poor? How have global living standards improved over the long run, and at what cost to humans, non-human beings, and the environment? This course aims to increase your ability to use abstract, quantitative models to describe and articulate the various ways in which macroeconomic factors frame the condition of possibilities for people, their families, and their communities. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and politically about public policies and debates. You will also expand your capacity for numerical literacy and quantitative skills such as drawing valid conclusions based on data and communicating your reasoning and results effectively and clearly. The course is especially valuable for students with interests in civic engagement, social justices, political transformation, and sustainable development. Previous knowledge in economics, calculus, statistics, and linear algebra is not necessary. Familiarity with elementary algebra will be helpful but not required. Students’ learning will be assessed through problem sets, and take-home exams.","This course is an introduction to how economists model the economy as a whole - the macroeconomy - and how its various parts interact. It is valuable to students with interest in advanced economic topics, global civic engagement, social justices, global food system, political transformation, or sustainable development. No prerequisite. Topics include: measuring GDP, unemployment, inflation, economic growth and depression, business cycles, exchange rate and interest rate, fiscal and monetary policies."
"Stabinsky, Doreen",Climate Justice,HS,Introductory,"Climate change is one of the biggest and most difficult challenges faced by contemporary societies. The challenge has multiple facets: environmental, social, political, economic – each with its own complexities. This course focuses primarily on the social, political and economic components of the climate problem, framed by the concept of climate justice. In the course students are introduced to basic conceptions of justice, the latest findings of climate science and possible impacts on regional scales, and the global politics of climate change, principally in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Climate justice and its operationalization is the principal organizing theme for work over the term, addressing questions such as: how the costs of climate change impacts and efforts to address climate change could or should be distributed between rich and poor, global north and global south; and what are the possible means whereby those costs might be addressed through collective action at various levels: local, national, and global. Students will be evaluated based on regular quizzes, several short papers, class participation, and a final synthetic paper or project.",
"Taneja, Palak",Midnight's Children,HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"“Only by unleashing the fictionality of fiction, the imaginativeness of the imagination, the dream songs of our dreams, can we hope to approach the new, and to create fiction that may, once again, be more interesting than the facts."" -Salman Rushdie, “Ask Yourself"". Nobody exemplifies these notions better than Rushdie himself. Therefore, this course will be an exploration of the fantastical world of Salman Rushdie through his seminal novel Midnight’s Children. Deemed as one of the Great Books of the 20th century, which won the Booker prize the year of its publication, 1981, and the Booker of Bookers twice over (in 1993 and 2008), the novel is a prime example of postcolonialism with a magical realist twist. In this class, we will take a deep dive into Rushdie’s novel by paying close attention to the prose and his style and the history and contexts that he sets up in this novel. Therefore, the reading of the novel will be supplemented with historical background and literary criticism that bring up questions of utopia, nation, politics, identity, and subalternity, to name a few. You will be evaluated on class participation and written assignments like discussion posts, an oral presentation, a paper, and a final project.","<p>I am teaching this course after quite a few years, but it remains one of my favorites. Here's the description:</p><p>At the stroke of midnight, a nation is born—and with it children whose lives are surrounded in mystery. Booker prize-winning (and later the Booker of Bookers) Midnight's Children is a novel by Salman Rushdie that follows the stories of a few children born at midnight on the 15th of August 1947, the day India gained its independence from the British Empire. In this class, we will dedicate our entire 10-week term to engaging closely with this one novel—a rare opportunity at COA! We will explore the novel’s postcolonial context—its relationship to the Partition of India and Pakistan, its reimagining of national history, and its challenge to the boundaries between the personal and the political. Along with the main text, we’ll engage with a few key critical essays that highlight the novel’s style, symbolism, and significance. </p><p><b>This class might be of interest to you if you are a fan of magical realism, historical fiction, or just exploring the power of literature.</b> Salman Rushdie is also the author of other works such as The Satanic Verses, Shame, and Haroun and the Sea of Stories—you may also know Rushdie for having recently survived a stabbing in 2022 due to the controversies surrounding his novel The Satanic Verses.</p><p>Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions about it.</p>"
"Tsygankova, Valeria ",How Writing Works: Looking Under the Hood,W HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"So much about writing can feel mystifying when you arrive at college and your writing universe suddenly expands. You might find that the writing “rules” you once learned don’t always apply. A writing strategy you once swore by might stop working. You’ve thought of yourself as a “good writer,” but now that you need to write unfamiliar genres (legal briefs, policy memos, business proposals…), you no longer feel confident. You might experience writer’s block. Picturing writers you admire, who seem to turn out great stories, podcasts, and research articles with ease, you might start to suspect that, after all, you’re a “bad writer.” But what actually happens when expert writers write? How do they become experts? How does anyone progress as a writer? It might feel like the answer to all of these questions is innate genius, or magic, but composition researchers, who study writing, find that development is actually a product of specific practices, dispositions, and acquired knowledge. Many of their findings are counterintuitive and surprising; in one study of undergraduate writers, for instance, those who felt less confident when asked to write in an unfamiliar genre were ultimately more effective than those who felt more confident. (So much for low confidence equating to bad writing). This writing course is an opportunity to get to know the research on writing development, to test out its findings, and to chip away at some disempowering beliefs about writing. Students will experiment with practices that experienced writers use to cope with the complexity and difficulty of writing; they’ll try out strategies that help people write new genres; they’ll get to know themselves better as writers by investigating what works for them and why. In addition to reading the research, students will carry out composition research of their own, adding to our existing body of knowledge and learning transferable research skills that they can draw on in other classes and contexts. Students will be evaluated on this final research project, a shorter metacognition assignment analyzing their own writing processes, and the completion of low-stakes reading and writing assignments that build up to each of these projects. This course welcomes students with no background in rhetoric and composition, as well as students looking to expand on prior knowledge, for instance those who have taken Methods of Tutoring Writing.","<p>What actually happens when expert writers write?

"van Vliet, Netta","Colonialism, Nationalism, and the Nation-State ",HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"This course is an introduction to concepts and practices of nationalism, the modern nation-state, and questions about postcolonial contexts and concepts. Over the term we will draw on the disciplines of anthropology, literature, history, philosophy, and on the interdisciplinary fields of psychoanalysis, postcolonial and feminist studies to think critically about the relations between group and individual, between governments and corporations, as well as about citizenship, sovereignty, border control, migration, repression, genocidal violence, patriotism, belonging and exclusion. The course will begin with key points of historical reference such as the Peace of Westphalia and the French, US, and Haitian Revolutions. We will then proceed to focus on examples of nationalist projects in 19th, 20th, and 21st century Europe, as well as on nationalist and postcolonial movements in the Americas, Africa, and Western Asia. Students will be asked to consider course materials in relation to contemporary discussions about asylum, racism, sexism, capitalism and poverty, political economy, freedom of speech, academic and artistic freedom, genocide, human rights, and political violence. Course materials will likely include work by Nadia Abu El-Haj, Benedict Anderson, Hannah Arendt, Aime Césaire, Jacques Derrida, Sigmund Freud, Eric Hobsbawm, Ranjana Khanna, Deborah Thomas, Carol Pateman, Jacques Rousseau, Edward Said, Carl Schmitt, Gayatri Spivak, and Françoise Vergès.

"Jacoby, Franklin",Our Life with Words: Philosophies of Language,HS,Introductory/Intermediate,"What is language? What is the relationship between language and thought? Between language and experience? What is meaning? These are some of the central questions of the philosophy of language. They are fundamental not only to large portions to modern philosophy, but also linguistics, computer science and other fields. This course will explore some of the key theories and criticisms that philosophers have developed in answer to these questions about our life with words. In this course, we will take a historical approach and work our way to the present, exploring classic theories of meaning and language from the early modern period and early analytic philosophers, such as Mill, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and others. Then we will examine criticisms that philosophers have raised over the years, both from texts in the analytic tradition as well as other positions from, for example, ordinary language philosophy, continental approaches. Students will acquire an understanding of those central problems in the philosophy of language; they will also develop philosophical skills in analysing texts, articulating arguments, and presenting complex philosophical material through writing and oral presentations.",

This intensive process will result in a run of public performances near the end of the term. The course counts for three full credits and requires a significant time commitment. The class meets most weekdays, for extended hours, and those enrolled must be available for a certain amount of additional collaborative work (extra rehearsals, construction and tech work, plus final performance dates and strike). A production schedule will be available by the first week of the term the course is offered. Evaluation is based on demonstrated commitment to the process and a final reflective paper based on the experience. Because the material and pedagogical focus of the course changes with each successive rendition, students may receive credit for this course more than once. Default grading for this course is Credit/No Credit.","<p>Jodi Baker and Jonathan Henderson and I will be offering a 3-credit music theater production course this Winter term.  This iteration of the course will be focused on staging a production of Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century.

Dedicated class meeting blocks this winter are M, T, R, F 9-4 and W 2:35 - 4. All company members will not be called during all these hours. We’ll create a reasonable production schedule draft over winter break and make that schedule available before the course starts. Also, we may not be in the same location each day – some days/hours may be spent learning lines and music, building, shopping, sewing, printing, etc. This said, you should plan on committing to all these hours in various ways throughout the term. There may also be extended hours during tech week – late week 8, early week 9.</p><p>Public performances are tentatively scheduled for the end of week nine, with strike/load-out and debrief during week ten. </p>"
"Lepcio, Andrea",10X Dramatic Writing Studio,AD,Introductory/Intermediate,"This class is an invitation to explore writing for theater, film, and television by creating ten scripts over the 10-week term. Edward Albee told Andrea that a play is as long as it is. To that end, like a short story, the short form allows for the creation of numerous stories, testing of form and structure, experimentation, failure, and success. Scripts can range from 1 page to 10 pages or longer if need be. This writing workshop will be fast-paced and inquiry-driven. We will use class time to do writing exercises, ask and answer questions, discuss the craft of scriptwriting, and share and critique our own and one another’s work. Students will be expected to create ten scripts, re-draft 5 of those scripts, and select their favorite script to further refine and finalize as their final project. Evaluation is based on the quality of written work and participation in class discussions. Work will be evaluated for quality, engagement, effectiveness, on-time delivery, and commitment to the workshop collective. Students are expected to bring in new plays each week and to contribute their best work to an end-of-class public reading.",

"Waldron, Karen",The Nature of Narrative II,HS,Advanced,"This is an advanced course in which students practice the human ecology of literary analysis. We explore the ""mind"" or consciousness of twentieth and twenty-first-century fictional writing (specifically, novels) by looking at how narratives make meaning, and at how we make meaning from narratives. The course accomplishes this by surveying some of the best and most challenging works of modern fiction, with a particular focus on those novels that highlight narrative technique, stretch the boundaries of the imagination, have a rich and deep texture, and push against the limitations of prose fictional textuality. Students will hone their reading and analytic skills by working closely with texts that broke new literary ground. Authors will include several of the following: Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, Djuna Barnes, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Toni Morrison, Manuel Puig, Italo Calvino, Clarice Lispector, Ishmael Reed, Hélène Cixous, Gerald Vizenor, Jeanette Winterson, Julio Cortazar, as well as others. We will also study some narrative and novel theory.

"Ferrari , Melissa ",Devices of Wonder: Moving Pictures,ADS,Intermediate/Advanced,"Exploring what Athanasius Kircher referred to as “The Great Art of Light and Shadow,” this course will traverse a variety of early optical devices that create the illusion of moving pictures. Focusing on inventions from the 12th to 19th centuries, we will study objects such as camera obscuras, magic lanterns, moving panoramas, Pepper’s Ghosts, and stroboscopic animation devices like zoetropes. While often considered precursors to cinema, the histories of these technologies extend beyond film to the realms of science, philosophy, theater, ritual magic, and illusion. Through screenings and readings, we will discuss how spirituality, scientific experimentation, industrialization, and capitalism shaped the invention, spectacle, and social contexts of these devices. With a perspective rooted in media archaeology, the course will trace lineages between antiquated instruments and modern technologies, highlighting concepts like stereoscopy, illumination, projection, phantasmagoria, and animation. Lectures will also feature contemporary artists and filmmakers who create works inspired by these historical apparatuses. Students will experience the wonder of these technologies through hands-on workshops and assignments in which they will recreate several devices. The course will culminate in two larger projects where students will make artwork, film, or performance based on the objects, histories, and concepts discussed in class. Students will be evaluated on their successful completion of workshops and projects, critical engagement with reading/screening materials, and thoughtful participation in class discussions.","Devices of Wonder: Moving Pictures (Intermediate/Advanced) will traverse a variety of early optical devices that create the illusion of moving pictures.

"Ferrari , Melissa ",Stop Motion Animation,ADS,Introductory/Intermediate,"Stop motion explores the wondrous process of transforming everyday objects, artifacts, and static puppets into living, breathing entities through frame-by-frame animation. In this course, students will learn strategies to conjure the illusion of motion and imbue objects with meaning, emotion, and perhaps a sense of uncanniness. The beginning of this course will introduce students to a variety of handmade animation techniques, including found object, claymation, and archival collage. From there, our focus will shift to armatured puppets, where students will learn basic fabrication techniques and make a short puppet film. Throughout the course, we’ll embrace the tactility, materiality, and handmade imperfections inherent to stop motion, while discussing formal considerations of working in miniature, including practical lighting. Screenings by historical and contemporary stop motion artists will allow us to explore stop motion’s vast potential across nonfiction, avant-garde, scientific, auteur, and fine art filmmaking. Ultimately, students will be able to use stop motion animation to create meaningful moving-image works. Technical instruction will include a basic introduction to Dragonframe animation software and Adobe Premiere for editing, as well as methods for crafting compelling, dynamic animation. Students will be evaluated on their successful completion of assignments and films, critical engagement with readings and screenings, thoughtful participation in class discussions, and file management.","Stop Motion Animation (Introductory/Intermediate) will introduce students to the art of manipulating physical objects and armatured puppets to create frame-by-frame animation.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting. Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended.

"Rock, Jennifer",Communicating Science,W,Intermediate,"Science communication is multi-dimensional, encompassing both communication within science for scientists, and between science and external audiences like ‘the public’. There are even genre-specific norms for communicating within different types of science, and there are of course many publics, which often require different communication approaches due to different audience needs and expectations. While these diverse forms of science communication each have some specific demands, and strategies for achieving them, they also hold some elements in common with other forms of argumentation, creative writing and visual communication. In this course, we explore these multiple genres of science communication, and learn some of their specific expectations and conventions. Simultaneously, we practice some of the common techniques used across many genres of communication that help us achieve fluid and logical discourse. As we experiment with different forms of written, oral and visual communication within different modes of science communication, students expand their genre analysis skills, rhetorical awareness, and communication practices. This course is suitable for students who are interested in the professional practice of science, including the practical and philosophical communication obligations of scientists. It is designed for students with a serious interest in developing their professional science skills for communicating their research within science, and for communicating science to a more general audience. Specifically, students can expect to develop an understanding of the genre-specific protocols for writing a scientific paper based on lab or field data, including practice in researching and writing the literature review component and abstract. They will also practice and apply visual and oral communication skills by constructing and presenting a scientific poster. Through a group project collaborating with an external community client, students also undertake fact sheet writing and making infographics for a general public. Readings are discussed weekly from the course text book: Scott Montgomery’s, The Chicago Guide to Communicating Science (University of Chicago Press), which acts to prime our wider deliberations about how science communication evolves culturally. These class discussions, as well as peer review sessions of both written and visual communication work facilitates students’ metacognitive and metalinguistic development. Practical exercises in science communication, for which students draft components of larger assignments and revise repeatedly, promote a fundamental understanding of writing as a process. Evaluations are based on multiple communication assignments and on active in-class participation.","<p>This course is designed for science students developing their professional communication skills.

"Morse, Suzanne",Archiving COA: a practicum,,Intermediate,"In this course, memories, documents and objects relating to a specific topic of interest to COA will be collected and archived. We will explore what is meant by an archive, why archivists of an institution choose to collect certain events and memories, the different forms archival collections can take– from physical objects to digital, the attendant risks and benefits of an archive, and what a decolonial practice might look like. The course will begin with an introduction to archiving in theory and practice in the literature and through visits to established archives in New England. Before working with specific material, each student will go through the experience of archiving a document, object, or interview, and through this examine the complexity of deciding what might be included in an archive and why. The focus area for this course will be the creation of an archival collection of the on-campus community garden that was established at the inception of the college. Together students will develop a mission for this collection and map out what kinds of information might be desirable to include and why. Materials will include images, entries from Off The Wall, journals, surveys of students and gardeners, and interviews. This course is appropriate for students with background and interest in community archives, storytelling, contextual analysis, oral histories, and/or community gardens.

"Lock, Timothy",Sustainable Architecture: Ecological Artifact,AD,Introductory,"As a species, buildings are our single greatest ecological artifact. This seminar introduces sustainable architecture through the lens of ecological design, asking: what does it mean to design and build ecologically? Drawing on a broad design framework, we will explore architecture as an interconnected practice that shapes not only our shared spaces but also the systems of energy, water, materials, ecology, and community in which they are embedded. Central to this exploration is the idea of the building as an art product, an artifact, a work that must perform within resource limits, satisfy material need, and express and hold cultural and aesthetic significance and represent and endure as part of a larger ecological and social fabric. Rather than treating sustainability as a checklist or single definition, the course will consider multiple, sometimes conflicting, logics and definitions of ecology. The first half of the course (five weeks) will introduce the five lenses through which the designer can contextualize building design and analysis: Habitable Planet; Circular Resources; Resilient Ecosystems; Protected Water Cycle; and Healthy Communities. Each student will select one common building material or component and assess its ecological impact and analyze an existing building which highlights this material. The second half will emphasize integration and synthesis, exploring how design decisions ripple across multiple dimensions and how resource efficiency can deepen rather than diminish architectural meaning. Students will design a building (new, existing, or renovation) to be proposed on a site on the College of the Atlantic campus. Students will keep a design sketchbook, contribute to discussions, and complete two major assignments that synthesize course themes. No prior coursework in architecture or design is required—only curiosity, engagement, and a willingness to explore drawing and diagramming as tools of thought. Evaluations will be based on participation, sketchbook development, short assessments of core ecological design principles, and assessment of the two primary course projects.",

What words, images, foods, music, rituals, or other sources of inspiration spark curiosity and passions that make us want to go places? Genre analysis, writing, and transdisciplinary research projects will deepen a sense of place as the course explores the rhetoric of travel and its transformative impacts. Students will experiment with, for instance, flash-essays, chronicles, interviews, journals, and field notes. Research projects will spotlight judicious selection of relevant sources, integration of data, and inclusion of multimodal elements. We will consider, too, the relation between travel writing and ethnography, between travel and gender, racial, religious, and ethnic components. Conveying impressions after short or extended excursions, students will recognize and develop which rhetorical strategies are appropriate for particular purposes, situations, audiences, discourse communities, and genres. Maps, films, infographics, letters, newspaper articles, guidebooks, blogs, Instagram posts, diaries, and logs constitute genres that may be examined and created. Students will further hone their craft in writing workshops, conversations, conferences, and presentations.

"Benson, Robert",Now what?: Finding purpose in chaotic times,HS,Introductory,"Disoriented. Disconnected. Discouraged (to say the least). In 2024-2025 we have witnessed fundamental shifts in the cultural fabric and social landscape, both nationally and internationally, along with significant threats to the lives and livelihoods of many of the world’s most vulnerable people. Questions of what to do about all this – and how to cultivate wisdom and endurance for the long haul – aren’t just strategic, but also – many suggest – inescapably spiritual as well. This course invites us to explore humanity’s sources of strength & hope, resilience & common purpose in times of uncertainty, oppression, and violence – to seek solid ground that can inspire and sustain lives oriented toward justice and transformation. Our central question will be: what nourishes lives of meaning, purpose, belonging, or advocacy ? We'll explore philosophical, psychological, ecological, communal, and even some political dimensions, and we'll join in dialogue with a variety of people for whom spirituality is a meaningfully relevant aspect of their work and their lives. If you’re wondering what to do now, or next, or curious about how people striving for justice keep their momentum, this is a course for you. Course texts will likely include Alastair McIntosh's Spiritual Activism, Parker Palmer’s Let Your Life Speak, Sherri Mitchell’s Sacred Instructions, and Joanna Macy’s Active Hope, along with shorter articles, podcasts, and / or videos relevant to the course. My perspective is that the work ahead will be difficult and generational – and I’m eager to explore with you what might make it possible for justice-oriented people to “keep on keepin’ on.” In addition to robust class discussions marked by curiosity and respect, and regularly-assigned readings of both primary and secondary sources, students can anticipate bi-weekly reflective writing assignments (1-2 pages) along with a final project / paper. As this is an introductory course, no prerequisites are required. Field trips to various faith-based institutions may be offered. Students of all faith traditions and perspectives are welcome – including students who do not identify with any particular tradition.",
"Diemler , Cory ",Physics I,ES QR,Introductory,"This course covers a range of standard introductory physics topics. The goals of the course are: to introduce students to important physical ideas both conceptually and mathematically; and to help students improve their quantitative skills. The first part of the course consists of a broad look at the three conservation laws: the conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum. Along the way, we'll learn about vectors, work, potential energy, thermal energy, and the energy stored in chemical bonds. We'll conclude with a treatment of Newton's laws of motion. Evaluations will be based on participation in class and lab, weekly homework, and one or more open-notes exams. This course makes extensive use of algebra and trigonometry. Potentially difficult math topics will be reviewed as necessary.",
"Capers, Colin",Film Theory,AD,Introductory/Intermediate,"How do motion pictures express ideas? Why do we respond to them in the ways we do? Film theorists have approached these questions from contexts as diverse as formal composition (sound, mise-en-scene, color, cinematography and editing), signs and symbols (semiotics), cultural and/or gender concerns, and psychoanalysis. In this class, we will practice using these and other theories to understand and analyze moving pictures. Each week we will screen one or two feature length movies as well as a number of short films. Screenings will be complemented by source texts from critics, theorists, artists/filmmakers and cinephiles. Students may choose to take this course as writing intensive; those who do will be required to write and revise three or four critical response essays based in analytical frameworks covered in the course. All students will be required to complete a final research paper and presentation. Students should expect to spend 7-9 hours a week in class meetings, labs and screenings (in addition to writing, research). Students will be evaluated on papers, final project and participation in discussions.",

"Titcomb , Anna",Foundations of Human Nutrition,,Introductory,"This course will cover the fundamentals of human nutrition, including dietary sources and roles of the macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, fat) and the micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). We will discuss the basics of human metabolism and digestive physiology, including blood sugar regulation, the gut microbiome, and role of supportive organs. We will examine ethical, cultural, moral, environmental, and accessibility considerations impacting practical food choices, from both an individual and systemic perspective. We will practice interactive learning through label reading, food sharing and taste-testing, and taking a field trip to the grocery store to examine how large food conglomerates have shaped and continue to shape the American food landscape. Assessment will be based on attendance and participation in class and interactive situations, a midterm written exam, and a final project in which students will be encouraged to research and present nutritional information and considerations for a niche population or area of their own interest (e.g. pre/post-natal nutrition, regenerative agriculture/permaculture, indigenous or traditional foodways, slow food movement, athletic/sports nutrition, eating disorders, etc).",
