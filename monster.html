Monster is large.  She eats a lot and thus is big.  She got her name
becuase she reminds us of the 
<a href="http://www.stevens-tech.edu/~dbelson/cookie.gif"> 
Cookie Monster</a>.  She likes to
purr, eat, and sleep.  She really likes those large twisties that
come wrapped around heads of lettuce.  We crumple it up, and she
plays with it for hours, batting it along the floor or grabbing it
in her mouth and flinging it toward the sky.
