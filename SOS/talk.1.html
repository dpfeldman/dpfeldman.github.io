<center><h1> Introduction </h1></center>



Most of this talk is based on stuff I learned while at the American
Association of Physics Teachers winter meeting.  In particular, my
report is based on the following three presentations:
<ol>
<li><b>Graduate Student Preparation Examined in the Light of the
	Staffing Needs of Two-Year Colleges</b>.  Judith Tavel, Dept. of
	Mathematics, Physical and Computer Sciences, Dutchess Comm. College,
	Poughkeepsie, NY.<p>  

<li><b> Preparing and Applying for Faculty Positions at Baccalaureate Degree
	Institutions</b>.  Dennis C. Henry, Physics Dept., Gustavus 
	Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN. <<p><B> I have an outline of
	this talk, handed out by Dr. Henry at Reno.  If you want to
	make a copy of it, stop by and see me!</b><p>

<li><b>Climbing the Ladder to Employability</b>.  Joe West, Dept. of 
	Physics, Wabash College, Crawfordsville, IN.<p></ol>


Some of my comments are also based on stuff I've heard here at Davis
at the "Careers in Higher Education: the Interview Process" seminar
series.<p>


My comments on high school teaching are based on my experience as a 
teacher at The McCallie School,  8/91 - 6/93. <p>

<h1>General Comments <p>

</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li> Huge numbers apply for positions, but around 75% of applicants are 
    grossly under or misqualified.<p>
</H3>
The rest of this talk is about what we can do to make sure we're in the
other 25%.
<h3>

<li> Understand the type of institution to which you're applying!! <p>
</h3> "Treat your application as you would a major research grant."
Do your homework.  Have other people read over your application.
<h3>


<li> Get actual <i> teaching </i> experience, not just TAing. <p>
</h3>  Everyone has been a TA; having a lot of TAs will not make your	
	application stand out.  Things we can do:  Program in College Teaching,
	Chancellor's teaching fellowship.
<h3>


<li> Have some thoughts about pedagogy. <p>
</h3> 
Be aware of the current trends in physics teaching.  Know what is meant
by student centered learning, discovery learning, etc.  How will you 
incorporate new technology into your teaching?  Don't just TA, <i> think </i>
about teaching and talk about it with others.
<h3>

<li> Good written and oral communication skills are absolutely
    essential. <p>
</h3>
Remember, it is mostly likely that during the entire hiring process,
you will not talk to anyone who is an expert in the area of your thesis
work.  Not only
is is important that you be able to communicate clearly, but you must
be able to make yourself understood to those outside of your field. 
In my opinion, the "what I do is hard so it's ok that nobody understands
it" attitude almost guarantees that you will never get a teaching job.  <p>

There are lots of opportunities to practice speaking.  There's the Journal Club
(GSSS), of course, and there are many meetings.  In addition to the
big APS meetings, there are AAPT meetings, an annual UC nonlinear science
conference, and annual UC stat mech conference, etc.<p>
<h3>
<li> <i> Breadth </i> is good.   <p>
</h3>
Departments at teaching institutions are usually quite small.  The more
you can do, the better.  How many courses could you teach?  Could you
run labs?  Act as a department system administrator?  Maintain lab
equipment?
<h3>

<h1> Community Colleges <p>

</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>  <i> ALL </i> research must focus on pedagogy.<p>

<li>  All classes at first and second year level. <p>

<li> Small classes, enormous diversity in ability and learning styles. <p>

<li> CC's are open to <i> all </i> students.  <p>
</h3>
A "Darwinian" approach to learning is not in keeping with the community
college's mission.<p>

Making it apparent in your cover letter that you don't
understand the above four items is a good way to get your
application immediately removed from consideration.
<h3>

<li> 2/3 of community college physics departments are 1 person!   <p>
</h3>
Hence, breadth is important.  You better be able to do it all.
<h3>

<li> There are between 100 and 150 applicants per position.<p>
</h3>
This stat is for Dutchess Community College, in Poughkeepie NY.
<h3>

<li> Between 2000 and 2010, approximately 1/2 of all CC physics
    teachers will retire.  On average, 70/year.   <p>
</h3>
Someone kinda official said this, but I think it should be taken 
with a grain of salt.
<h3>
<li>  An M.S. is all that is required to teach at a CC in most states.<P>
</h3>
So, if you want to teach part time at a CC while finishing up your
dissertation, be sure to pick up an MS along the way.  However, Roger
Miller tells me that the M.S. is not a requirement for CC teaching in
California.  He mentioned something about needing a B.A (or B.S, I
suppose) and two years of experience doing something somewhere.  I'm not
sure on the details.  If anyone has some better information, let me know
and I'll post it here.

<h1> Liberal Arts Colleges <p>

</h3>
</center>
<p>

<h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>  Take courses outside your area of expertise.<p>
</h3>  Theorists, take an advanced lab course. (Ug.)   Hi energy types, take
a solid state course.  Etc.  Being able to teach intro Astronomy is a big
plus.
<h3>


<li> Research:   <p>

<ul>
<li> Suitcase and/or BIG physics is bad.  <p>

<li> "Be able to find and fund a sustainable undergraduate
    research program."   <p>
</h3>
(This is a direct quote from the chair of the physics department of 
Gustavus Adolphus College.  He added that the above criteron is often a
deciding factor when determining who gets invited to campus for interviews.)  
Keep this in mind when thinking about post-docs.  However... <p>
</ul>
A recently hired faculty member mentioned that it's a good idea to start
building a collection of projects that would be suitable for undergraduates
to work on.  <p>
<h3>
<li> Many liberal arts colleges do not require post-docs. <p>
<li> Don't overlook visiting positions.<p>
</h3>
Visiting positions at liberal arts colleges are usually very different than
the "visiting" lectureships here at UCD.  Liberal arts colleges are small;
visitors are a way to bring new ideas and energy into the department.
At most schools, visitors are treated like a real member of the department.
They teach at all levels and are expected and encouraged to carry on
scholarly activity.  These positions can be good stepping stones.  (More
than one person at the conference mentioned this.)
<h3>


<li>  There are roughly 100 openings per year at baccalaureate
	degree institutions.<p>
</h3>
Note that liberal arts colleges is a subset of baccalaureate degree
institutions.  I trust this nubmer as an order of magnitude estimate, but
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

<h1> Four-Year State Colleges <p>

</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>  Similar to liberal arts college.<p>

<li> Perhaps less of an emphasis on research. <p>

<li> Probably wider range of students <p>

</ol>
</h3>

<br>
<h1> Private High Schools <p>

</h1>
</center>
<p>

<h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>  Similar to Community Colleges.<p>

<li>  I've known quite a few people who left CC's and state schools
    to teach HS.   <p>

<li>  Might have to coach, deal with parents, lead field trips, run
    clubs, etc., etc.   <p>
</h3>
This could either be a big plus or a big minus, depending on your point
of view.  
<h3>

<li>  Opportunity to teach lots of different classes.   <p>
</h3>
Many schools  don't teach enough physics to have someone
who is <i> just </i> a physics teacher.  Thus, you might find yourself 
teaching math, chemistry, even biology.  As above, this could be good
or bad, depending on your point of view.
<h3>

<li>  <I> LOTS </I> of opportunities for innovation and pedagogical
    research.  <p>  
</h3>
It is likely that your teaching load will be lighter at a High School.
The leaves more time to experiment with teaching techniques and lab
apparatus, etc.  At many (but not all!) schools, this is highly encouraged.
<h3>

<li>  Be careful, the character of private high schools ranges widely.   <p>
</h3>  
There are large schools, small schools, traditional schools, non-traditional
schools, coed schools, single-sex schools, conservative schools, liberal
schools, Christian schools, Jewish schools, non-religious schools, schools
with a power-bent administration, schools with a <i> laissez faire </I>
administration, etc., etc.


</ol>

I've been through the application process for independent private schools
(kinda twice, actually).  If you want to know more, just ask me!
