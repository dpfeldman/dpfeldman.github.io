Future linear colliders will depend on new sources of RF power
to deliver the requisite accelerating gradient.  A promising 
scheme is the two-beam accelerator (TBA).  An high-current,
low-energy electron (drive) beam is used to supply RF power to a 
low-current, high-energy electron or positron (target) beam.  
The drive beam is passed through resonant cavities to extract
useful power, which is fed via waveguides to the targer beam.
It is then re-accelerated, and the process continues repeatedly
to boost overall efficiency.  The inherent instabilities in this 
process ultimately limit the number of times that extraction can 
occur.  The study, characterization, and control of the instabilities
are therefore a prime concern.
<p>

I will discuss the most important of the instabilities which derive
from the interaction of the drive beam with the extraction cavities.
After introducing the wakefield formalism, which is a powerful way 
to describe the interaction, I will discuss analytical methods I use
to calculate the wakefields.  I will conclude with a discussion of
ways to counter the deleterious effects on the drive beam.
