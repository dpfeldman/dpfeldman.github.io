<h1> Abstract for Bennett Corrado's Talk </h1>
<p>

This talk will be a review of the information I have acquired
in the past year as Chair of the Graduate Student Association, and during
my internship in Washington D.C. this summer.  I will be summarizing some
of the recent reports from the NRC and NSF concerning graduate education
in the physical sciences, and updating y'all on what the campus plans to
do with this information.  Also, I will tell of what I saw happening on
Capital Hill this summer regarding funding for and attitudes toward basic
scientific research.
