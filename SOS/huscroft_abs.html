<h1> Abstract for Carey Huscroft's Talk </h1>
<p>

Certain films, metallic at high temperature, join one of three separate, very different classes as their temperature is lowered; they become superconductors, insulators, or metals. This different behavior is caused by the complicated interactions of the electrons in the films with each other and with disorder in the films.  An appropriate Hamiltonian to model such systems is the negative-U (attractive), disordered Hubbard Model.  I will discuss Determinant (Quantum) Monte Carlo techniques to perform theoretical calculations of relevant ground-state properties of this model as a function of disorder in the system.  I hope to then show recent results of a probe of the superconductor--insulator phase transition using these techniques.
