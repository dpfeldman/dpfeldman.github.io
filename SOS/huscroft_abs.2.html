The Quantum Monte Carlo simulations that we perform in our research are done using a path-integral formulation in imaginary time.  Hence, our time-dependent results are given in imaginary time.  While this is convenient, real physical processes take place in real time.  To obtain real time quantities, such as the density of states, it is necessary to analytically continue our results (Green's functions) to the real time axis.  Unfortunately, this is very difficult to do <i>numerically,</i> partly because our Monte Carlo data is noisy.

Various approaches and attempts have been tried to perform this analytic continuation.  We are considering using one such technique, still under development: analytic continuation via Maximum Entropy.

I will give a brief overview of the problem and report on some reading that I have done on the subject.  I hope to conclude with a statement of feasibility.  This is not a preparation for any other talk, and I plan to make it accessible to a broad audience. <i>Please come and let me know whether I have succeeded!</i>
