<ol>
<li>  Similar to Community Colleges.<p>

<li>  I've known quite a few people who left CC's and state schools
    to teach HS.   <p>

<li>  Might have to coach, deal w/ parents, lead field trips, run
    clubs, etc., etc.   <p>

<li>  Opportunity to teach lots of different classes.   <p>

<li>  <I> LOTS </I> of opportunities for innovation and pedagogical
    research.  <p>

<li>  Be careful, the character of private high schools ranges widely.   <p>
