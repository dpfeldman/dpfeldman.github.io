<h3>
"Multi-Atom Interactions in the 2D Metallic Systems"  M. C. Fallis
</h3>
<p>

	Quantum mechanics tells us that the metallic bond is <em>not </em>
pairwise 
additive but is instead significantly multi-atom in nature.  To simulate and
study the physics of metallic systems, one desires a simplified (for 
interpretability) description of metallic bonding which captures its multi-atom
nature (for accuracy).  In this talk, I will describe a new lattice gas model
(BSM for "Bond Saturation Model") which fulfills these requirements.  Choosing
the Pt(111) surface as my proving ground, I will demonstrate how the BSM 
facilitates a very detailed understanding of the energetics of two dimensional
(2D) homoepitaxial adatom clusters on close-packed metallic surfaces.  I will
also compare the predictions of the BSM and a pair bond model (with strictly 2
body interactions) for the high temperature (2D) morphology of Pt(111) using 
monte carlo simulations. <p>
