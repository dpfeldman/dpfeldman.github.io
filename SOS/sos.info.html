<h2> Students only Seminar </h2>
<h3> General Information and Logistics </h3> <p>


The Students only Seminar is designed to privide gradaute students with a 
supportive environment in which to practice their speaking skills and
share their physics interests with peers.  We ask that faculty attend
only if invited by the speaker. <p>

We meet approximately once a week.  Check the postings in the hallway
or the <a href="winter97.html"> schedule on the web page</a> for details.
Cookies will be provided.  You should bring your own beverage if you
think you might get thirsty.<p>

Almost any physics topic is appropriate material for a talk.  
Talks need not be a discussion of your (or someone else's) cutting-edge
research.  Talks discussing issues related to finding jobs in industry,
academia, or elsewhere are also appropriate.
<p>

Talks can last from 20 minutes to 50 minutes (including questions).  We will
try to schedule two twenty-minute talks or one 45-minute talk per meeting. <p>
If you are interested in giving a talk, please contact Matt Enjalran,
<A HREF="mailto:enjalran@landau.ucdavis.edu"> 
enjalran@landau.ucdavis.edu </A>  <p>

An important compontent of the Students only Seminar is the the opportunity
to get feedback from other grad students.  At the end of each talk, a review
form will be distributed to each person attending.  We hope that honest,
constructive criticism will help each of us improve our physics
speaking skills. 
If you're curious, you can see a <A HREF="eval.latex"> Latex </A>
or a <A HREF="eval.ps.Z"> PostScript </A> copy of the speaker evaluation form
we've prepared.  <p>

Those of us who have given talks before have found the feedback we've
gotten very useful in preparing for orals, APS talks, etc.  However, this
isn't a one-way street.  The SOS won't accomplish its goals if people
give talks to mostly empty rooms.  The idea is that we all help each
other out by providing honest feedback and advice.  It seems to me to
be unreasonable to expect to give a talk to a large audience without
ever having attended anyone else's talk.<p>
