<h1> Abstract for Ron Sobey's Talk </h1> <p>

  The Tevatron is the only place, as of now, where vector boson pair 
production has been done.  This has allowed preliminary test of the 3 vector
bson coupling.  Just as the Tevatron is where the top quark was dicovered, 
it will continue to allow us to explore new physics like super-symmetry and 
higgs physics. <p>
  To search for new physics we need to know the standard model background.  We 
also would like to completely test the Electroweak theory by looking at the
quartic vertices.  For these reason I have been doing monte  carlo simmulations
of three boson production at tevatron energies.  Specifically I have looked at:
p pbar -> W gama gama, Z gama gama, W W gama, W Z gama, Z Z gama;
p pbar -> W W W, W W Z, ZZZ, WZZ
and since the top quark can be produced at the tevatron I have also looked at:
p pabr -> t tbar W, t tbar, Z, t tbar gama; where t->b w at 100%. <p>



  In doing this work it was found that the W gama gama process had some
unqiue cancelations between the diagrams that reduced the cross section below
what one would expaect by kinematical arguements.  I plan to further study 
this effect to understand how deviations from the standard model might 
effect it.  <p>
