<h1>  Applying for Teaching Positions: </h1>
<h2> A Report form Reno </h2>
</Center>

<p>

I recently attended the American Association of Physics teachers winter
meeting in Reno, NV.  I attended several talks focusing on how graduate
students can prepare themselves to be competitive for teaching faculty 
positions. <p>


I will begin by discussing some general advice which is of relevance
for applying for teaching positions at a wide range of institutions.
I will then discuss some issues specific to different types of
institutions:  community colleges, liberal arts colleges, state colleges,
and private high schools. <p>
