<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>We compare and contrast three different, but complementary views
of "structure" and "pattern" in spatial processes. For definiteness
and analytical clarity we apply all three approaches to the simplest
class of spatial processes: one-dimensional Ising spin systems with
finite-range interactions. These noncritical systems are well-suited for
this study since the change in structure as a function of system parameters
is more subtle than that found in critical systems where, at a phase
transition, many observables diverge thereby making the detection of
change in structure obvious.
<p>
This survey demonstrates that the measures of pattern from information
theory and computational mechanics differ from known thermodynamic and
statistical mechanical functions. Moreover, they capture important
structural features that are otherwise missed. In particular, a type of
mutual information called the <b>excess entropy</b>---an information
theoretic measure of memory---serves to detect ordered, low entropy
density patterns. It is superior in many respects to other functions
used to probe the structure of a configuration distribution, such as
magnetization and structure factors. epsilon-Machines---the main
objects of computational mechanics---are seen to be the most direct
approach to revealing the (group and semigroup) symmetries possessed by
the spatial patterns and to estimating the minimum amount of memory
required to reproduce the configuration ensemble, a quantity known as
the <b>statistical complexity</b>. Finally, we argue that the information
theoretic and computational mechanical analyses of spatial patterns
capture the intrinsic computational capabilities embedded in spin
systems---how they store, transmit, and manipulate configurational
information to produce spatial structure.
