<h2 align=center>Marine Studies at College of the Atlantic</h2>


<BR>

<P> The College of the
Atlantic prides itself on offering just one interdisciplinary major
called <i>Human Ecology</i> that requires the students to design their
own course of study while encouraging them to think outside the rigid
boundaries in place at other schools.  In brief, there are no set
majors at COA -- every student designs her or his own, combining 
different fields of study to best meet her or his career goals and
aspirations.  Nevertheless, students often choose to focus or
concentrate in a particular area or areas. <p>

<b>Marine Studies</b> is a common focus area, and one in which COA has
considerable depth and breadth.  This fact sheet lists professors,
courses, and facilities, in marine studies and related areas. <p>

A student who comes to COA with an interest in Marine Studies may also
want to include photography and history in her or his personal
curriculum, or creative writing and international law.  Since all
"majors" at COA are self-designed, achieving this diversity in courses
is easy to do.  The result is that students are free to explore
connections and interrelations between different subjects.  Our
graduates are thus well equipped to understand -- and make a difference 
in -- complex environmental and social problems. <P>

<b>Course Areas: ecology, zoology, animal behavior, anatomy, and
physiology.</b><br>

B.A. University of California, Berkeley, 1979; M.A. Ecology and
Systematic Biology, San Francisco State University, 1982;
Ph.D. Biological Sciences, University of Rhode Island, 1987.<P>

John's research involves slapping microbes on little birds. Normally
you'd get in trouble for this, but since it's science, it's ok. <p>

<br>


<b>Helen Hess</b>: hhess@ecology.coa.edu<br>

<b>Course Areas: history of life, invertebrate zoology and
biomechanics.</b><br>

B.S. University of California Los Angeles, 1985; Ph.D. Zoology,
University of Washington, 1991.<p>
Helen teaches a variety of courses at COA, most of which involve a
significant field or lab component.  Her formal training as an
invertebrate zoologist has lead her to develop courses that take her
and her students wherever invertebrates are found, including local
rivers, Maine's rocky intertidal shores, and Caribbean coral reefs.
Helen's research interests focus on the reproductive biology of marine
organisms, and she has studied parental behavior in worms, mating
systems in mouthbrooding in fishes, and the evolution of
self-fertilization in hermaphroditic invertebrates.  While she mainly
identifies herself as a teacher at COA, she also enjoys including
students in her research activities.  She is currently working with
COA students on a project studying the reproductive biology of
large, local sea cucumber species that is the target of an emergent
fishery.  In addition, she is also involved in writing papers with COA
students on research projects on cleaning behavior in tropical reef
fishes and on the evolution of egg size in fishes. <p>

Chris teaches classes in marine biology, ecology, evolution, and
policy. His research focuses on the reproductive biology of 
fishes, and he has involved students in his research projects in
Maine, in the Pacific Northwest, and in the Caribbean. His 
current research projects involve work on sculpin reproductive
biology, cleaning symbioses in the Caribbean, sea cucumber 
fisheries, estuarine fish ecology, life-history modeling and
fertilization ecology of marine fishes. Much of this work is being 
done collaboratively with COA students and leading to coauthored
publications with students. Chris collaborates with scientists 
at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Scripps Institute of
Oceanography, Illinois State University, Mount Desert 
Island Biological Laboratory, and the University of Padova, Italy. His
work is currently supported by grants from the National 
Science Foundation and the Rockefeller Fund for Marine Conservation
(check title). Chris has published over 30 peer-reviewed 
papers, and is an associate editor of the <i>American Naturalist</i>.

<b>Sean Todd</b>: stodd@ecology.coa.edu <a href="http://www.coa.edu/faculty/webpages/stodd/">http://www.coa.edu/faculty/webpages/stodd/</a><br> 
<b> Course Areas: biology, sensory
ecology, oceanography, statistics, and marine mammals.</b><br>

B.Sc. University College of North Wales, UK; M.Sc. Memorial
University, St. John's, Newfoundland; Ph.D. Biopsychology, Memorial
University, 1998.<p>

Sean directs COA's remote field station at Mount Desert Rock, and
coordinates Allied Whale (COA's whale research and rehabilitation
organization) responses to marine mammal strandings. 
Much of Sean's background is in the field of fishery-marine mammal
interactions. 

Prior to joining the faculty at COA, Sean spent ten years in
Newfoundland as part of the Whale 
Disentanglement team, a group that releases large entangled whales
from fishing gear. In Maine he is trained as part of a first response
team that performs a similar function, coordinated by the Center for
Coastal Studies. He has also worked on several projects that
successfully designed alarms for fishing gear that reduce marine
mammal entanglements.  He also has extensive experience in the
photo-identification, biopsy, and cataloging of North Atlantic
Humpback and Fin Whales.

Together with his collaborators, Sean has published around a dozen
peer-reviewed papers and research reports.  He has served as a
reviewer for peer-reviewed journals, book publishers, and various
granting agencies.  <P>

<h3>Facilities and Resources</h3>

Resources available to students with appropriate training  include:
The college's two field stations on Great Duck Island and Mt. Desert
Rock; the R.V. Indigo, a 42 ft. vessel equipped for both day cruises
and limited overnight trips; cooperative agreements with The Nature
Conservancy, The National Park Service, and the State of Maine,
allowing access to field sites; The Jackson laboratory and Mt Desert
Island Biological Labs, providing fully equipped lab space for
research in molecular biology and environmental physiology; the
Collaborative Research Center at CoA, offering equipment for field
study and work space for students and faculty; the COA GIS lab,
providing a fully equipped Geographic Information System using the
ARC/INFO platform.  Some of these facilities and resources are
described in more detail below. <p>

<h3>Student research support</h3> 
Student research, both with COA faculty and outside of the college, is
well supported by several funds including grants from the National
Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, NOAA, and
Rockefeller. This work includes molecular biology research at nearby
Jackson Laboratory and Mount Desert Island Biological Lab, field
ecology at our field stations off the coast of Maine, as well as work
with researchers from Maryland to Malaysia. <p>


<b>Great Duck Island</b>:  Great Duck Island, located approximately an
hour and a half by boat to the south of the COA campus, is a 220 acre
island that the College shares with the Nature Conservancy, the State 
of Maine, and a private summer resident.  The Great Duck Island Light
Station has been converted to the College's Alice Eno Research
Station. The station has recently benefited from the College's Green
Technology Initiative, converting to a more sustainable power grid,
employing photovoltaics and a generator running bio-diesel. The
current research focus on Great Duck centers around the island's
seabird populations.  Each summer a team of 4-6 students under the
supervision of faculty member John Anderson examines habitat selection
and reproductive biology of gulls, guillemots, and storm petrels.  For
the past two summers, thanks to a collaborative relationship with
Intel's Berkeley Research Lab, the team has been examining
micro-environmental conditions both within petrel burrows and in
surrounding habitat. Details of this work can be found at our web site
<a href="http://greatduckisland.net">http://greatduckisland.net</a>
<P> 

<b>Allied Whale</b>: Allied Whale is the marine mammal research
station at College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine. Founded in
1972, Allied 
Whale has developed techniques for photo-identification studies of
humpback and finback whales. These research techniques are used by
scientists worldwide to study these endangered species. Allied Whale
curates both the North Atlantic Humpback and Finback Catalogs which
contain the largest collection of photographs and data on North
Atlantic humpbacks and finbacks in the world.  Allied Whale also
rescues clumsy seals who beach themselves and sometimes hosts whale
barbecues on COA's beach.  Learn more about Allied Whale at <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/alliedwhale/">http://www.coa.edu/alliedwhale/</a>.
<P>


<b>Mount Desert Rock</b>: This is a sucky pile of rocks in the middle
of the ocean, but it's a prime location for marine
mammal research. Both Mount Desert Rock and the nearby Inner Schoodic
Ridges are areas of upwelling, creating localized zones of high
biological productivity. Species commonly sighted included humpback,
finback, harbor porpoise, common and white-sided dolphin, and harbor
and gray seals.  But mostly one sees fog and water.  Recently, Allied
Whale has initiated a five-year study of marine mammal populations in
the northern Gulf of Maine, using Mount Desert Rock as a base of
operations.<p> 

<b>Biomedical/Genetic Research Opportunities at Mount Desert Island
Biological Laboratory</b><P> 


<b>Facilities on Campus</b>.  Christiansen Zoology lab and Island
Rearch Center, on COA's campus, provide facilities and support for
students to continue their research back on our campus. <p>


<!--<b>Sea Education Association (SEA)</b>: This is a 12 week, full credit
allied program based in Woods Hole, MA.  Students spend the first six
weeks of the program on land, taking classes ranging from oceanography
to celestial navigation and maritime history.  The next six weeks are
spent on an oceanographic sailing vessel.  Students are responsible
for class work as well as boat navigation.-->
