I am almost always able to write a letter of recommendation for former
or current students.  Very, very rarely I feel I can't write a letter
because I don't know a student well or I couldn't write a positive
letter.  I will let you know in the extremely unlikely event that this
is the case.  </p>  

<p>If I'm writing letters of recommendation for you, there are a few
  things you can do that will help me write a  better letter and will
  keep me sane. 
<ul>
  <li>Send me an email for each letter you want me to write.  In this
    email, please clearly indicate the due date for the letter, to
    whom it should be addressed, and when it is due.  If you are
    applying for grad school, please specify the exact name of the
    department/program you area applying to.  E.g., is it "Department
    of Art History" or the "Art History Department?"  And also specify
    the exact name of the degree you are seeking. 
  
  <li>If you want to send me multiple letter requests in one single
    email, that's fine too.  Just please separate the requests
    clearly, and list due dates and such.  In a typical year I write
    60-70 letters, so it gets to be a  lot to keep track of.  But once
    I have the basic info and due date on my to-do list, it won't get
    lost.   

  <li>Send me a copy of your CV or resume.  This is helpful since
    sometimes I comment on other things you've done in addition to
    taking classes and/or working with me.  This is especially
    important if you're applying after you've been out of school for a
    few years. 

  <li>Please send me a copy of the statement of purpose of application
    essay.  It doesn't have to be a final copy.  A rough draft is
    fine.  I'm not going to quote from this or critique it, but it's
    helpful for me to read it so I can put my letter in context.  For
    example, if you write about how you want to go to grad school so
    you can save endangered squids, but I write that you are going to
    grad school to pursue your love of statistics, my letter might not
    be so effective. 

  <li>If there is anything you want me to highlight in my letter,
    please let me know.  Perhaps there are some aspects of your work
    that you're especially proud of.  Or maybe you are worried that a
    graduate department will need reassuring about some part of your
    background.   

  <li>If the recommendation is a hard-copy letter, there is no need to
    fill out an envelope.  I will write or print the address on a
    spiffy official COA envelope.  You also don't need to give me
    stamps.  I have a budget for those.

  <li>It's really helpful to have at least a week or two lead time to
    write a letter, especially the first letter of the season.  Stuff
    happens, though, and if you need a letter on shorter notice, I
    understand. 
</ul>



Writing recommendations takes a little bit of time, but it's part of
our job.  So you shouldn't hesitate to ask.   Also, once I have one
letter written for you, writing another letter is quick and
easy. Letter writing is one of those favors that is not really repaid,
but instead
is <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward">"paid
  forward."</a>  I had people in the past who wrote letters for me; I
am writing letters for you; and someday you will write letters for
others.
