<h3>why would i want research experience?</h3>

<br>
If you are at all interested in the sciences, I strongly suggest that
you consider doing at least one, and preferably two research
experiences while an undergraduate.  There are several reasons why I
think a research experience is a good idea: </p>  

<ul>
  <li>It's fun.  Research is interesting,
  exhilarating, frustrating, and exciting.  A research experience can
  be a good way to meet some interesting people and possibly see some
  new parts of the world.  You usually get room and board and a modest
  stipend.  You won't get rich, but you can usually make a little
  money and have a good experience.<p>

  <li>It might turn out, of course, that research isn't fun.  If so,
  this is a good thing to figure out sooner rather than later.  There
  are many, many different styles of science and it might take a
  little while to see which, if any, are right for you.  Some research
  is done with large teams, others almost independently.  Some
  research is outside in the field, some is inside in a lab or
  office.  Some research is very experimental, other is theoretical
  or computational.  Some research is product-driven (developing a
  particular medicine or piece of hardware or software) and other
  research is more basic or fundamental.  So getting one or two
  different sorts of research experiences can help you sample these
  different styles of research and help you figure out what sort of
  work you want to do in graduate school and beyond. <p>

  <li>It can help you make the most out of your subsequent classes.
  In the process of doing your research you will likely come to
  realize that you don't know all the things you need to know and
  don't have all the skills you wish you had.  (This is normal.  It
  happens to experienced researchers all the time.)  You can then use
  this to help you figure out what classes to take, and how to
  approach them.  For example, you may discover that you need to
  improve your writing, or your knowledge of statistics or genetics or 
  differential equations.  Having hit a wall in a research experience
  provides a very powerful  motivation for subsequent learning.<p>
  
  <li>Having at least one research experience is very helpful for
  getting into most science graduate schools.  I don't have any data
  on this, but I suspect that few applicants to PhD programs who have
  no research experience get accepted.  Having two experiences is even
  better.  PhDs are research degrees.  Yes, you need to take classes
  and then usually pass some sort of comprehensive exam in your
  discipline.  But PhDs are really about research, so admissions
  committees are looking to see that applicants understand this and
  have some research experience.  A letter writer who can speak to how
  you did in the lab or the field is a big help.

</ul>


<h3>how do I find research opportunities??</h3>
<br>
There are many, many programs designed to give undergraduates research
experience.  Most of these are fairly structured.  A department or
institute will host a bunch of students, each of whom will work on a
project with a faculty mentor.  There will also usually be activities
and seminars that all undergraduates will participate in.
The vast majority of these programs take place in the summer.
Here are some thoughts on how to find them.  

<ul>

  <li>The U.S. National Science Foundation funds Research Experiences
  for Undergraduates (REUs).  "An REU Site consists of a group of ten
  or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host
  institution. Each student is associated with a specific research
  project, where he/she works closely with the faculty and other
  researchers."  You can search for an REU
  site <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cfm">here</a>.
  There are lots and lots to choose from.<p>

  <li>The NSF does not include most medical research, which is funded
  by the National Institutes of Health.  I don't know if there is an
  NIH version of the REU program.<p>

  <li>A list of summer research opportunities for physics and
  astronomy graduate students can be
  found <a href="http://www.compadre.org/student/research/browse.cfm">here</a>. <p>

  <li>Go the the departmental website of another college and search
  their resources.  For example, if you are interested in chemistry,
  do a little googling and find the chemistry department websites for
  a few colleges with good undergraduate programs in chemistry.
  (Schools to try include Carleton, Middlebury, Amherst, Swarthmore,
  Haverford, etc.)  Often these departments will have good lists of
  research opportunities.  For example:
  <ul>
    <li>Haverford's Department of Biology has a good list
    of <a href="http://www.haverford.edu/biology/resources/student.php">student
    resources</a>.  A few are only for Haverford students, but most
    are available to all.
    <li>Carleton College's Department of Physics and Astronomy has a
  good <a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/physics/for_students/reu/">list
  of summer REUs and internships</a>.  (The page says 2008, but it's
  actually for 2010.)
  <li>Carleton's Biology Department
  has <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/biol/opportunities/">a
  good list</a>, too.
  <li>Barnard has
  a <a href="http://www.barnard.edu/hspp/Internship%20website/Summer_internships.htm">huge
  and well organized list</a> covering multiple scientific fields. 
  </ul>  Don't rely on only these.  There are many other good lists of
  resources out there.  <p>

  <li>There are announcements of opportunities emailed out via COA
   email from time to time.  If you are interested in working at
   either The Jackson Lab or MDIBL, contact Chris Petersen.<p>

  <li>I would recommend against doing generic google searches for
  internships.  You'll turn up a lot of stuff, but it might not be the
  most efficient use of your time. <p>

  <li>Talk to faculty member(s) in the sciences and see what they
  recommend.<p>

  <li>If you are not a U.S. citizen finding a research experience in
  the U.S. can be a lot harder.  Many, but not all, internships are
  limited to U.S. citizens.  However, there are some other
  opportunities out there.  Start searching early, and talk to
  faculty for help and advice.

</ul>

<h3>applying for research internships</h3>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You should probably apply to between 5 and 10 internships.  Some are
fairly competitive, so you want to be sure to apply to a bunch. <p>

<li>Work with a faculty member to help you prepare your research
  statement and CV.  We can offer valuable advice.<p>

<li>The application process can be a pain, since the applications
  aren't quite standard.  Programs will often want slightly different
  things in their applications.  So brace yourself.<p>

<li>Talk to other students who have gotten research experiences and
  ask them for advice.<p>

<li>Work with the writing center, especially if you are an English
  language learner or struggle with writing.  A poorly written
  application will almost surely be unsuccessful.  Your application
  does not need to be a great piece of literature, but it does need to
  read ok and be grammatically correct. 

</ul>
