I have developed a series of lectures which I have delivered at the
Santa Fe Institute's
annual <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools-complex-systems-summer-schools.php">Complex
  Systems Summer School</a> in Beijing China since 2004.  A list of
topics covered is below.  Here are the slides from the two most recent 
versions of the lectures:

<ul><li>Beijing 2008 [<a href="./Feldman.china.08.pdf">pdf</a>]
    (17MB, 295 slides)
<li>Paris 2007 [<a href="./feldman.paris.2007.pdf">pdf</a>]
    (17MB, 293 slides)
</ul>

The Paris lectures were given at the Complex Systems Summer School,
<a href="http://www.iscpif.fr/tiki-index.php">Institut des Systemes
  Complex de Paris Ile-de-France</a> in Paris.<p>
