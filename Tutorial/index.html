I produced these lecture notes during July of 1997 for use in
conjunction with a series of three lectures I gave at the <a
href="http://www.santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</a>.  I did a light
edit of these notes in April of 1998 and again in October of 2002.
These notes are still a little 
rough in some places and aren't as thorough as they should be.
Nevertheless, they are (I believe) mostly error-free and could be of
some use to others.<p>

If you're looking for an introduction to computational mechanics, I
also recommend a recent paper of mine, <a
href="../Publications/DNCO.html">Discovering Non-Critical Organization:
Statistical Mechanical, Information Theoretic, and Computational Views
of Patterns in One-Dimensional Spin Systems</a>.  This paper has fairly
lengthy review of information theory and computational mechanics.
It's written at a slightly higher level than these lecture notes, but
nevertheless should be quite readable.
<p>

For more on Shannon entropy convergence and how this leads to a 
variety of measures of structure and memory, you might want to see
<a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Publications/RURO.html">Regularities 
Unseen, Randomness Observed: Levels of Entropy Convergence</a>, another
recent paper.  <P>
