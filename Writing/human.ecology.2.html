What is human ecology? In my remarks today I'd like to say a few
things about the academic philosophy at COA known as human
ecology. This isn't the last word, by any means, on what human ecology
is or should be, but they're ideas that I've thought about in my six
years here, and I've found them useful as I try continually to figure
out what I'm doing at the wonderful but different little
college. Perhaps these ideas will be of some use to you as you begin
your own human ecology journey. Or, perhaps you'll tell me in a few
days or a few years that I've got it all wrong. Either outcome would
be fine by me.    <p>
 
<h3>What is human ecology?</h4>


<h4>Don't worry about the definition</h4>

My first response is: don't worry
about the definition of human ecology too much. It's something that
sometimes first year students get angsty about, but there's no
need. For one, there are lots of things that we study and strive
toward that we can't define. But this doesn't invalidate these as
ideas or ideals. For example, who can define how to be a good son or
daughter, or a good parent, a good citizen, a good partner? But that
doesn't stop us from striving toward these things, or making these any
less real or important. Definitions aren't always that useful. <p>

Also, almost all areas of study are difficult to define. Try coming up
with a definition of mathematics, art, or poetry. But part of the
problem is is that these words--mathematics, art, poetry--are used all
the time, while human ecology is relatively uncommon. So it's
inevitable that you'll be asked what it is, especially by your parents
and friends at other schools. So one response is to turn the question
around--tell your parents that you'll explain human ecology as soon as
they provide a definition of art. This should buy you some
time.<p> 

<h4>It's not a thing</h4>

It's not a thing A second point about human ecology. It's not a
thing. In my opinion--one which is not shared by all at COA--human
ecology is not a discrete "lump" of knowledge sitting out there
somewhere. An essential part of human ecology is action: doing and
making and changing, not just learning. <p>

In this sense Human Ecology is like Nursing. The word Nursing is
derived from a verb: an action. This suggests that nursing is an
active process: it involves actually caring for a person. <p>

Accordingly, when one studies to become a nurse, one goes to a school
of nursing, or a nursing department. Contrast this to other areas of
study. People who learn biology don't go to a school of
biologying. There's no verb form of the word biology. Similarly, you
learn art at an art school, not a school of arting. <p>

So I tend to think of human ecology like nursing--there is no human 
ecology without someone actually doing it. We should be a school of
human ecologying, except that it sounds silly, and would be even
harder to explain than human ecology. <p>

So if someone asks you what human ecology is, I'd first try the trick
making them define art before you'll talk to them. Once that gambit
has run its course, you can comment on how human ecology should really
be a noun form of a verb. And you could mention that noun forms of
verbs are called gerunds, whereas adjective forms of verbs are known
as gerundives. Gerunds and gerundives are the same in English, but
they're different in Latin. This should cause enough confusion that
the initial question about human ecology will be long forgotten, again
buying you some time. <p>

So, even if you still can't give a snappy definition of human ecology,
you know what part of speech it is--it's a gerund! <p>
 
<h3>Action-Oriented</h3> In determining what part of speech Human
Ecology is, we've come across the first of four essential and
distinctive features of human ecology. Human ecology is
action-oriented; it's about doing. Human ecology at COA not only
teaches students about environmental and social problems, but prepares
students to directly address these problems, at levels ranging from
local to international. 


<h3>Interdisciplinary</h3> The second important feature of human
ecology is its interdisciplinarity. At COA we recognize that, in
finding solutions to environmental and social problems, one usually
has to use knowledge, methods, techniques, and skills from a range of
disciplines. The environmental and social problems facing us are
complex; no single discipline has the answer. Also, we expect that
students will make connections between disciplines that we faculty
could never make on our own. As such sort of interdisciplinarity is
stronger than that of most liberal arts colleges. <p>

For example, at the liberal arts college I attended, I studied
literature in addition to physics and mathematics. But no one expected
me to combine literature and mathematics. But that sort of
combination, and countless others, happen all the time at COA. For
example, last spring I taught a class on chaos and fractals. Students
had to do a final project of their choosing. Amanda chose to make a
experimental documentary video about mathematical and natural
fractals. She had taken several video classes, and was enrolled in one
at the same time as she was taking my math class. The project was
entirely her conception-- I didn't suggest it and I certainly 
couldn't help her with the details of video making. She took the
initiative, and took some risks, and made connections between classes
that her video professor or I never could have made alone. This is
what we mean when we say that COA is interdisciplinary. It's not just
that one particular class is 
interdisciplinary--interdisciplinarity is woven into the 
entire fabric of the school and the students are as responsible as the
faculty for it. <p>

<h3>Self-Directed </h3>
A third feature of human ecology is that it is self-directed. There
are few curricular requirements. You will each consciously and
reflectively design your own course of study. Your class choices will
be yours, your internship will be yours, and your senior project will
be yours. 

But there's more to it than just having greater choice in your classes
than you're used to. A useful metaphor to explore this idea is found
in a passage from an Antonio Machado poem: 
<blockquote>
Wanderer, your footsteps are the path, and nothing more. Wanderer,
there is no path. We make the path by walking. 
</blockquote>
At COA, and in much of life, there aren't always set paths; there
aren't majors or tracks that you can plug into and then tune out. If
we're going to truly wrestle with the problems of the world, we'll
have to make paths as we go. And if our education is going to truly
help us come alive--transform us so we can transform the world--we
need to play an active role. At times, we'll need to make it up as we
go along, and remember that moving forward isn't the same thing as
moving straight. <p>

Machado's poem could possibly be read in a way that suggests a certain
individualism--that it's just you, alone in the cold world, 
boldly making a path somewhere. But I don't think this is what he 
means--Machado says "we make the path" not "you make the path." And 
it's certainly not what I want to suggest. So if you're not a solitary
learner moving through a void, what are you? What are you making a
path through or in or with? <p>

Some possible answers to this question are provided by Gary Snyder in
his extraordinary essay, Tawny Grammar. He writes: 
<blockquote>
American society (like any other) has its own set of unquestioned
assumptions. It still maintains a largely uncritical faith in the
notion of continually unfolding progress. It cleaves to the idea that
there can be unblemished scientific objectivity. And most
fundamentally it operates under the delusion 
that we are each a kind of "solitary knower" -- that we exist as 
rootless intelligences without layers of localized contexts. Just a
"self" and the "world." In this there is no real recognition that
grandparents, place, grammar, pets, friends, lovers, children, tools,
the poems and songs we remember, are what we think with. 
</blockquote>

I think that when COA is at its best, it's because we're providing all
sorts of things to think with. We--the faculty and staff, but also your
fellow students--provide lush surroundings--gardens and jungles,
forests and cities, fairylands and dreamscapes--through which you can
make your own paths.<p> 

<h3>Values and Love</h3> The last of the key components of human
ecology that I wish to talk about are values; human ecology is a
deeply value-driven endeavor. This is something that the faculty
sometimes get uncomfortable talking about. It's hard to say where
values come from. Is kindness biological? What is the root of empathy
or passion or love? Is there a religious or a spiritual source to
values? Many of us--particularly the scientists--come from academic
backgrounds in which such questions are simply never raised. As a
result, we don't talk about values as often as I think we should. <p>


But values drive much of what we do here. I think most faculty believe
that COA is a good school; good in that it's a high quality academic
institution, but also good in the sense that COA is a force for good
and positive change in the world. This is why I chose to come here to
teach. I didn't want to teach future engineers and doctors; teaching
future human ecologists is, to me, a higher calling.<p> 

It's hard to find precise words for the value-driven component of
human ecology. At its essence is a deep caring and a profound sense of
responsibility for humans and the environment. This is stated nicely
in the college's vision statement: 
<blockquote>
The faculty, students, trustees, staff, and alumni of College of the
Atlantic envision a world where people value creativity, intellectual
achievement, and diversity of nature and human cultures. With respect
and compassion, individuals construct meaningful lives for themselves,
gain appreciation for the relationships among all forms of life, and
safeguard the heritage of future generations. 
</blockquote> 
What is the value that's hiding in these words? I've thought about it
a lot, and perhaps the best word for it is love, defined variously as
"warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion", "affection based on
admiration and benevolence" or "unselfish, loyal, and benevolent
concern for the good of another." <p>

What does love have to do with education? For educator and philosopher
Paulo Friere, education and love are tightly linked. He writes: 
<blockquote>
We must dare, in the full sense of the word, to speak of love without
the fear of being called ridiculous, mawkish, or unscientific, if not
antiscientific. We must dare in order to say scientifically, and not
as mere blah-blah-blah, that we study, we learn, we teach, we know
with our entire body. We do all of these things with feeling, with
emotion, with wishes, with fear, with doubts, with passion, and also
with critical reasoning. However, we never study, learn, teach, or
know with [critical reasoning] only. We must ... never dichotomize
cognition and emotion. 
</blockquote>
Like Snyder, Friere rejects the idea of an isolated, "solitary
knower", a "rootless intelligence". A truly transformative education
is one in which passion and intellect are joined and not segregated,
in which critical reasoning is paired with love, not set in opposition
to it.<p> 

Ernesto "Che" Guevara also writes of love. And like Friere, he also
worries that it will seem ridiculous. As he writes in "Notes for the
Study of Man and Socialism in Cuba:" 
<blockquote>
At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true
revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible
to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality. ... One must
have a great deal of humanity and a strong sense of justice and truth
in order not to fall into extreme dogmatism and cold
scholasticism... . We must strive every day so that this love of
living humanity will be transformed into actual deeds, into acts that
serve as examples, as a moving force. 
</blockquote>

Justice and truth, fueled by love, transformed into action. Sounds
like human ecology to me.<p> 

But what's revolutionary about love? In brief, everything. For once
you love something or someone: your parents, your children, or all
children, the forest you grew up in, or all forests, or the planet,
the question changes from "what will you do to protect it" to "what
won't you do?"<p> 

The CrimethInc collective, in their manifesto "Days of War, Nights of
Love" discuss further the revolutionary character of love. When
listening to this passage, I think it's important to bear in mind
simultaneously several different sorts of love, not just romantic or
erotic love. So your sweetheart could be a man or woman you know, but
it could also be John Coltrane or Virginia Wolfe, or your love of
painting or gardening or mathematics, or your God or Goddess, or your
love of Acadia National Park or your hometown.  They write:
<blockquote>

Falling in love is the ultimate act of revolution, of resistance to
today's tedious, socially restrictive, culturally constrictive,
patently ridiculous world. <p>

Love transforms the world. ... In this sense love is subversive,
because it poses a threat to the established order of our modern
lives. <p>

The lover can see that it might be more worthwhile to hitchhike to
Alaska (or to sit in the park and watch the clouds sail by) with her
sweetheart than to study for her calculus exam or sell real estate. <p>

Love poses a threat to our political system, for it is difficult to
convince a man who has a lot to live for in his personal relationships
to be willing to fight and die for an abstraction such as the state;
for that matter, it may be difficult to convince him to pay taxes. <p>

For it is love that gives meaning to life, desire that makes it
possible for us to make sense of our existence and find purpose in our
lives. So fall in love today, with men, with women, with music, with
ambition, with yourself...with life! <p>

One might say that it is ridiculous to implore others to fall in
love...it is not a choice that can be made consciously. Emotions do
not follow the instructions of the rational mind. But the environment
in which we must live out our lives has a great influence on our
emotions, and we can make decisions that effect this environment. It
should be possible to work to change an environment that is hostile to
love into an environment that encourages it. Our task must be to
engineer our world so that it is a world in which people can and do
fall in love. 
</blockquote>

This, in my view, is the task of COA--your task, our task--to engineer
the world so that it is one in which people can and do fall in
love. Or, to use Che Guavara's phrase, to transform our love of living
humanity into actual deeds, a moving force.<p> 

Such work isn't easy. It's a lot harder than choosing a major and then
letting professors tell you what to learn and how to think. Learning
to change the world is harder than learning how to maintain the status
quo. Learning how to love is harder than learning how to not love.<p>

But I suspect that you chose to come here because you know all
 this. Because you are looking for important, hard work. Because you
 know that the world needs you. Because you know--as do I--that you
 can make a difference, even
if you aren't sure how just yet. Because you know that a better world
 is not certain, but it's possible--and you want to do all you can to
 improve the odds. <p>

Let us work to give life to our hopes as well as our fears. And let us
use our idealism to inspire us to action. On this, historian Howard
Zinn writes: 
<blockquote>
To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based
on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but
also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness... And if we do act,
in however small a way, we don't have to wait for some grand utopian
future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live
now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is
bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory. 
</blockquote>

College of the Atlantic has already played a part in countless such
marvelous victories over its thirty-five year history. And I have no
doubt that countless such marvelous victories lie ahead, for you, and
for all of us. <p>

So human ecology is many things in addition to being a gerund. It's
human, humane, and humanizing. It's challenging, difficult,
occasionally frightening, but joyous and hopeful all at the same
time. Human ecology is a strongly interdisciplinary, radically
self-directed style of education. It's hard work, and it's fun. But
perhaps most importantly, human ecology is a way of learning, acting,
being, and doing that is based on a marriage of the strongest of our
intellectual and aesthetic traditions with a deep, revolutionary love
for all life. <p>

Welcome to the College of the Atlantic, and welcome to Human
Ecology. Thank you. <p>
