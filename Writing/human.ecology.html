<i>This essay is a version of a talk I gave to the entering students
at the <a href="http://www.coa.edu">College of the Atlantic</a>,
September 8, 2003.</i><p><br>


<P>
I've thought a lot about what I want to talk about with you this morning.
In so doing, I oscillated between two extremes.  Sometimes, I find
want to tell you everything at once--all that makes this place
wonderful and different and important.  The rest of the time, I wonder
why I should tell you anything.  I've read your applications, and I
know you all are, in various combinations, passionate and creative and
smart and well prepared and alive and loving and feeling.  So you'll
all be fine.  

<P><br>

<H1>What is human ecology?</H1>

<P>
So what I decided to do is say a few things about the academic
philosophy at COA known as human ecology.  This isn't the last word,
by any means, on what human ecology is or should be, but they're ideas
that I've thought about in my five years here, and I've found them
useful as I try continually to figure out what I'm doing at the
wonderful but different little college.  Perhaps these ideas will be
of some use to you as you begin your own human ecology journey.  Or,
perhaps you'll tell me in a few days or a few years that I've got it
all wrong.  Either outcome would be fine by me.

<P>
So, what is human ecology?  
<p><br>

<h3>Don't worry about the definition</A></h3>

<P>
My first response is: don't worry about the definition of human
ecology too much.  It's something that sometimes first year students
get angsty about, but there's no need.  For one, there are lots of
things that we study and strive toward that we can't define.  But this
doesn't invalidate these as ideas or ideals.  For example, who can
define how to be a good son or daughter, or a good parent, a good
citizen, a good partner?  But that doesn't stop us from striving
toward these things, or making these any less real or important.
Definitions aren't always that useful.

<P>
Also, almost all areas of study are difficult to define.  Try coming
up with a definition of mathematics, art, or poetry.
But part of the problem is is that these words--mathematics, art,
poetry--are used all the time, while human ecology is relatively 
uncommon.  So it's inevitable that you'll be asked what it is,
especially by parents and friends at other schools.  So one response
is to turn the question around--tell your parents that you'll
explain human ecology as soon as they provide a definition of art.  
This should buy you some time.

<P><br>

<h3>It's not a thing</A></h2>

<P>
A second point about human ecology.
It's not a thing.  In my opinion--one which is not shared by all at
COA--human ecology is not a discrete ``lump'' of knowledge sitting
out there somewhere.  An essential part of human ecology is action:
doing and making and changing, not just learning.

<P>
In this sense Human Ecology is like Nursing.  The word Nursing is
derived from a verb: an action.  This suggests that nursing is an 
active process: it involves actually caring for a person.  It involves
agency; a person really doing it.

<P>
Accordingly, when one studies to become a nurse, one goes to a school
of nursing, or a nursing department.  Contrast this to other areas of
study.  People who learn biology don't go to a school of biologying.
There's no verb form of the word biology.  Similarly,
you learn art at an art school, not a school of arting.  

<P>
So I tend to think of human ecology like nursing--there is no human
ecology without someone actually doing it.  We should be a school of
human ecologying, except that it sounds silly, and would be even
harder to explain than human ecology.

<P>
So if someone asks you what human ecology is, I'd first try the trick
making them define art before you'll talk to them.  Once that gambit
has run its course, you can comment on how human ecology should really
be a noun form of a verb.  And you could mention that noun forms of
verbs are called gerunds, whereas adjective forms of verbs are known
as gerundives. Gerunds and gerundives are the same in English, but
they're different in Latin.  This should cause enough confusion that
the initial question about human ecology will be long forgotten, again
buying you some time.

<P>
So, even if you still can't give a snappy definition of human ecology,
you know what part of speech it is--it's a gerund!  

<P>
One additional point about the similarities between nursing and
human ecology(ing).  Nursing is definitely about doing.  But it
doesn't mean that there's nothing to learn, or that you can just do
any old thing.  There are most definitely bodies of knowledge that you
need to master to be a good nurse.  But the point is to master this
knowledge and then do something with it.  Human ecology is the same in
this respect.  As Alfred North Whitehead says, ``The aim of education
is the acquisition of the art of the utilization of knowledge.''

<P><br>

<H1>Action-Oriented</A>
</H1>

<P>
In determining what part of speech Human Ecology is, we've come across
the first of four essential and distinctive features of human
ecology.  Human ecology is action-oriented; it's about doing. Human
ecology at COA not only teaches students about environmental and
social problems, but prepares students to directly address these
problems, at levels ranging from local to international.  

<P><br>

<H1>Interdisciplinary</A>
</H1>

<P>
The second important feature of human ecology is its
interdisciplinarity.  At COA we recognize that, in finding solutions
to environmental and social problems, one usually has to use knowledge,
methods, techniques, and skills from a range of disciplines.  The
environmental and social problems facing us are complex; no single
discipline has the answer.  Also, we expect that students will make
connections between disciplines that we faculty could never make on
our own.  As such sort of interdisciplinarity is stronger than that of
most liberal arts colleges.   

<P>
For example, at the liberal arts college I attended, I studied
literature in addition to physics and mathematics.  But no one expected
me to <EM>combine</EM> literature and mathematics.  But that sort of
combination, and countless others, happen all the time at COA.  A
particularly noteworthy example of this was one term when a former
student, Rita Turner, took an advanced chaos math class from me, a
class on video making from Nancy Andrews, and a class on curriculum
design from a visiting professor.  Amazingly, Rita used ideas and
themes from my math class in one of the videos she produced and also
in the high school English curriculum she designed.  Rita's professors
could have never made these connections.

<P>
So Human Ecology is strongly interdisciplinary in this sense.

<P><br>

<h1>Self-Directed</h1>

<P>
A third feature of human ecology is that it is self-directed.  There
are few curricular requirements.  You will each consciously and
reflectively design your own course of study.  Your class choices will
be yours, your internship will be yours, and your senior project will
be yours.

<P>
But there's more to it than just having greater choice in your classes
than you're used to.  A useful metaphor to explore this idea is found
in a passage from an Antonio Machado poem:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Wanderer, your footsteps are the path, and nothing more.
Wanderer, there is no path.  We make the path by walking.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
At COA, and in much of life, there aren't always set paths; there
aren't majors or tracks that you can plug into and then tune out.  If
we're going to truly wrestle with the problems of the world, we'll
have to make paths as we go.  And if our education is going to truly
help us come alive--transform us so we can transform the world--we
need to play an active role.  At times, we'll need to make it up as we
go along, and remember that moving forward isn't the same thing as
moving straight. 

<P>
Machado's poem could possibly be read in a way that suggests a certain
individualism--that it's just you, alone in the cold world, boldly
making a path somewhere.  But I don't think this is what he
means--Machado says ``<EM>we</EM> make the path'' not ``<EM>you</EM>
make the path''.  And it's certainly not what I want to suggest.  So
if you're not a solitary learner moving through a void, what are you?
What are you making a path through or in or with?

<P>
Some possible answers to this question are provided by Gary Snyder in
his extraordinary essay, Tawny Grammar.  He writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
American society (like any other) has its own set of unquestioned
assumptions.  It still maintains a largely uncritical faith in the
notion of continually unfolding progress.  It cleaves to the idea that
there can be unblemished scientific objectivity.  And most
fundamentally it operates under the delusion that we are each a kind
of ``solitary knower'' -- that we exist as rootless intelligences
without layers of localized contexts.  Just a ``self'' and the
``world.''  In this there is no real recognition that grandparents,
place, grammar, pets, friends, lovers, children, tools, the poems and
songs we remember, are what we <EM>think with</EM>.  Such a solitary mind
-- if it could exist -- would be a boring prisoner of abstractions.
<EM>With no surroundings there can be no path, and with no path one
cannot be free.</EM>  [emphasis in original.]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I think that when COA is at its best, it's because we're providing all
sorts of things to think with.  We-the faculty and staff, but also
the students--provide lush surroundings--gardens and jungles, forests
and cities, fairylands and dreamscapes--through which you can make
your own paths. 

<P><br>

<H1>Values and Love</A>
</H1>

<P>
The last key components of human ecology that I wish to talk about are
values; human ecology is a deeply value-driven endeavor.  This is
something that the faculty sometimes get uncomfortable talking
about.  But, in reading your application essays, it's clear that
you're not uncomfortable talking about values.  Almost all of your
essays touched on questions of value: morality, justice, fairness,
right and wrong.  

<P>
Nevertheless, values are tricky to talk about for several reasons.
For one, it's hard to say where values come from.  Is kindness
biological?  What is the root of empathy or passion or love?  Is there
a religious or a spiritual source to values?  Many of us--particularly
the scientists--come from academic backgrounds in which such
questions are rarely raised, and almost never answered.  As a result,
we don't talk about values as often as I think we should.

<P>
But, at base, values drive much of what we do here.  I think most
faculty believe that COA is a good school; good in that it's a high
quality academic institution, but also good in the sense that COA is a
force for good and positive change in the world.
This is why I chose to come here to teach.  I didn't want to teach
future engineers and doctors; teaching future human ecologists is, to
me, a higher calling.

<P>
A second reason that values are potentially troublesome is that so
many of them seem to be contextual or culturally dependent.  This is a
huge and difficult question, and I'll only touch on it very briefly.
The dilemma is that once we allow that some values are different in
different contexts, we 
may be tempted to slip into a nihilism in which relativism washes away
all moral distinctions.  But I believe that the choice between
universal values and a nihilistic relativism is a false dichotomy.
Donna Haraway argues this point forcefully in her essay Situated
Knowledges: The science question in feminism and the privilege of
partial perspective, admonishing us that ``social constructionism
cannot be allowed to decay into the radiant emanations of cynicism.''  

<P>
Nevertheless, I think there are some statements of values or ethics or
standards that are close to universal, in that they can be reasonably
applied across cultures.  One such statement is the Earth Charter,
adopted last year by COA's all college meeting in this same room in
which we now meet.  Another such statement is the United Nations
Declaration of Universal Human Rights.  

<P>
An additional aspect of the value-driven component of human ecology is
even more elusive and harder to find words for.  It's characterized by a
deep caring and a profound sense of responsibility for humans and the
environment.  This is stated nicely in the college's vision statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The faculty, students, trustees, staff, and alumni of College of the
Atlantic envision a world where people value creativity, intellectual
achievement, and diversity of nature and human cultures.  With respect
and compassion, individuals construct meaningful lives for themselves,
gain appreciation for the relationships among all forms of life, and
safeguard the heritage of future generations.  

</BLOCKQUOTE>
What is the value that's hiding in these words?  I've thought about it
a lot, and perhaps the best word for it is <EM>love</EM>, defined
variously as ``warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion'', ``affection
based on admiration and benevolence'' or ``unselfish, loyal, and
benevolent concern for the good of another.''  

<P>
Initially I was hesitant to discuss love in this way, but then I
recalled a passage written by Paulo Friere in ``Letters to those Who
Dare to Teach'' which has always resonated with me.  Friere writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must dare, in the full sense of the word, to speak of love without
the fear of being called ridiculous, mawkish, or unscientific, if not
antiscientific.  We must dare in order to say scientifically, and not
as mere blah-blah-blah, that we study, we learn, we teach, we know
with our entire body.  We do all of these things with feeling, with
emotion, with wishes, with fear, with doubts, with passion, and also
with critical reasoning.  However, we never study, learn, teach, or
know with [critical reasoning] only.  We must ... 
never dichotomize cognition and emotion. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Like Snyder, Friere rejects the idea of an isolated, ``solitary
knower'', a ``rootless intelligence''.  A truly transformative
education is one in which passion and intellect are joined and not
segregated, in which critical reasoning is paired with love, not set
in opposition to it.

<P>
Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara also writes of love.  And like Friere, he also
worries that it will seem ridiculous.  As he writes in ``Notes for the
Study of Man and Socialism in Cuba:'' 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true
revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible
to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One must have a great deal of humanity and a
strong sense of justice and truth in order not to fall into extreme
dogmatism and cold scholasticism... .
We must strive every day so that this love of living humanity
will be transformed into actual deeds, into acts that serve as
examples, as a moving force. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Justice and truth, fueled by love, transformed into action.  Sounds
like human ecology to me.  (Perhaps Che should be on the cover of our
next viewbook.  How many pictures of Max Woodfin and his bike do we
need?)  

<P>
But what's revolutionary about love?  In brief,
everything.  For once you love something or someone:  your parents,
your children, or all children, the forest you grew up in, or all
forests, or the planet, the question changes from ``what will you do
to protect it'' to ``what <EM>won't</EM> you do?''

<P>
The CrimethInc collective, in their manifesto ``Days of War, Nights of
Love'' discuss further the revolutionary character of love.  When
listening to this passage, I think it's important to bear in mind
simultaneously several different sorts of love, not just romantic or
erotic love.  So your sweetheart could be a man or woman you know, but
it could also be John Coltrane or Virginia Wolfe, or your love of
painting or gardening or mathematics, or your God or Goddess, or your
love of Acadia National Park or your hometown.  They write:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Falling in love is the ultimate act of revolution, of resistance to
today's tedious, socially restrictive, culturally constrictive,
patently ridiculous world.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Love transforms the world.  ...
In this sense love is subversive, because it poses a threat to the
established order of our modern lives.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lover can see that it might be more worthwhile to hitchhike to
Alaska (or to sit in the park and watch the clouds sail by) with her
sweetheart than to study for her calculus exam or sell real
estate...and if she decides that it is, she will have the courage to
do it, rather than be tormented by unsatisfied longing.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Love poses a threat to our political system, for it is difficult to
convince a man who has a lot to live for in his personal relationships
to be willing to fight and die for an abstraction such as the state;
for that matter, it may be difficult to convince him to pay taxes. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For it is love that gives meaning to life, desire that makes it
possible for us to make sense of our existence and find purpose in our
lives.  Without these, there is no way for us to determine how to
live our lives, except to submit to some authority, some ... master or
doctrine to tell us what to do and how to do it without
ever giving us the satisfaction that self-determination does.  So fall
in love today, with men, with women, with music, with ambition, with
yourself...with life!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One might say that it is ridiculous to implore others to fall in
love...it is not a choice that can be made consciously.  Emotions do
not follow the instructions of the rational mind.  But the environment
in which we must live out our lives has a great influence on our
emotions, and we can make decisions that effect this environment.  It
should be possible to work to change an environment that is hostile to
love into an environment that encourages it.  Our task must be to
engineer our world so that it is a world in which people can and do
fall in love.  

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I hope that College of the Atlantic is such a world for you.  Although
we don't talk often about it this way, I think that's what we have in
mind.  Sometimes we talk about saving the world.  But it's probably
necessary to fall in love with it first.

<P>
So human ecology is many things in addition to being a gerund.  
It's human, humane, and humanizing.  It's challenging, difficult,
occasionally frightening, but joyous and hopeful all at the same
time.  Human ecology is a strongly interdisciplinary, radically
self-directed style of education.  But perhaps most importantly, human
ecology is at its essence, a way of learning, acting, being, and doing
that is based on a marriage of the strongest of our intellectual
traditions with a deep, revolutionary love for all life.

<P>
Welcome to the College of the Atlantic, and welcome to Human Ecology.

<P>
Thank you.
