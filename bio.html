<p>David Feldman received a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in
  1991 and a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California at
  Davis in 1998.  From 1991-1993, he was a teacher of 9th and 10th
  grade physics and mathematics at The McCallie School in Chattanooga,
  TN.  As a graduate student at UC Davis, Dave received several awards
  in recognition of both teaching and scholarship:  The Dissertation
  Year Fellowship; The Chancellor's Teaching Fellowship; and he was
  nominated for the Outstanding Graduate Student Teaching Award.</p> 

<p>Dave joined the faculty at College of the Atlantic in 1998.  He
  served as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs from 2003-2007.  At COA
  Dave has taught over twenty different courses in physics, mathematics,
  and computer science.  Among these classes is <i>Introduction to Chaos
  and Fractals</i>, an introductory course for students with a preparation
  in algebra.  Dave has authored at textbook based on this
  class, <a href="http://chaos.coa.edu">Chaos and Fractals: An
  Elementary Introduction</a>. (Oxford University Press, 2012). 
</p> 

<p>Dave has recently become interested in teaching about renewable
  energy and energy conservation.  With Anna E. Demeo, a lecturer at
  COA in engineering, he has developed and team-taught an introductory
  course on the physics and mathematics of sustainable energy.  Anna
  and Dave received a $95,000 grant from the Maine Space Grant
  Consortium Research and Higher Education Program to support the
  development of the class.  Anna and Dave have also received an
  $18,000 grant from the Environmental Education Program of the
  Environmental Protection Agency to develop and teach a workshop on
  sustainable energy for area elementary school teachers.  This
  workshop will be held in the summer of 2011.</p>


<p>From 2004-2008, Dave gave a week-long series of lectures at the
  <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/">China
  Complex Systems Summer School</a> (CSSS), co-sponsored by the 
  <a href="http://www.santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</a> and the
  <a href="http://english.itp.cas.cn/">Institute of Theoretical
  Physics</a> at the  
  Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.  His lectures provided
  students with a broad introduction to complex systems, including
  dynamical systems, information theory, and computation theory.  From
  2006-2008 he was co-director of the China CSSS, collaborating with
  colleagues at the Chinese Academy to oversee all academic and
  logistical aspects of the program.  He was PI on a $116,000 grant
  from the U.S. National Science Foundation that partially supported
  the CSSS. </p>

<p>In 2011-12, Dave was a U.S. Fulbright Lecturer in Rwanda.  He held
  an appointment as a visiting professor of Applied Physics at the
  <a href="http://www.kist.ac.rw/index.php?id=2">Kigali Institute of
  Science and Technology</a> (KIST).  At KIST he taught four 
  classes for junior and senior physics majors: Computational Physics,
  Statistical Physics, Mathematical Physics II, and Atomic and
  Molecular Physics.  He also taught an introductory physics course to
  180 chemistry, biology, and food science majors.  </p>

<p>Dave's research interests lie in the fields of statistical
  mechanics and nonlinear dynamics.  In particular, his research has
  examined how one might measure "complexity" or pattern in a
  mathematical system, and how such complexity is related to disorder.
  This work belongs to the constellation of research topics often
  referred to as "chaos and complex systems."  In his research, Dave
  uses both analytic and computational techniques.  Dave has authored
  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwyYMbUAAAAJ&hl=en">research
  papers</a> in journals including Physical Review E, Chaos, and  
  Advances in Complex Systems.</p>
 
<p>His other interests include ultimate frisbee, hockey, cooking,
  travel, brewing beer, and gardening.  He is married to Doreen
  Stabinsky; they have three excellent cats.</p>
