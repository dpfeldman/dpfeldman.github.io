You might also want to look at a set of <a href="Tutorial/index.html">
lecture notes </a> that I developed.  These should provide a moderately 
gentle introduction to the theoretical tools I use in my research.<p>

My research has been carried out with the collaboration of
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu:80/~jpc/"> Jim Crutchfield</a>.  
An <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/projects/CompMech/"> archive </a> 
of work done by him and his <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/projects/CompMech/html/CompMechGroup.html"> 
group </a>is available.<p>

It also seems as if <a href="complexity.dilbert.gif"> Dilbert </a> has
been doing some work in this area. <img src="dilbert.gif">
