I live with <a
href="http://arcticsunrise.coa.edu/doreen"> Doreen
Stabinsky</a>. She teaches half time at the College of the Atlantic and is also 
a science advisor to <a
href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org">Greenpeace USA</a>.<p>

She is good to live with because she feeds the cats, cooks starchy
yet nutritious foods, and does some housework about once a month. She is also 
my best friend.<p>

We're actually married now.  A capitulation to the heterosexist patriarchy?  
Well, yes.  But it's good for insurance and making sure we could see 
each other if one of us ever got mangled up and sent to the hospital.  We
got married on Dec. 21, the darkest day of the year.  So far married life
has been almost identical to unmarried life.
