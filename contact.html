By far the best way to reach me is via email.  My address is dfeldman AT
 coa D0T edu.  My mailing address and phone are:
</p>
<blockquote>
David Feldman<br>
College of the Atlantic<br>
105 Eden Street<br>
Bar Harbor, ME 04609 USA<br>
+1 207 801.5709 (office)<br>
+1 207 288.4126 (fax)
</blockquote>

<p>My office on campus is on the second floor of the turrets annex.  
COA doesn't number its offices.
</p>

<p>If you want to set up a time to meet the best thing to do is to
  check my <a href="./calendar">schedule</a> and then send me an email
  suggesting a few times.  You're also welcome to stop
  by any time I'm on campus if you have a quick question or if you
  want to schedule a time to meet later.  Email usually works better
  for me than voicemail.</b>

<!--<p><b>Email reality check:</b> I try very hard to answer all email that
  I get, but I don't always 
  succeed.  I'll answer all COA email, of course, but I can't always
  get to new correspondence.  I wish I could, but I just don't have
  the time.  I do read all email that I get.  If you have a question
  about COA or my research, it is more likely that I'll be able to
  respond if it is a question that can be answered with a fairly short
  response.
  -->
<!--  I don't want to discourage you from writing &mdash; I
  enjoy getting emails that aren't spam.  I just can't promise that
  I'll answer every email that I get.   -->
