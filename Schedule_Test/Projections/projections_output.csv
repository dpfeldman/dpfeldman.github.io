HS2123,W26,"Jacoby, Franklin",Our Life with Words: Philosophies of Language,,I/M,"What is language? What is the relationship between language and thought? Between language and experience? What is meaning? These are some of the central questions of the philosophy of language. They are fundamental not only to large portions to modern philosophy, but also linguistics, computer science and other fields. This course will explore some of the key theories and criticisms that philosophers have developed in answer to these questions about our life with words.

In this course, we will take a historical approach and work our way to the present, exploring classic theories of meaning and language from the early modern period and early analytic philosophers, such as Mill, Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and others. Then we will examine criticisms that philosophers have raised over the years, both from texts in the analytic tradition as well as other positions from, for example, ordinary language philosophy, continental approaches. Students will acquire an understanding of those central problems in the philosophy of language; they will also develop philosophical skills in analysing texts, articulating arguments, and presenting complex philosophical material through writing and oral presentations.

HS3035,W26,"Friedlander, Jay",Sustainable Strategies,,M,"Business has tremendous societal ramifications. Inventions and industries from the automobile to the internet impact everything from air quality to economic and political freedom.  Entrepreneurs, who are often at the forefront of business and thus societal innovation, are changing the way business is conducted by creating businesses that are beneficial to the bottom line, society and the environment.  Through cases, projects and present day examples, the course will challenge students to understand the impact of business on society and the challenges and pitfalls of creating a socially responsible venture.  In addition, it will offer new frameworks for creating entrepreneurial ventures that capitalize on social responsibility to gain competitive advantage, increase valuation while benefiting society and the environment.  The final deliverable for the course is an in-class presentation in which student teams will either: (1) recommend ways to improve the social and environmental impacts of a company, while increasing competitive advantage and bottom line; or (2) benchmark two industry competitors, a socially responsible company versus a traditional company.

HS2076,W26,"Donovan, Martha","Life Stories: Memory, Family, and Place",,I/M,"One of the deepest human instincts is to tell our life stories, to figure out who we are. This course will use a workshop approach with a particular focus on memoir writing rooted in an exploration of family and place. We will study the writing process and matters of craft by reading and responding to memoirs by contemporary writers (e.g., Terry Tempest Williams’ When Women Were Birds: Fifty-Four Variations on Voice), a practical guide to memoir writing (Judith Barrington's Writing the Memoir), and essays on memoir and memory (e.g., Patricia Hampl’s I Could Tell You Stories: Sojourns in the Land of Memory). Class time will include discussion of readings, writing exercises designed to help students with matters of language and technique in their own writing, and group critiques of work-in-progress. Student work will be shared through a class reading and the production of a chapbook of one of their stories. Students will be evaluated on the effort and quality of their writing, their commitment to the writing process, their participation in peer review and workshops, a final portfolio of all their writing, and their class reading of finished work.

HS2087,W26,"Collum, Kourtney",Transforming Food Systems,,I/M,"This course explores possibilities for transformative change across local and global food systems.  The course centers on the questions: What would it take to ensure access to healthy, safe, affordable, culturally appropriate foods for all people? The first part of the course critically examines capitalist food systems with particular attention to the ways culture, politics, and economics shape our interactions with food. Through readings and exercises, we explore issues such as nutrition, worker safety, contested agricultural and land use policies, hunger, and environmental and community health. The second part of the course examines case studies of transformative food movements around the world, from the Zero Hunger programs in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to La Via Campesina global campaign for agrarian reform. We focus particularly on food sovereignty and agroecology movements. The final third of the course focuses on transformative work in Maine and at COA. Students take multiple field trips to participate in local movements and to learn about their philosophies, objectives, and activities. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze how power shapes food systems and articulate a theory of change for addressing a food systems problem of their choice. Students are evaluated based on participation in class discussions and field trips, a series of reflection papers, and a final project including a paper and an audio-visual presentation.

HS3031,W26,"Cline, Ken","Our Public Lands: Past, Present, and Future",,M,"By definition ""public lands"" belong to all of us, yet public lands in this country have a history of use (and abuse) by special interests and a shocking absence of any coherent management strategy for long-term sustainability.  This course is taught in seminar format in which students read and discuss several environmental policy and history texts that concern the history and future of our federal lands.  We also use primary historic documents and texts to understand the origins of public ownership and management.  We examine the legal, philosophical, ecological, and political problems that have faced our National Parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public lands.  An effort is made to sort out the tangle of laws and conflicting policies that govern these public resources.  Special attention is given to the historic roots of current policy debates.  Evaluation is based upon response papers, a class presentation, participation in class discussions, and a group project looking closely at the historical context and policy implications of a management issue facing a nearby public land unit.

HS3070,W26,"Cline, Ken",Native American Law,,M,"From first contact through the confrontation surrounding the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Dakota Access Pipeline, Native American law has tried to reconcile two incommensurate legal systems and widely varying government policies.  This course examines the evolution of federal Native American or ""Indian"" Law from colonization onward as impacted by treaties, executive orders, congressional enactments, and major U.S. Supreme Court cases interpreting the U.S. Constitution and statutes as they involve Native American legal issues. This is not a class about tribal law or the indigenous legal systems that exist among the various tribes in the US.  Rather, it examines the legal system imposed on tribes from the outside; a system that has evolved over time and creates the legal framework which tribes operate under today. Students will gain an understanding of law as a policy tool and framework, and acquire the necessary skills to work on policy issues affecting native peoples.  We will focus on primary legal material as well as secondary interpretations of that material.  There will be some comparative law analysis from other countries and an examination of how the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples relates to US practices.  Students will complete several analytical problem sets that require an application of course concepts to fact scenarios as well as a major paper on a legal topic of their choosing.  A class visit to a Maine reservation will allow conversation with tribal leaders involved with current environmental and Native American issues in Maine.  

Level: Intermediate.  Prerequisites: None beyond proficiency in college-level reading, writing, critical thinking, and research skills; however, Indigenous America is strongly recommended. Class limit: 20.  Lab fee: $35.  Meets the following degree requirements: HS",
ED1016,W26,"Hill, Ken",Intro to Adolescent Psychology,,I,"This course focuses on the segment of the human life span from puberty to early adulthood.  In this class we will examine the physical, cognitive, social, and moral aspects of adolescent growth and development.  Issues to be considered include adolescent relationships (peers, family, romantic), adolescent issues (identity formation, at risk behavior, schooling, and stereotypes), and critical reflection on one's own adolescent experience. The main objectives of this course are to: 1) provide students with a working knowledge of the theories of psychology which pertain to early adolescent development; 2) help students develop the ability to critically analyze information and common assumptions about the development of adolescents; 3) consider contemporary issues and concerns of the field; and 4) to afford students the opportunity to explore their own adolescent development.  Course work entails lecture, discussion, extensive case analysis, and a field component.

ED1023,W26,"Fuller, Linda",Teaching as an Act of Hope,,I,"In a world marked by complexity, uncertainty, and diverse challenges, the role of teachers extends far beyond the transmission of knowledge. Students in this course will explore the question of what helps certain teachers to bring a continual sense of hope to their professional practice despite often relatively low pay, long hours, negative attention during political clashes, and increasing stressors on youth and society that inevitably appear in the classroom. Why do people choose to teach? And what keeps them in the classroom? How do teachers experience the impact of various education-focused policies on their efforts, and what are some ways teachers navigate and influence policy to maintain their visions for successful schools? Through critical readings, podcasts, guest speakers, small group interviews, and classroom observations students will reflect on how teachers bring and maintain hope in their learning communities. Students can expect to speak with area teachers as well as education experts from a variety of realms, and texts will include choices from authors such as Patrick Harris II, bell hooks, John Dewey, Regie Routman, Parker Palmer, and Nel Noddings. Final projects will allow students to creatively share their learning with one another and with teachers whose ideas have been most influential in their growing understanding of this realm of world-changing efforts. This course is suitable for future teachers or those considering teaching as well as education enthusiasts and anyone interested in the profound impact of education on society.

ES2012,W26,"Todd, Sean",Intro to Statistics and Research Design,,I/M,"This course introduces the basics of statistical analysis that can be used in either a scientific or a social science frame of reference.  While this course teaches you to perform both nonparametric and simple parametric analysis both by hand and computer, an emphasis will be placed on understanding the principles and assumptions of each test, rather than mathematical ability per se.  We will also learn how to report statistical results in journal format, and there will be plenty of lab time to sharpen skills.  Evaluation is based on lab participation, three quizzes, and a team project.

ES1092,W26,"Slabach, Brittany",Collecting Nature: Exploration of Scientific Collection,,I,"Natural history collections are important artifacts that provide pivotal information on the past, present, and future of our natural world. They document species ecology and distribution, changes in aspects of phenotypes, and aid in conservation initiatives. Collections have tremendous value in understanding and documenting our natural and cultural world. Yet their history, and the practice of scientific collecting, is muddled with bias, controversy, and colonial practices. Through discussion and practice, we will explore the science and art of scientific collecting, preparing, and caring for specimens (plant and animal). We will discuss the history of scientific collections, and collection practices, and consider their role and value. We will visit natural history museums, their collections, and the curators that care for them. Thus, there are two required field trips, including one overnight. We will also practice the art of specimen preparation and care, learning different preparation and cataloging techniques. This class is open to anyone with any interest or curiosity about natural history museums, collections or scientific collecting. It is recommended for students interested in museology techniques or those interested in pursuing careers in museum studies. Assessments include written responses to weekly prompts, discussion participation, written essays, and a term project.

ES1052,W26,"Letcher, Susan",Biology: Cellular Processes of Life,,I,"This course introduces students to the molecular and cellular processes that are essential for life.  We will initially cover some basic chemistry to develop a common language for discussing the complex molecular events that are the basis of the structure and function of cells.  This class will explore cellular processes involved in metabolism, communication, growth, and reproduction.  There is a strong emphasis on the understanding the genetic basis of these processes as well as how these processes are controlled, and we will delve into the structure and function of the DNA molecule in some detail.  We will examine how our understanding of genetic processes and genome sequencing has led to applications in research, medicine, agriculture, and industry, with time also devoted to discussion of the social and ethical consequences attached to these technological innovations.  Students will be evaluated on participation, performance on problem sets and quizzes throughout the term, and a final oral presentation.

ES1081,W26,"Letcher, Susan",Plants and People: Economic Botany,,I,"This class offers an introduction to plant biology centered around plants that are useful to human societies. We will explore plant anatomy, physiology, evolution, and ecology through case studies involving plants that are useful to humans. Through lectures, readings, and discussions, students will gain a rich understanding of how plants function and how human societies depend on them in myriad ways. We will cover universal and familiar uses of plants such as food, building materials, and textiles, as well as less widely practiced uses including arrow poisons, lacquers, and living fences. We will discuss the origins of agriculture and methods of plant breeding, as well as the biogeographical history of important cultivated plant lineages. The focus will be on plants and our uses for them, but we will also discuss ethical concerns surrounding practices like bioprospecting and ex situ conservation. Students will be evaluated on participation and the successful completion of two presentations and a research paper.

MD4013,W26,"Hall, Sarah",Demons from the Depths,,M/A,"Across a range of epochs, cultures, and territories, human beings have proffered myths, stories, and scientific theories in order to explain catastrophic natural events. From kata=down, strephein=turn, the Greek katastrephein meant ""under-turning"" in the ancient world. This course explores postulations regarding large- and small-scale calamitous events that seem to originate from below the surface of Earth. Our enquiry engages with legendary tales, historical records, material culture and scientific discourses that document attempts to explain the meaning and/or mechanism of such memorable episodes. What causes a mountain to eject ash and toxic gases? What infernal force creates lava flow? Why does the earth shake? Why do some natural waters cause harm? How do we understand that which we cannot see? Through case-studies informed by the literature of science, the arts and humanities, we will plumb the depths and limits of the human imagination. This class uses both a lecture-based and seminar-style discussion approach as well as time spent visiting local lab and field sites. Students will be evaluated based on their weekly activities and writing assignments, and a final project with both oral and written presentation components.

Level: Intermediate/Advanced.  Prerequisites: At least one previous class in either art history or literature is required; an additional class in, or knowledge of, geoscience is strongly suggested.

HS1065,W26,"Lakey, Heather",Philosophy of Good and Evil,,I,"Good and evil are timeless topics and they have motivated centuries of philosophical thinking. Although the terms “good” and “evil” are commonly used across a range of discourses, they are ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In an effort to explore different ideas about good and evil, this course provides a broad overview of the issues, arguments, and debates that shape philosophical ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What are the origins of good and evil? What makes an action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What should we do with someone who commits a horrific act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? What kinds of ethical theories operate without the concepts of good and evil? Is evil an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of good and evil help or hinder moral thinking?

To critically unpack these questions, we will read works by ethical thinkers including Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, Hannah Arendt, Zhuangzi, Simone de Beauvoir, Abû Nasr al-Fârâbî, Nell Noddings, Peter Singer, Kwame Gyekye, Mencius, Sherman Alexie, and others. Along the way, we will study deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, ethical relativism, feminist ethics, Taoism, and existential ethics. In addition, we will unpack the ethical arguments that orbit concrete topics such as execution, murder, moral character, racial injustice, and our ethical duties to one another.

This course will familiarize students with the influential frameworks of ethical philosophy, and it will encourage students to apply these frameworks to specific ethical problems. Course requirements include class participation, three short papers, a reflection essay, and a final paper or project. There are no prerequisites for this course, but students should be prepared to engage with difficult, philosophical texts and to discuss these texts in class.

HS1075,W26,"Lakey, Heather",Animals and Ethics,,I,"What are our moral obligations to other animals? Should non-human animals have legal rights and moral standing? If so, on what basis? How does the moral treatment of animals change across the contexts of food, research, captivity, and the home? Historically, western philosophers construct the animal in opposition to the human. Why? What is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted with it? How does language shape and produce our relationships with animals? How is the animal represented and characterized, and how does this representation impact our thinking about animal ethics?

This discussion-based course explores the relationships between humans and non-human animals. Drawing on fiction, philosophy, and ethology, we will examine our beliefs and assumptions regarding animals, human-animal relations, and the ethical implications of the human-animal binary. This course will focus on a wide range of theoretical approaches, including the traditions of animal liberation and animal rights as articulated by thinkers such as Tom Regan and Peter Singer, the growing field of animal studies as represented by thinkers like Jacques Derrida, and current debates in practical ethics, such as animal experimentation, hunting, and invasive species.

Upon completion of the course, students will have refined their understanding of the concept of the animal and they will be familiar with the key legal and ethical debates regarding human-animal relationships. Course requirements include class discussions, weekly writing exercises, a midterm exam, and a final paper or project. Students should come to this class prepared to read challenging philosophical essays and to share their ideas with others.

This course highlights the allure, the dangers, uncertainties, risks, and joys of travel expressed in student writing. What words, images, foods, music, rituals, or other sources of inspiration spark curiosity and passions that make us want to go places?

Genre analysis, writing, and transdisciplinary research projects will deepen a sense of place as the course explores the rhetoric of travel and its transformative impacts.  Students will experiment with, for instance, flash-essays, chronicles, interviews, journals, and field notes. Research projects will spotlight judicious selection of relevant sources, integration of data, and inclusion of multimodal elements. We will consider, too, the relation between travel writing and ethnography, between travel and gender, racial, religious, and ethnic components. Conveying impressions after short or extended excursions, students will recognize and develop which rhetorical strategies are appropriate for particular purposes, situations, audiences, discourse communities, and genres. Maps, films, infographics, letters, newspaper articles, guidebooks, blogs, Instagram posts, diaries, and logs constitute genres that may be examined and created. Students will further hone their craft in writing workshops, conversations, conferences, and presentations.  

Short excerpts that reflect the intimate connection between travel and writing will be discussed, and the various rhetorical strategies employed by writers such as Matsuo Basho, Tu Fu, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Olaudah Equiano, Mary Kingsley, James Baldwin, Maxine Hong Kingston, Taras Grescoe, Bill Bryson, Annie Dillard, William Least Heat-Moon, Anthony Bourdain, Eileen Myles, Binyavanga Wainaina, and Hans M. Carlson. Whether an Inuit film for global audiences, or the map of a route across the North American continent by water, or notes in a diary from the Hindu Kush, for example, the course materials do more than simply record or narrate experiences and territories: they also report and shape the world and what it means to us. 
Evaluations will be based on class discussions, writing projects, and presentations.

Nobody exemplifies these notions better than Rushdie himself. Therefore, this course will be an exploration of the fantastical world of Salman Rushdie through his seminal novel Midnight’s Children. Deemed as one of the Great Books of the 20th century, which won the Booker prize the year of its publication, 1981, and the Booker of Bookers twice over (in 1993 and 2008), the novel is a prime example of postcolonialism with a magical realist twist.
In this class, we will take a deep dive into Rushdie’s novel by paying close attention to the prose and his style and the history and contexts that he sets up in this novel. Therefore, the reading of the novel will be supplemented with historical background and literary criticism that bring up questions of utopia, nation, politics, identity, and subalternity, to name a few. You will be evaluated on class participation and written assignments like discussion posts, an oral presentation, a paper, and a final project.

ES1075,W26,"Hall, Sarah",Geology of National Parks,,I,"In this introductory geoscience course students will learn foundational principles and concepts such as plate tectonics, geologic time, climate and weather, rocks and minerals, and surface processes through an exploration of some of the National Parks of the United States. Through virtual field trips of various parks, students will visualize how regional climate and surface processes such as rivers, glaciers, and wind interact with the bedrock and surficial materials to produce some of the most iconic landscapes. While Acadia National Park offers a view of an ancient and eroded supervolcano, Yellowstone offers a glimpse of a dynamic landscape built on a modern supervolcano. While a few glaciers still cling to the high peaks of Glacier National Park, Yosemite hosts steep glacially carved valleys and polished domes reminiscent of a glaciated past. Class time will be used for lectures, discussions of readings, and laboratory exercises. During labs, students will get to know approximately 6 different parks in detail through interaction with geologic maps, rock samples, aerial imagery, and scientific reports. The students will be evaluated based on laboratory exercises and a final project through which students will explore one park of their choosing.

HS1054,W26,"Stabinsky, Doreen",Climate Justice,,I,"Climate change is one of the biggest and most difficult challenges faced by contemporary societies. The challenge has multiple facets: environmental, social, political, economic – each with its own complexities. This course focuses primarily on the social, political and economic components of the climate problem, framed by the concept of climate justice. In the course students are introduced to basic conceptions of justice, the latest findings of climate science and possible impacts on regional scales, and the global politics of climate change, principally in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Climate justice and its operationalization is the principal organizing theme for work over the term, addressing questions such as: how the costs of climate change impacts and efforts to address climate change could or should be distributed between rich and poor, global north and global south; and what are the possible means whereby those costs might be addressed through collective action at various levels: local, national, and global. Students will be evaluated based on regular quizzes, several short papers, class participation, and a final synthetic paper or project.

HS1123,W26,"Nguyen, Hien",Introduction to Macroeconomics,,I,"This course provides an introductory lens to understand the economy as a whole – the macroeconomy – and how its various parts interact. We will study topics such as (i) the short-term fluctuation of the general price level, employment level, and total output level, (ii) the linkages between structural unemployment, economic inequality, and government policies, and (iii) the long-term trajectory of economic growth and the unevenness of capitalist development. Some of the key questions we will explore include: How do we measure the macroeconomy, and what do our conventional measurements often leave out? Why do cyclical economic booms and busts exist and what drives them? What can governments do to limit the costs of job loss on workers? Looking globally, why are some countries rich and other countries poor? How have global living standards improved over the long run, and at what cost to humans, non-human beings, and the environment?

This course aims to increase your ability to use abstract, quantitative models to describe and articulate the various ways in which macroeconomic factors frame the condition of possibilities for people, their families, and their communities. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and politically about public policies and debates. You will also expand your capacity for numerical literacy and quantitative skills such as drawing valid conclusions based on data and communicating your reasoning and results effectively and clearly. The course is especially valuable for students with interests in civic engagement, social justices, political transformation, and sustainable development. Previous knowledge in economics, calculus, statistics, and linear algebra is not necessary. Familiarity with elementary algebra will be helpful but not required. Students’ learning will be assessed through problem sets, and take-home exams.

HS2020,W26,"Longsworth, Gordon",GIS I: Foundations & Applications,,I/M,"Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on the Earth's finite resources could lead to disaster, not only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human populations. As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions.  This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.

This class will examine the origins of the idea of race and the ways it is central to the creation of the modern world. Drawing on histories of Europe and the Americas this class will look at the different ways racialized thinking was deployed in colonial contexts. Central themes of the course will be the history of race as an idea, the nature and impact of the Atlantic slave trade, how indigenous peoples reshaped European ideas of what it meant to be human, the construction of whiteness, and the history of slavery in the new world. The period covered by the class spans from the origins of race as an idea to the late nineteenth century. The course will be a hybrid of a lecture course and a readings seminar. Students will read major works in the field and develop an understanding of the historical background of contemporary forms of structural inequality justified and reinforced by racialized thinking. Students will do a series of short assignments, lead discussion of books, and undertake a major research paper. The research projects will allow students to explore topics beyond the chronological and spatial scope of the course.

Students will work primarily from direct observation to translate what they are seeing onto paper using dry and wet media. In their drawings, students will learn how to articulate a broad range of values in charcoal and investigate how tone and line can communicate a sense of space and form. Students will learn sighting and measurement techniques to translate relative proportions across their compositions. A broad range of ideas about composition and organization of forms will be introduced by engaging with the work of artists from different parts of the world throughout history. Students will work with a variety of materials and techniques: from charcoal to ink to using collage to deconstruct and then rebuild spaces.

Evaluation will be based on the completion of exercises and assignments in a way that demonstrates an understanding of the concepts and ideas introduced in the class, engagement with course materials, participation in discussions and critiques, and the ability to respond to feedback in one’s work.

Edward Albee told Andrea that a play is as long as it is. To that end, like a short story, the short form allows for the creation of numerous stories, testing of form and structure, experimentation, failure, and success. Scripts can range from 1 page to 10 pages or longer if need be. This writing workshop will be fast-paced and inquiry-driven. We will use class time to do writing exercises, ask and answer questions, discuss the craft of scriptwriting, and share and critique our own and one another’s work. Students will be expected to create ten scripts, re-draft 5 of those scripts, and select their favorite script to further refine and finalize as their final project.

Evaluation is based on the quality of written work and participation in class discussions. Work will be evaluated for quality, engagement, effectiveness, on-time delivery, and commitment to the workshop collective. Students are expected to bring in new plays each week and to contribute their best work to an end-of-class public reading.

AD5032,W26,"Clinger, Catherine",Advanced Studio Printmaking,,A,"This art studio course is a continuation of the introductory course Studio Printmaking. A print mirrors the surface of its matrix and presents a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This advanced studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking by experimenting with conventional and non-traditional ways of creating a range of matrices. Students will acquire skills as printmakers with an emphasis on multiple-plate, collagraph, and other advanced techniques. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper – engaging with more complex discourses of representation. Students will be evaluated on their projects, participation in critiques, level of engagement with materials, ability to work in a collaborative studio, and final project.

From kata=down, strephein=turn, the Greek katastrephein meant ""under-turning"" in the ancient world. This course explores postulations regarding large- and small-scale calamitous events that seem to originate from below the surface of Earth. Our enquiry engages with legendary tales, historical records, material culture and scientific discourses that document attempts to explain the meaning and/or mechanism of such memorable episodes. What causes a mountain to eject ash and toxic gases? What infernal force creates lava flow? Why does the earth shake? Why do some natural waters cause harm? How do we understand that which we cannot see? Through case-studies informed by the literature of science, the arts and humanities, we will plumb the depths and limits of the human imagination. This class uses both a lecture-based and seminar-style discussion approach as well as time spent visiting local lab and field sites. Students will be evaluated based on their weekly activities and writing assignments, and a final project with both oral and written presentation components.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.

Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended. Evaluation will be based on how the specific criteria set for each assignment are met, participation and engagement during critiques, and receptivity to feedback.

However, the science of restoration is still in its early phases, and important theoretical and practical questions remain to be resolved. This class will critically examine the assumptions that underlie restoration planning, both in the ethical dimension and in the realm of scientific theory. We will consider the validity of conceptual models of ecological communities and ecosystems and the way that these models shape decision-making. We will survey the factors that must be taken into account during restoration and study best-practices approaches, with a focus on adaptive management. In the final project, groups of students will develop and present restoration plans for a local site. Students will be evaluated based on two essays, class participation, and the final project.

ES1076,S26,"Todd, Sean",Polar Ecology and Exploration,,I,"The Arctic and Antarctic represent some of the most extreme environments on the planet. As physical places, both poles play an important role in governing the planet’s climate and heat flow. Both are suspected to be rich in minerals and are thought to perhaps hold short-term relief from current world shortages in natural resources. As ecosystems, both are hugely productive in spite of, and in part because of the extreme temperatures they experience; certain species are found nowhere else and in fact thrive in these remote locales. Superimposed upon these natural environments is the presence of humans. Exploration of both areas has been particularly focused in the past century, with countless stories of the perseverance and persistence of our pioneering spirit. Initially surveyed to forward nationalistic agendas, both poles are now sites of scientific inquiry. In particular, the political model that currently governs Antarctica as one massive Protected Area has no precedent and perhaps suggests a way forward for environmental agendas working on global scales. More recently, the poles have been exploited by ecotourism businesses.

This class examines the provinces of the Arctic and Antarctic, wildernesses whose boundaries can be defined physically, biologically, geologically and politically. We will examine the rich and highly adapted diversity of life as it is affected by local and global oceanography and atmospheric science, and assess the impacts of climate change on these fragile environments. We will also review our relationship with these places and examine what future we might play in preserving, and/or exploiting the polar regime, using Human Ecology as a model for our understanding. Evaluation will be by two term papers and participation in class activities.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.

We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. 

Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.

Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.

Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others. Students will also select a longer text to read from a list of authors that may include Jonathan Safran Foer, Susan Cain, Felicia Rose Chavez, Claudia Rankine, and others.

Students will walk the path from St. Jean Pied-du-Port to Santiago de Compostela that millions have traveled since the end of the 9th century. Designated as the first Cultural Route of the Council of Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the route starts in France, crossing the Pyrenees and traveling through the vineyards, plains of wheat and sunflower, verdant hills, medieval villages, and storied cities of northern Spain. While founded as a Catholic pilgrimage, people walking the route today may be embarking on a personal challenge, wrestling with existential questions and life transitions, searching for an intentional community with more caring societal norms or journeying for a myriad of other reasons. Intertwined with the Camino’s religious, cultural, and personal significance is its role as an economic engine across the millennia. The Roman roads and forts are testament to its long standing economic significance. From the age of the Knights Templar through today, the Camino continues to be the economic lifeblood of the region and the small businesses, inns and villages along the route. The course has three primary components. First, students will investigate the human ecology of the Camino through modern and ancient readings, film screenings, visits to sites of historical and cultural significance, and interactions with pilgrims. These materials and interactions will inform group discussions, as well as papers, presentations and other deliverables. Second, to move students beyond their quotidian routine, participants will follow a guided plan of self-discovery, introspection, and reflection that will take place on and around their daily walks. These activities include a series of exercises, one-on-one meetings, and journaling. Finally, to dive deeper into their own Camino, students will conduct a capstone research project of their own design. Proposals, finalized early in the course, shall include the most appropriate means of communicating their findings, such as a research paper, in-depth presentation, or other modality. Whether students are interested in history, geography, commerce, sustainable tourism, art, human relations, spirituality, local foodways, or what it means to be human, this journey will provide ample fodder for a curious mind. Evaluation will be based on engagement with the course, participation in group discussions and meetings, quality of the various written and verbal assignments, and the capstone research project. There are no prerequisites or language requirements. However, some knowledge of Spanish is encouraged and can provide for a more enriching experience. Students must be capable of walking with a 20+ pound backpack over a variety of terrain for an average of 12.4 miles (20 km) per day. As this is a monster expeditionary course, space is limited and enrollment requires permission of the instructor.

Assessment will be based on evidence that the student has completed assignments and readings; conducted a substantive and thorough independent research project; as well as, active and meaningful participation in seminar discussions and other course activities.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions.  This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on critique of student independent final project work and related documentation.

While there will be a heavy focus on traditional state-level diplomatic history, students will also explore a broad array of methodological approaches. Class sessions will include a mix of traditional lecture formats, class discussion, and outside presentations. An evening lab is scheduled in order to screen a variety of cultural artifacts from the various periods we will cover. The primary goal is to give students an intensive 10-week crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.. that defined the early decades of Cold War diplomacy. At the same time there is also time allocated for students to explore their own independent research interests. Given the far-reaching force of Cold War politics into everyday life, individuals with widely varying academic interests will find the course informative and productive.

HS3130,S26,"Nguyen, Hien",Conversation with the Ghost of Marx,,M,"This course introduces students to the study of political economy from a Marxian perspective. Unlike economics which focuses on various parts of the economy, whether at the micro- or macro- level, political economy focuses on the intertwining of power and money, or how politics affects the economic system and how the economy in turn shapes politics. As most of the world now lives with variants of the capitalist economic system, we will devote our time to understand the structure of capitalism, its functioning logics, as well as its contradictions and malfunctions. We will do so by engaging with Karl Marx’s original writings, which to this day still constitute one of the most fundamental and insightful critiques of the capitalist economic system. Marx’s Capital, Volume One will be both our guiding posts and a useful entry point for thinking about a wide range of issues, including labor and value, commodification and consumption fetishization, capital accumulation and growth, the role of the state in political economic processes, and the ongoing violence of accumulation.

As Eric Wolf, the late anthropologist, has noted, “the social sciences constitute one long dialogue with the ghost of Marx” (Europe and the People without History, 1982). Rather than being Marx’s disciples, we strive to be his interlocutor. As such, in addition to selections from Marx’s key works, we also read current Marxian political economy scholarship that draws on, critiques, and pushes its boundaries. Upon completion of this course, you will have developed practices of thinking critically and imaginatively about capitalism’s fundamental drives, uneven development, insatiable appetite for technological innovation, and tendency towards violent expansion. You will also be attuned to the need to contextualize contemporary debates regarding capitalism in its transnational, raced, and gendered dimensions.

The course is valuable for any students who want to better articulate the conditions of living under capitalism, or to cultivate a political imagination about the future of capitalist economic systems. Previous knowledge in economics is not necessary, but students must have an appetite for reading and parsing out complex, abstract texts. Prior exposure to Marxist theories or critical theories can be helpful. Students will be evaluated through bi-weekly reading reviews (approximately 3-5 pages of critical reflection based on assigned readings) and a final research proposal to investigate a socioeconomic issue of your choice.

This course is a human ecological exploration of sheep and wool, combined with a hands-on component in which we will work with sheep and learn fiber arts. This class will meet for one studio session and two lecture/discussion sections per week, plus at least one Saturday field trip. In the studio sessions, we will study sheep husbandry through visits to Peggy Rockefeller Farm, and learn a variety of techniques for working with wool, from the preparation (shearing, washing, and carding) to spinning and working with yarn (including knitting, crochet, and weaving). The lecture/discussion sessions will cover topics such as the ecological impacts of sheep in different parts of the world, the physics of spinning and the chemistry of dyes, and the symbolism of sheep in the mythology of different cultures. The course will draw on a wide range of material and intellectual approaches, with sheep and wool as the unifying theme. Students will be evaluated based on participation, short written assignments, and a final oral presentation. 

No prior knowledge of fiber craft is necessary, but students who come in knowing one of the basic techniques may be able to explore advanced techniques like lacework or design in three dimensions. Students should meet with the instructor before spring break to discuss goals and equipment needs for the studio sessions.

This course introduces students to the foundations of Buddhist philosophy and practice. Buddhism encompasses a variety of different traditions, teachings, practices, and goals. In this class, we will adopt a philosophical perspective to explore a range of Buddhist thinking on topics such as reality, consciousness, nothingness, and ethical conduct. 

We will begin by reading Asvagho?a's Buddhacarita, which tells the story of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha. Next, we will study the Theravada, Buddhism's foundational structure, and then proceed to explore the later Mahayana teachings. This course will study primary literature, including excerpts from the Pali Canon and several Mahayana sutras, alongside selections from contemporary thinkers such as Thích Nhat Hanh, angel Kyodo williams, and Pema Chödrön. Along the way, we will discuss suffering (dukkha), emptiness (suññata), impermanence (anicca), non-self (anatta), interdependence or dependent uprising (pa?iccasamuppada), desire (tanha), the four noble truths, the eightfold path, liberation and enlightenment (nibbana), action and causation (kamma), wisdom (pañña), compassion (karuna and bodhicitta), and our responsibilities to other beings. 

Although this course primarily focuses on Buddhist theory and Buddhist texts, students will be briefly introduced to different meditation and mindfulness practices through a series of guest speakers and a weekend visit to the Morgan Bay Zendo in Surry, Maine. This course will be conducted in seminar style with an emphasis on class participation. No prior background in Buddhism or philosophy is required.

This multidisciplinary course will encourage students to develop a regular sketchbook practice using animals as the focus of study. It is intended for any student who wishes to improve their sketching and observational skills, gain an understanding of animal anatomy, and learn about local animal life. Students will draw from museum specimens, taxidermy mounts, and live animals using a variety of media and techniques suitable for field sketching. Class will take place in the Dorr Museum and at field sites within Acadia National Park and Hancock County.

This course will meet for two three hour sessions per week. The first session will include a lesson about a particular animal taxon, followed by sketching exercises using museum specimens and mounts as references. In the second session, students will draw from live animals in the field. Students will also spend approximately nine hours per week outside of class on additional field sketching assignments, readings, and research.

Evaluations will emphasize participation and student growth rather than artistic ability. Our focus will be on practice and learning to effectively record observations, not on creating polished illustrations. Prior experience with drawing is not required.

ES1030,S26,"Hilliard, Rich",Chemistry II,,I,"This is the second half of a two-term sequence designed to help students describe and understand properties of materials.  This course begins with a survey of how the internal structure of atoms leads to the formation of different sorts of bonds between them. It then considers how weaker forces can arise between molecules and the sorts of physical phenomena that such forces explain. The class concludes by considering how to describe and explain the rates at which (and the extents to which) chemicals reactions occur and applies such descriptions and explanations to common types of reactions (acid/base and redox).  Throughout the course, examples are drawn from living systems, the natural environment, and industrial products.  The course meets for three hours of lecture/discussion and for three hours of lab each week.  Chemistry 1 is a strongly recommended a prerequisite for this course. Evaluations are based on class participation, homework, midterm and final exams and a term project or paper.

HS1094,S26,"Rand, Kendra",Public Speaking Workshop,,I,"Consider all the ways that public speaking could be a part of your academic and professional paths: presenting your research, sitting on a webinar panel, speaking up at ACM, advocating for an urgent cause or policy, preparing your senior project presentation, delivering a formal address at a special occasion, or even deciding to perform spoken word at an open-mic. This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.  Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly.  This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations  while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for  public communication.  Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits.  The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other.  This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches.  Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation.  All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course.  This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches.

We will discuss the major forcings driving global climate fluctuations - on both long (millions of years) and short (days) timescales, including natural and anthropogenic processes. We will also learn about basic meteorology and the processes producing some common spectacular optical weather phenomena (rainbows, coronas, cloud-types, etc). Students will complete a term project comprising a photo-documentary journal of the different weather phenomena they observe during the 10-week term. The field component of this course will be self-guided through the observation and documentation of weather phenomena.  Who should take this course: No prior geology/science experience is needed - but expect to do a bit of basic math in this course! The course level is intermediate because it will not cover foundational principles of geology (or other sciences) but instead the course will be integrative and require students to practice both their quantitative and qualitative skills. Take this course if you are passionate or curious about climate change, but do not know much about the science of climate and weather!

But from the dawn of cinema there have been those working on the edges to realize visions that speak to many modes of otherness and to different manners of being, of belonging. In this class we will investigate a range of diverse moving image works and engage with texts that help contextualize and elucidate the works and the creative impulses/individuals behind them. The roster of movies viewed this term will be chosen collaboratively from a curated list by the group at the beginning of the term so as to most effectively engage with the particular interests of this configuration of students; choices include (but are not limited to) films and videos made by and about members of the following communities: LGBTQ+, neurodiversity, seniors, economically disadvantaged, homeless, people with disabilities, people of faith, Inuit, Roma, Sami, Maya, Palawan, Amhara, African diaspora, Indigenous peoples of the US and Australia. Focus will be primarily on narrative forms, but some works with experimental aspects may be featured. Potential filmmakers include: Samira Makhmalbaf, David Gulpilil, Cheryl Dunye, Tony Gatlif, Euzhan Palcy, Haile Gerima, Mati Diop, Derek Jarman. Students will be evaluated on their participation in class discussions and on two papers written over the course of the term.

A print mirrors the surface whence it came and also performs as a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas.  Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression.  This studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking.  Students will acquire basic skills as printmakers with an emphasis on relief (woodcut and linocut) and intaglio (line etching, engraving and aquatint) techniques.  They will also develop a broad understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper.

How do contemporary composers and sound artists engage place-specific material in their work? This practice-based course examines the interdisciplinary field of sound studies through close reading, listening, and hands-on (ears-on?) work in sound. Students will create place-based recording projects and site-specific sound installations that draw on local fieldwork excursions around Frenchman Bay, as well as on archival research connected to the Maine Sound and Story Archive and others. Students will sharpen skills in field recording, audio editing, multi-channel sound mixing and presentation, artistic collaboration, and building sonic-rich soundscapes as they work to create immersive sound art projects. This class will work to expand the narrative podcast format, seeking more abstract and layered forms that draw on research and storytelling to help audiences sense a place or a concept through the experience of sound. The course will examine key readings in the field of sound studies, and investigate the practice of sound artists working at the intersections of sound and climate change, sound and social (in)justice, the repatriation of sound recordings, sound and ethnographic practice, and more. Students must have prior experience recording and editing sound, and a willingness to collaborate with their peers to synthesize and realize their ideas.

ES1026,S26,"Feldman, David",Intro to Chaos & Fractals,,I,"This course presents an elementary introduction to chaos and fractals.  The main focus will be on using discrete dynamical systems to illustrate many of the key phenomena of chaotic dynamics: stable and unstable fixed and periodic points, deterministic chaos, bifurcations, and universality.  A central result of this study will be the realization that very simple non-linear equations can exhibit extremely complex behavior.  In particular, a simple deterministic system (i.e., physical system governed by simple, exact mathematical rules) can behave in a way that is unpredictable and random, (i.e., chaotic).  This result suggests that there are potentially far-reaching limits on the ability of science to predict certain phenomena.  Students in this class will also learn about fractals---self-similar geometric objects---including the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.  We will also read about and discuss the development of the field of chaos.  In so doing, we will examine the nature of scientific communities, with a particular eye toward how changes in scientific outlooks occur.  Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to explore the relations between chaos, fractals, and other areas of study such as literature, art, and cultural studies.  Students who successfully complete this class should gain a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the basic ideas of chaos and fractals, a greater understanding of the cultural practice of science, and improved mathematical skills.  Evaluation will be based on class and lab participation, weekly problem sets several short writing assignments and a final project.

ES4016,S26,"Anderson, John",Island Life,,M/A,"Islands have played a major role in the development of ecological and evolutionary theory. Most recently, islands have served as an important metaphor in the development of conservation biology. Maine is blessed with a plethora of islands -between 4500 and 6000 at the last count- and the history and pre-history of these islands is intimately entwined with that of the continent itself. This course examines historical and current interpretations of island biogeography and the interplay between natural and human history and human ecology. The class will be taught as a combination of term-time seminar and in the field, based on the College's field station on Great Duck Island and the College's research vessel. During the Spring term we will be meeting regularly to examine the theoretical basis of Island Biogeography and islands as the subject of scientific and literary discussion since Aristotle. Readings will include Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace, and contemporary authors.  In late August we will re-convene for the field component of the class. During the first half of this component, we will be focusing primarily on Great Duck Island and its immediate surroundings, learning and applying theoretical approaches to islands' landscapes, with extensive reading from the primary literature. During the second half of the class, we will move further afield, exploring a variety of islands in eastern Maine, and relating our observations to theoretical predictions. Ultimately we hope to travel to Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy to observe a large island community, see the traditional weir fishery, and observe firsthand migrating right and humpback whales, and northern seabirds.

Using historic makers for inspiration some slide lectures will be included, but each student will be expected to do some research on their own to find inspiration from other artists. Being inclusive of various aesthetics, we’ll explore differing expressions of beauty and students will be expected to engage ways of working outside their own comfort zone. Readings by Rebecca Solnit, Lucy Lippard, Frank Gohlke, Deborah Bright, Robert Adams, Richard Misrach, John Stilgoe, Bill McKibben, and Geoffrey Batchen, among others, will inform our discussions. Weekly shooting assignments, and readings will be expected prior to mid term. After mid term, you will work toward one final project that explores your own personal expressive choices based on your interests and affinities.

AD1072,S26,"Soares, Zach",Audio Production as Compositional Tools,,I,"In 1979, the music producer Brian Eno argued that the recording studio is a “compositional tool,” upending the idea that the recording studio exists to document pre-existing musical compositions. His assertion came on the back of pivotal albums such as The Beatles’ “Revolver” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966), which demonstrated the creative possibilities of composing in the studio. We might call this type of approach to music composition “playing the studio.” In this course, students learn how music production makes use of editing, mixing, and effect processing to maximize its impact. Through readings, film screenings, and audio listening sessions, students learn about past and present studio techniques and use these techniques during audio projects and exercises. Students learn to use virtual instruments, effect processors, microphones, and COA’s recording studio to strengthen their technical audio recording, editing, and mixing skills. Students will be evaluated based on their participation in class discussions, their fluency in the use of recording equipment and software, the process they use to approach each assignment, and the completion of assigned projects.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.

Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended.

The premise of the course is that by exploring this fascinating crop in detail from the local vantage point of Downeast Maine students will be able to grasp the many historical processes at work from the introduction of the fruit in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries to the age of agricultural improvement in the eighteenth on to the rise and fall of commercial orcharding as a major component of Maine’s farm economy in the early twentieth century.  Using sources ranging from secondary sources, historical atlases, aerial surveys, and diaries, we will explore how the culture of apple agriculture in Maine develops over time as part of an interconnected Atlantic World where crops flow back and forth between Britain and the colonies/U.S. over hundreds of years.  Course activities will include fruit exploration and fieldtrips to track down and identify antique varieties, as well as visits to the local farms where a new generation of apple culture is taking shape.  The course will also engage students with the process of cider-making, both sweet and hard, as well as exercises in the preparation, storage, and processing of apples.  Students will be evaluated on their participation in discussion, how they collaborate with others in class projects, and a final individual or collaborative project.  This course is designed for students interested in history, farming and food systems, community-based research, and policy/planning issues.

The first part of the course critically examines capitalist food systems with particular attention to the ways culture, politics, and economics shape our interactions with food. Through readings and exercises, we explore issues such as nutrition, worker safety, contested agricultural and land use policies, hunger, and environmental and community health. The second part of the course examines case studies of transformative food movements around the world, from the Zero Hunger programs in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to La Via Campesina global campaign for agrarian reform. We focus particularly on food sovereignty and agroecology movements. The final third of the course focuses on transformative work in Maine and at COA. Students take multiple field trips to participate in local movements and to learn about their philosophies, objectives, and activities. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze how power shapes food systems and articulate a theory of change for addressing a food systems problem of their choice.

HS4098,F26,"Cox, Gray",The Human Ecology of Artificial Intelligence: Problems and Projects,,M/A,"This course examines the challenges, threats and opportunities emerging with technologies associated with Artificial Intelligence. It will consider the nature of intelligence in its many forms in humans and nature and examine how these and other forms of intelligence may be coded into emerging AI technologies or developed through various forms of machine learning, evolutionary programming, et cetera. Sample topics include roles of AI in education, health, agriculture, transportation, policing, military, scientific research, the arts, spiritual traditions, religions, government, language translation, and bridging relations between different cultures.

Goals are to develop: understandings of the basic programming principles, research and development strategies and underlying philosophical assumptions guiding development in such technologies; abilities to use interdisciplinary, problem centered approaches to understand complicated vs. “wicked” problems associated with rapid technological change and key approaches to dealing with them; collaborative skills for problem-centered studies and programming projects in AI in areas of student interest; and meta-cognitive abilities to learn these kinds of material in groups as well as on your own.

Students pursue term projects individually or collaboratively which may include; futures studies use of methods of historical and/or social science research to investigate some emerging, AI-related social or environmental concern; a computer programming project that solves a practical problem, is conducive to artistic expression, performs scientific analysis of quantitative data, or demonstrates an established or experimental feature of an Machine Learning or otherwise AI system; or a philosophical and/or theoretical critical analysis of underlying concepts, values or assumptions that are at stake in the emerging AI technologies.

Readings will include classic texts in AI theory, philosophy, and futures studies as well as selections from standard texts on AI programming like that of Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. We will also use podcasts, films, and other media to pursue key topics and trends. There will be a series of short programming activities to study basic principles and try modelling aspects of more complicated and/or complex systems. These will be done, at least initially, in block coding accessible to students without previous programming experience. We will examine the ways in which they can be coded in Python and students familiar with that or other languages will be able to pursue homework and final project work in whatever language they may prefer.

Class sessions and lab will vary in format from extended discussion of texts and problems to supplementary lecture, visiting speakers, collaborative coding activities and extended project work. The class as a group will develop at least one major hackathon style project as a way of exploring key issues and developing key skills.

Evaluation will be based on the extent to which students demonstrate in homework, class participation and term projects that they have advanced in each of the four main goals for the course.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.

We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. 

Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.

Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.

Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others. Students will also select a longer text to read from a list of authors that may include Jonathan Safran Foer, Susan Cain, Felicia Rose Chavez, Claudia Rankine, and others.

Students will walk the path from St. Jean Pied-du-Port to Santiago de Compostela that millions have traveled since the end of the 9th century. Designated as the first Cultural Route of the Council of Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the route starts in France, crossing the Pyrenees and traveling through the vineyards, plains of wheat and sunflower, verdant hills, medieval villages, and storied cities of northern Spain. While founded as a Catholic pilgrimage, people walking the route today may be embarking on a personal challenge, wrestling with existential questions and life transitions, searching for an intentional community with more caring societal norms or journeying for a myriad of other reasons. Intertwined with the Camino’s religious, cultural, and personal significance is its role as an economic engine across the millennia. The Roman roads and forts are testament to its long standing economic significance. From the age of the Knights Templar through today, the Camino continues to be the economic lifeblood of the region and the small businesses, inns and villages along the route. The course has three primary components. First, students will investigate the human ecology of the Camino through modern and ancient readings, film screenings, visits to sites of historical and cultural significance, and interactions with pilgrims. These materials and interactions will inform group discussions, as well as papers, presentations and other deliverables. Second, to move students beyond their quotidian routine, participants will follow a guided plan of self-discovery, introspection, and reflection that will take place on and around their daily walks. These activities include a series of exercises, one-on-one meetings, and journaling. Finally, to dive deeper into their own Camino, students will conduct a capstone research project of their own design. Proposals, finalized early in the course, shall include the most appropriate means of communicating their findings, such as a research paper, in-depth presentation, or other modality. Whether students are interested in history, geography, commerce, sustainable tourism, art, human relations, spirituality, local foodways, or what it means to be human, this journey will provide ample fodder for a curious mind. Evaluation will be based on engagement with the course, participation in group discussions and meetings, quality of the various written and verbal assignments, and the capstone research project. There are no prerequisites or language requirements. However, some knowledge of Spanish is encouraged and can provide for a more enriching experience. Students must be capable of walking with a 20+ pound backpack over a variety of terrain for an average of 12.4 miles (20 km) per day. As this is a monster expeditionary course, space is limited and enrollment requires permission of the instructor.

HS1109,F26,"Khor, Su Yin",Genre Explorations,,I,"As someone who writes every day, you have probably noticed that it’s more common to text LOL to a friend, as opposed to writing “LOL things were busy” when emailing to ask a professor for an extension on a paper. Similarly, you probably expect this course description to include certain information about the course rather than tips for becoming a viral sensation on TikTok. Why do these differences exist? What is the point of knowing the differences? And how is this relevant to writing?

In this course, you will explore different kinds of writing (genres) to understand how the context shapes the way we write. The explorations of various everyday, academic, and professional genres will help refine the rhetorical skills that you already have and develop your awareness of how writing is used in different contexts. The goal is to build your knowledge of writing and make your repertoire of languages and literacies visible so you can transfer these skills and write in other courses and non-academic settings.

The class activities will provide you with many hands-on opportunities to explore and analyze writing in a collaborative setting with your peers in small and large group activities. You will complete inquiry-based projects to examine different genres and reflect on your evolving understanding of writing. Your learning will be evaluated based on these assignments and activities. By the end of the course, you will have developed the language to talk about writing and built the skills, agency, and confidence to engage in different kinds of writing activities in academia and beyond.

HS1115,F26,"Lakey, Heather",Utopia/Dystopia,,I,"The practice of social dreaming has a long history in philosophical thinking, stretching back to Tao Yuanming and Plato. What constitutes a perfect or ideal society? Or, if no such place is possible, what makes for a well-functioning society? Likewise, what constitutes a terrible society? What kind of places and spaces do we want to avoid? These are important questions for human ecologists to ask as we seek to improve our relationships with our natural, social, and technological environments. To explore questions of imaginary, ideal, and flawed places, this course studies the concepts of utopia and dystopia across a range of philosophical, political, and literary writings. Although we will focus our attention on theoretical literature, we will read one novel and several short stories.

Additional course questions include: What motivates us to envision utopias and dystopias? Does political philosophy require a utopian vision? What do utopias and dystopias tell us about social fears, anxieties, and hopes? Are utopia and dystopia inherently connected? What theoretical questions spring from the utopia/dystopia binary?  We will read texts such as, Plato’s Republic, Thomas More’s Utopia, Rokeya Hossain’s Sultana’s Dream, Marx and Engels’ Communist Manifesto, Elizabeth Grosz’s The Time of Architecture; William Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, José Estaban Muñoz’s Cruising Utopia, Sigmund Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents, Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower, Ursula K. LaGuin’s The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, Laozi's Tao Te Ching, Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, Alex Zamalin’s Black Utopia, and selections from The Utopian Reader by Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent.

We examine, as background, the nature and limitations of international law as a force for change. The course will then explore customary law, the relationship between soft and hard law, enforcement of international law, implementation mechanisms, and the effectiveness of multilateral environmental agreements. Special attention is given to existing international environmental law frameworks addressing climate change, Arctic and Antarctic development, ozone depletion, biological diversity, forest loss, export of toxic chemicals, and the host of issues raised by the 1992 United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and subsequent environmental fora.  Students will also consider the interface between international environmental law and other important international forces such as the Bretton Woods institutions, human rights frameworks, and international development entities.  Students will be evaluated on the quality of their classroom comments and several analytical problem sets given during the term.  Students will also be asked to complete a major research project examining the effectiveness of a treaty or a proposed international environmental legal arrangement.

Recent methodological and conceptual work as well as growing interest in the history of these topics driven by conservation and policy issues has made this an important and innovative field.  Using the work of a variety of scholars from different fields the class will explore how historical accounts can be constructed with an emphasis on the types of available sources, the use of evidence, and how each author builds their argument.  We will explicitly compare the methods, use of evidence and other aspects of different disciplinary approaches to the topic to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach.  This dimension of the class is particularly interesting because of the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of scholarship right now that brings a wide range of research into dialogue. Students will learn about the history of oceans and fishes by looking at how historians and other scholars frame their works and make their arguments.  Students will be evaluated on their preparation for discussion, mastery of the material, short written assignments, and a final project made up of a presentation and essay.  This course is appropriate for students with interest in history, community-based research, marine studies, and environmental policy.  Students who are just curious and interested in lots of things are also most welcome.

Taking a multifaceted view of human relationships with nature, students will generate research projects driven by questions about tourism and eco-tourism, species population change, climate degradation, the role of technology, and development of wildlands and waterways. Research discussed in class will also center on environmental values and challenges expressed by ecocritics, naturalists, biologists, philosophers, archaeologists, psychologists, poets, filmmakers, and others from the nineteenth century to the present. Several local excursions will provide opportunities for taking field notes. Students will be encouraged to experiment with different forms of writing, expanding their genre analysis, rhetorical awareness, and research practices, while deepening their own relationship with nature. Sharing work during peer reviews will become integral, uncovering and inspiring various writing processes.

This transdisciplinary, experiential approach will help establish a strong foundation for students’ writings outside this course and for evaluating possible impacts on the environment by potential encroachments. Spanning memoir, travel, science and nature, cultural issues, and current events, short readings will include writers such as Wendell Berry, Charles Darwin, Susan Fenimore Cooper, Luther Standing Bear, Jacquetta Hawkes, Richard Wright, Edward Abbey, N.

HS1102,F26,"McKown, Jamie","Equal Rights, Equal Voices: Articulating Suffrage",,I,"This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century woman suffrage activists in the United States. This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott,  Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who are generally less well known today. While this is a course rooted in the history of what we might consider early American feminism, it should come as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront issues that continue to have salience today.  Many of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity, equality, empowerment, and political allyship that these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant for us to consider in our contemporary context.  This is especially true when it comes to the topic of race and the intersectional nature of the discourse around gender equality, both then and now. We will spend time examining how the idea of race was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and inclusionary ways, within these texts.  We will also look specifically at the works of early Black feminists in the United States, and the myriad of ways they  navigated the challenges of the moment, especially as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of white supremacy within the early woman suffrage movement.   Rather than rely primarily on secondary historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials, mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers “in their own words.” In addition, students will also take part in “hands on” recovery projects designed to locate, transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible works  from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring and making effective use of various types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in recent years. Class sessions will be organized as a discussed based seminar.  Assignments will emphasize critical, reflective, and analytical writing. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short written response papers, two longer form take-home essays, individual presentations, and a final “recovery” project. Students interested in topics related to gender, politics, historical research, and activism are especially encouraged to enroll. This is an introductory class and open to all students regardless of whether they have a previous background in feminism, social theory, US history, or politics.

How are they made? Where do you locate yourself within the structures of which you are part? With whom are you in relation? How can we think about the idea of “agency” in conditions made by economic, political, material and social forces beyond our control? What is structural change? This course examines questions about change, resistance to change, choice, power, responsibility, politics and difference through an introduction to structural and post-structural thought. Structuralism and post-structuralism are modes of thinking that posit that the parts of a structure (e.g. of a society, of a text, of an institution) are made through their relations in that structure. This course will draw on structural and post-structural work in anthropology, literature, science and technology studies (STS), in postcolonial, gender and feminist studies, as well as in deconstruction and psychoanalysis, to investigate the significance of structures of kinship, economy, and language, as well as of institutions such as the school, the military, the state and the corporation. Students will be asked to consider the relation between individual and group, material, economic, racialized and gendered conditions of existence, and notions of agency, responsibility, the individual and the human. In addition to seminar discussions of texts and short writing assignments, students will select a structure within which they are located through which to investigate the central questions of the course. Authors we read will likely include Louis Althusser, Emily Apter, Tarek El-Ariss, Charisse Burden-Stelly, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Emile Durkheim, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Donna Haraway, Ranjana Khanna, Claude Levi-Strauss, Karl Marx, Edward Said, Ferdinand de Saussure, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Anna Tsing.

Class meetings will combine analysis of published work with a discussion of how individual writers approach their craft. We will study the conflict, character, plot and music of prose. The focus of this class will be literary fiction. I define literary fiction as work that is concerned not just with what happened, but why it happened. It is character driven and explores the motivations, desires, drives and consequences of the complex human experience. It is the stuff of life. Representative authors: Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Amelia Gray, Makoto Kawabata, Gish Jen, Hemingway, Flannery O’Connor, Milan Kundera, Mary Gaitskill, James Baldwin, Junot Diaz.

But what do we mean by “nature,” and what distinguishes a natural environment from a social one? Moreover, what kinds of relationships should we cultivate with our natural environments? This discussion-based course explores the concepts of nature and environmental responsibility across different philosophical and cultural frameworks. We will draw on a variety of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism, deep ecology, American transcendentalism, indigenous studies, queer theory, and Buddhism. We will read selections from thinkers such as John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, Arne Naess, Val Plumwood, Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau, Eduardo Kohn, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Thich Nhat Hanh, Anna Tsing, and others. 

Guiding questions include the following: What is nature? How is the idea of nature politicized and socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations to nature? How should humans relate to nature? What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction between humans and nature? Although this course will focus primarily on theoretical questions, we will also discuss issues in applied ethics such as, control over natural resources, wilderness preservation, sustainability, and consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit questions pertaining to environmental activism, and we will consider how philosophy can help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities and obligations. 

Upon completion of this course, students will have gained a richer philosophical understanding of the idea of nature and they will be familiar with key debates in environmental ethics. Course requirements include weekly writing assignments, a midterm exam, a final paper, and class participation. There are no prerequisites, but students should arrive to this class prepared to engage difficult philosophical texts and to share their ideas with others.

To what degree are we prepared to be challenged or confronted by something new or different? Of approximately 5000 films produced yearly worldwide, fewer than 5% are given a general U.S. theatrical release. Of these 250, fewer than 30 come from outside the Hollywood system. There are wonderful, unique movies being made every day that most of us will never know exist. This is largely due to entrenched ideas of how to play it commercially ""safe,"" but also has a great deal to do with a national isolationism which Hollywood films support and perpetuate. What are filmmakers in other countries focusing their attentions on? What stylistic choices are they making? How does one find out about these other films, let alone see them? In this class we will watch movies made within the last twelve years in Austria, Belgium, Burkina Faso, Canada, China, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and many other countries--films made by directors the rest of the world acknowledges as masters but who are virtually unknown in the U. S. Critical and theoretical essays from a variety of sources will offer detailed readings on the individual films as well as give a clear picture of how Hollywood functions to silence other voices and the ramifications of these practices on world finance and culture.

In response to environmental and social crisis, theory and praxis figure significantly in the work of artists and artist collectives from around the globe whose practice manifests as socially engaged art (SEA) defined by Pablo Helguera; data/information reimagined as by Mona Hatoum and Trevor Paglen; or examinations of reconciliation and mass trauma in the work of Doris Salcedo and Kara Walker. In some cases, artworks engage with nature/culture by their placement in site-specific locations, through new modes of picturing, and/or through the appropriation of hypothetical scientific musings or emerging technologies (e.g., Ed Atkins, fictionalized genetic hybridization and subversion of surveillance tools). Many of the artists we examine make use of new tools designed for industrial purpose, medical, agricultural, or scientific research. Others further participatory dialogues within anti-racist, de-colonizing, and queer-centred discursive practices. This work is inherently transdisciplinary and human ecological in disposition and character. Many of these producer-artists appropriate the role of “researcher” in order to bring attention to ecologies that human beings have disrupted or will disrupt. Doris Salcedo, Tacita Dean, Kara Walker, Mark Dion, Shirin Neshat, Ai Weiwei, Andra Ursuta, Karim Ben Khelifa, Raven Chacon, Frances Alys, Natalie Jeremijenko, Guillermo Galindo, among others, will be considered.

AD2042,F26,"Muller, Brook",Ecologies of Cities,,I/M,"We typically think of cities as centers of political and economic power, social vibrancy (and tension), and cultural richness, diversity and production. This course explores ecological “readings” of cities, landscapes transformed irrevocably due to human activities and the introduction of unprecedented concentrations of “unnatural” substances and significant loss of biological and hydrological integrity. The course also examines processes by which cities have transformed surrounding regional landscapes as both “wells” of resources and “sinks” for waste and the planetary scale environmental impacts of urban growth in the contemporary global economy. Following a succinct historical survey in the first part of the class (with focus on the interrelated forces of industrialization, colonization and explosive urban growth in the nineteenth century), we will look to recent efforts to reimagine cities such that they are more “ecological.” These efforts come in a variety of forms from “city as refugia” (establishing habitat for nonhumans) to “novel ecosystems” (working with new concentrations of contaminants and colonization of non-native biological communities) to cities as settings in which closed-loop, ecologically inspired systems drive processes of development. Of concern related to all of these ecological urbanisms is that conversion of city landscapes from grey to green and blue can lead to ever greater levels of inequality. In the final section of the course, we will speculate as to ways to intervene in cities-as-ecosystems that build on commitments to both social justice and ecological replenishment, bringing into relation the flourishing of humans and nonhumans in urbanized environments. Evaluations will be based on class participation and sustained engagement with the core themes: attendance, demonstration of close readings of texts, contributions to group discussions (including listening), honing of collaborative capabilities, and commitment to an iterative process with the three course projects (the last of which will be worked on in teams) that involve succinct compositions of written narratives and diagrams and other visual representations (multiple graphics workshops will be structured into the class).

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.

Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended.

A print mirrors the surface whence it came and also performs as a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas.  Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression.  This studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking.  Students will acquire basic skills as printmakers with an emphasis on relief (woodcut and linocut) and intaglio (line etching, engraving and aquatint) techniques.  They will also develop a broad understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper.

AD4046,F26,"Sebastian, Neeraj",Drawing Intensive / Developing a Studio Practice,,M/A,"In the first part of this course, drawing will be used to experiment, interrogate and expand different aspects of one’s artistic practice. Using a broad range of materials, students are encouraged to work intuitively and take multiple approaches to presenting ideas–especially ideas that may not have been explored previously in their work–and develop them in different ways. Students will create large quantities of drawings based on prompts that will then be discussed with the class. What stands out? What makes a piece surprising or interesting? What revisions can be made to strengthen these moments or motifs? These are kinds of questions that will inform our discussions.

Taken together, these drawings will offer a broad range of possibilities that will then be explored for the rest of the term, during which students will develop a body of work. Students will meet weekly as a group to discuss work made or advanced in the previous week and meet individually with the instructor every other week to discuss materials and other aspects of their art practices. The work made over the course of the term should include material investigation (why are you using the materials you’re using and how does it support your thematic interests?) and embody a range of conceptual concerns. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to several artists’ working methods. Students are expected to work independently and have some degree of familiarity with the materials they choose to work with.

“Drawing” is used broadly here: students working in any medium are encouraged to take this course (for example, a student interested in three-dimensional work might respond to the prompts with forms made from cardboard or other found materials). This course is designed to kickstart a nascent practice or one that might have become dormant or plateaued as well as give students room to experiment and then build on these experiments. Students enrolling in this class should have some form of previous studio experience.   Evaluation will be based on students’ work, participation in class discussions, the ability to offer critical and constructive feedback to one’s peers, and the ability to push oneself beyond one’s comfort zone or perceived limitations—especially when it comes to allowing the work to evolve and change in response to feedback and critique.

Additionally, this course will be useful for those interested in energy and climate policy, either internationally or domestically.  We will begin with a quick overview of current CO2 emissions levels and look at how this is related to energy use.  We will then turn our attention to basic ideas from physics, including the definition of energy and the difference between energy and power.  The bulk of the course will consist of a survey of different forms of energy consumption and generation.  Throughout, we will quantitatively analyze technology from both a local and global point of view.  For example, we will calculate how much electricity one can generate on a rooftop, and we will also examine the role that solar PV could play toward the goal of eliminating fossil fuel use worldwide.  In a unit on financial mathematics, students will learn about the time value of money and several ways of quantifying investments, including ROI (return on investment) and IRR (internal rate of return).  Students will apply these financial tools in several short case studies.  If time permits, we may also cover negative emissions technologies and the electrical grid, including grid stability issues and the potential of smart-grid technology. This will be a demanding, introductory, class. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets.

ES1090,F26,"Gadeken, Kara",Intertidal Ecology,,I,"The intertidal occupies the space on the ocean shore between the highest and lowest extents of the tides, and the organisms inhabiting the intertidal must adapt to an ever-fluctuating environment. It is unique among ecosystems in that it condenses and concentrates many ecological processes along a strong physiological gradient, and so serves as an ideal environment to observe and investigate fundamental ecological principles.

In this course, you will be introduced to the many diverse intertidal ecosystems of coastal Maine, from rocky shorelines to tidal mudflats to salt marshes. Through discussions in class and observations in the field, we will endeavor to answer the questions:

What organisms are found in the intertidal, and how are they adapted to life there?
How is the distribution of intertidal organisms dictated by living in a transitional environment?
How do intertidal organisms interact with each other, and how does this shape the community?

We meet twice per week for class time with one afternoon lab period. During lab time we will be going on field trips as much as possible to explore the local intertidal habitats. This course is intended as an accessible introduction to marine community ecology and field work. Assessment is based on weekly question sets, lab assignments, and a short research proposal.

This course is a partner course to Ecology: Natural History, meaning we explore the same topics just in different environments. Therefore, students may enroll in either Intertidal Ecology or Ecology: Natural History but not both.

MD4014,F26,"Gibson, David",Building Science and Energy Audting,,M/A,"Buildings account for nearly 40% of global carbon emissions. Sixty percent of Maine homes are heated with heating oil, the highest percentage of any state, and Mainers spend more than a billion dollars on heating oil each year. Improving the efficiency of our homes and buildings is essential for transitioning away from fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions.

In this course, students will learn how to safely transition buildings away from fossil fuels. This includes understanding the science of energy and moisture movement through a building, how to monitor carbon monoxide and other harmful combustion gases, and methods to reduce energy loss, while maintaining comfortable levels of humidity and fresh air. Students will gain proficiency measuring air leakage with a blower door, using an infrared camera to assess insulation levels, calculating heat loss, and identifying solutions and best practices to develop a plan of action for homeowners.

They will also learn about high efficiency mechanical systems like air source heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and how to assess lighting and appliance electrical usage. Students will learn how to carry out cost calculations for energy savings and research and share information on rebates and incentives available for homeowners. This will be a very hands-on course, with weekly labs to teach energy auditing field skills. This course will include presentations from local energy contractors, and students will participate in energy audits of residential buildings on or off campus. Through these experiences, students will meet and interact with home performance businesses and non-profit organizations in the local community. As time and weather conditions permit, students will gain experience implementing efficiency solutions such as insulation and air sealing.

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to conduct energy audits for homes, identify cost-effective improvements, and prioritize energy improvements to maximize energy savings. This course will provide students with the tools and experience to reduce building energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in a holistic, whole-building approach.

Evaluation will be based on completion of assignments, participation in class discussions, and mastery of field skills.

This course focuses on the classification of land plants, with a particular focus on herbaceous taxa found in coastal Maine. Through lectures and field, lab, and herbarium work, we will gain familiarity with the practice of systematics and the characteristics of plants that are used to infer their phylogenetic relationships. Lectures will cover the theory and practice of systematics, including botanical nomenclature, plant identification terminology, relationships among the major plant groups and characters with taxonomic significance, herbarium specimen preparation, and bioinformatics. Labs will cover collection methods, specimen preparation, and field characters for about 30 plant families in the region. Evaluation will be based on participation, field and lab quizzes, a 5-minute oral presentation on a plant species chosen by the instructor and a 15-minute oral presentation on a topic in plant systematics chosen by the student, and a collection of at least 30 plant specimens from at least 20 different families prepared and identified by the student. Students should plan to begin collecting specimens over the summer in preparation for the course, following guidance that will be provided to registered students during the spring term.

This class will examine the origins of the idea of race and the ways it is central to the creation of the modern world. Drawing on histories of Europe and the Americas this class will look at the different ways racialized thinking was deployed in colonial contexts. Central themes of the course will be the history of race as an idea, the nature and impact of the Atlantic slave trade, how indigenous peoples reshaped European ideas of what it meant to be human, the construction of whiteness, and the history of slavery in the new world. The period covered by the class spans from the origins of race as an idea to the late nineteenth century. The course will be a hybrid of a lecture course and a readings seminar. Students will read major works in the field and develop an understanding of the historical background of contemporary forms of structural inequality justified and reinforced by racialized thinking. Students will do a series of short assignments, lead discussion of books, and undertake a major research paper. The research projects will allow students to explore topics beyond the chronological and spatial scope of the course.

Contemporary bioethics is an expansive and fundamentally interdisciplinary field, but this course will consider key dilemmas in bioethics from a philosophical perspective. More specifically, we will explore how bioethical issues complicate our concepts of right and wrong, good and bad, life and death, and the human and the natural.  

We will begin with a quick overview of prominent ethical theories and we will consider the possibility of transcultural bioethics. Secondly, we will address the ethical and philosophical questions raised by the following topics: abortion, birth, population, reproduction, cloning, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, resource allocation and organ donation, human research ethics, genetic engineering, the doctor-patient relationship, and medical decision making. Throughout the duration of the term, we will consider how different ethical frameworks shape our assessment of contemporary moral dilemmas.

This course will introduce students to the principles of ethical thinking, familiarize students with pressing debates in bioethics, and compel students to discuss issues that are politically and socially contentious. Course requirements include engaged class participation, three short papers, a presentation, contributions to online discussion documents, and a final paper. There are no prerequisites for this course, but students should be prepared to engage complex, theoretical essays that require careful and critical reading.

HS1110,W27,"Khor, Su Yin",Food and identity writing: Multimodality in composition,,I,"It feels like pizza has always been considered American, but we know that it was originally brought to the US by Italian immigrants. Both the US and Italy claim pizza as a national dish, and this type of debate about where food comes from—and who it belongs to—is highly connected to our national and local identities. As humans continue to migrate across borders and blur the boundaries in digital spaces, our identities continue to develop as we interact with each other and different types of food. We will consider how this movement shapes our ideas of ‘foreign’ and ‘local’ and how one becomes the other, as well as the line between honoring a culture and appropriating it.

We will examine the intersections of the genre conventions, rhetorical situation, and the writers’ identities to understand how these elements work together when producing texts. We will learn key composition concepts (genre, rhetorical situation, and multimodality) and support the
development of your genre research skills. We will use these concepts and conduct genre research to examine various food writing genres, such as narratives, recipes, and social media posts to understand how writing is an activity that goes beyond putting words together on a piece
of paper. These activities will support your overall genre research skills and deepen your understanding of writing, which can be transferred to other writing activities beyond this course. Classes will be based on genre analysis activities and group discussions. We will read works that address food writing genres and identity, and we will watch documentaries that explore the intersections of food, identity, and migration. Course assignments include your reproduction of a food writing genre, weekly reading responses, reflections and narratives to document your learning trajectory, which will also be used for assessment purposes.

HS2091,W27,"Mahoney, Dan",Forms of Poetry,,I/M,"This class is a study of, and a writing workshop in, poetic forms.  We will look at constraints, techniques, and directions of contemporary poetry through intensive reading, writing, and criticism of our own poetic work.  This background is useful and significant for the study of poetry at any level, and is especially helpful in light of the fact that, for better or worse, free verse techniques have dominated poetry in the twentieth century.  This course is valuable for practiced poets, emerging poets, and prose writers alike. Forms of Poetry asks students to pay attention, create poetry of attention, and revel in poetry that is attentive to language; this process will help students develop voice and lyrical content in their own writing. We will look older, “received forms” (Sonnet, Ghazal, Villanelle) and create our own forms by using experimental techniques (homophonic translation, concrete poetry, erasure, nonsense words (i.e. Jabberwocky)) and look to end the term with the amazing Japanese form, Zuihitsu. You might be thinking: Why write with these crazy constraints or in these old timey poetic forms? And what the heck is a Zuihitsu? Those are good questions, questions we will address on a weekly basis.  Over the last seventy years, the debates over poetic expression have been shaped in visceral ways, from “raw” versus “cooked,” “academic” versus “beat,” “formal” versus “antiformal.”  This class is designed to deepen your knowledge of these debates and to inspire you to draw upon a variety of modes in your own writing.  Evaluations:  Students will be expected to contribute to a class blog, write several poems a week, revise poetic output, participate in class workshop, and hand sew a chapbook of their own revised, creative work.

This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.  Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly.  This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations  while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for  public communication.  Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits.  The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other.  This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches.  Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation.  All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course.  This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches.

Currently twenty-eight countries have joined together in a supra-national political and economic union, creating a political entity unique to a world of sovereign individual nation-states. This course focuses on understanding this complex and evolving union through study of its main political institutions: the European Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. We will look at the workings of and functional relationships between these institutions through readings, meetings with politicians, bureaucrats, and NGOs involved in European-level politics, and visits to each of the institutions during two weeks in Brussels. We will also spend some time in the course looking at the broader political and cultural context in which the institutions operate, through examination of several important current topics in European politics. Topics could include: refugees and migrants in Europe, the reauthorization of the Common Agricultural Policy, Brexit, the rise of right-wing movements across countries in the EU. Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions, a reflective journal kept during their time in Brussels, and a presentation and final essay on a current EU-relevant political issue of their choosing.

In this college seminar course, we will dive into the world of Kamala Khan as she follows in the footsteps of her role model and the first Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers, one of the few female superheroes in the universe. She’ll change your idea of a superhero and what it means to be one as she balances her personal and superhero identity and navigates questions of race, religion, culture, power, and teenage angst.

We will explore all the abovementioned ideas and more as we read three to four volumes of Ms. Marvel comics (2014 onwards), paying attention to storytelling through the genre of sequential art. We will also watch the recent TV adaptation (2022) and finally pair the two with theories of race, Islamophobia, gender, and current world politics. Since this class also meets the writing requirement, part of your focus will be on understanding the writing process by composing varied works. For example, you’ll write short blog posts responding to questions like, “Are comics literature?”, opinion pieces that could appear in The New York Times, and fan fiction.

This course highlights the allure, the dangers, uncertainties, risks, and joys of travel expressed in student writing. What words, images, foods, music, rituals, or other sources of inspiration spark curiosity and passions that make us want to go places?

Genre analysis, writing, and transdisciplinary research projects will deepen a sense of place as the course explores the rhetoric of travel and its transformative impacts.  Students will experiment with, for instance, flash-essays, chronicles, interviews, journals, and field notes. Research projects will spotlight judicious selection of relevant sources, integration of data, and inclusion of multimodal elements. We will consider, too, the relation between travel writing and ethnography, between travel and gender, racial, religious, and ethnic components. Conveying impressions after short or extended excursions, students will recognize and develop which rhetorical strategies are appropriate for particular purposes, situations, audiences, discourse communities, and genres. Maps, films, infographics, letters, newspaper articles, guidebooks, blogs, Instagram posts, diaries, and logs constitute genres that may be examined and created. Students will further hone their craft in writing workshops, conversations, conferences, and presentations.  

Short excerpts that reflect the intimate connection between travel and writing will be discussed, and the various rhetorical strategies employed by writers such as Matsuo Basho, Tu Fu, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Olaudah Equiano, Mary Kingsley, James Baldwin, Maxine Hong Kingston, Taras Grescoe, Bill Bryson, Annie Dillard, William Least Heat-Moon, Anthony Bourdain, Eileen Myles, Binyavanga Wainaina, and Hans M.

HS5063,W27,"McKown, Jamie",Conspiracy Theories and Theories of Conspiracy,,A,"The fear of the “hidden” enemy that lurks behind the curtain, controlling events from the shadows, is a narrative topos that continually seems to raise its conspiratorial head in all kinds of spaces and venues: from politics to pop culture, movies, novels, music, political speeches,  etc.   Yet, there is also evidence to suggest that widespread acceptance of these conspiracy “theories” has the potential to cultivate and propagate inherently antidemocratic, divisive, and dangerous beliefs. Those who posit the existence of conspiracies, or at least certain ones, are often dismissed outright as irrational, without any consideration made as to the substance of their claims. Belief in conspiracies, or at least certain ones, is taken as a sign of faulty logic or reason.  Yet, despite this, conspiratorial explanations of various phenomenon actually have a long and vibrant history of popular acceptance in US political culture (as well as in other parts of the world). Some have gone so far as to suggest that narratives of conspiracy, as alternative or resistant explanatory frames, are actually a necessary component of democratic political life. After all we know that conspiracies, political and otherwise, have existed in the past, and may exist again in the future.  How do we make sense of this tension? If conspiracy theory as a mode of explanation is inherently “irrational,” what does this mean for its enduring presence in our political discourse? Is the only difference between a “reasonable” claim rooted in fear and what we consider the paranoid ramblings  of “kooks” and “nutjobs” simply a matter of which one is “correct?” Is there a silver bullet theory or magic wand that would allow us to differentiate the supposed good from the bad? Is the very act of labeling something a conspiracy theory itself a form of political hegemony? Even if conspiracies might exist, is it better to live in a world in which we  assume they don’t? What do we actually mean by conspiracy theory in the first place? This seminar will explore a variety of topics related directly to how threats of conspiracy become manifest in public discourse.  Readings will focus on secondary research that examines the role of conspiracy theories in political and social life, both in the United States and abroad. We will also supplement this with primary “artifacts” such as pamphlets, social media postings, videos, speeches, etc.   Along the way  we will also use this as an opportunity to reflect on what inter and trans disciplinary research actually looks like. The study of conspiracy narratives is an ideal example that helps us think about how different fields attempt to make sense of a phenomenon.   We will survey, compare, and attempt to synthesize research from a wide range of fields, disciplines and methodologies including those from historians, anthropologists, political scientists, legal scholars, literary critics,  psychologists, and others. This is an advanced seminar and students should expect to encounter readings that are rooted in disciplinary perspectives they are not familiar with. Students will need to adapt to shifting  perspectives in order to both the various texts  in conversation with each other.   Evaluation will be based on in-class discussion as well as individual student writing assignments. Students will produce several short length essay assignments during the term as well as a longer research paper at the end of the term.

HS4054,W27,"Cox, Gray",Philosophies of Love,,M/A,"This course investigates the intellectual history of  concepts of love that provide  origins for notions of it central in our time.  Is love the key to giving meaning to our individual lives? Is it a transformative power that can empower and heal us and our societies? How are the many different concepts of it related? To what extent are these concepts grounded in biological, historical, philosophical or spiritual truths – or mere reflections of collective myths, self delusions or manipulative deceptions?  How can we as individuals most fully realize ourselves? How can our society best promote flourishing lives and how can this be brought about? The theme of love winds like an Ariadnean thread through the labyrinth of  the history of ideas about the nature of  self, Other, community, knowledge, reality and ethics. The class uses overview materials from intellectual historians like de Rougemont,  Singer and May. It picks away through central passages in that labyrinth by reading key selections from Plato,  New Testament writers, Medieval poets, Nietzsche, de Beauvoir, Irigary, Gandhi, King, Levinas, Thich Nhat Hanh, Mortimer-Sandilands, pop culture and others. Class format relies on seminar discussion with occasional short lectures. Goals of the course are to advance students’ abilities to critically analyze texts in context in intellectual history, and to advance understanding of nuanced ways key ideas in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and social-change theories inform and are informed by concepts including: eros, philia, agape, courtly love (fin amour), love force/satyagraha, romantic love, ahimsa, and compassion.

Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This advanced studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking by experimenting with conventional and non-traditional ways of creating a range of matrices. Students will acquire skills as printmakers with an emphasis on multiple-plate, collagraph, and other advanced techniques. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper – engaging with more complex discourses of representation.

Tracing musical and political histories through a series of case studies routed throughout the diaspora, this course aims to develop a theory of “the Black Atlantic” as a sonic geography. After establishing a foundation in the key historical forces leading to the creation of the African diaspora, students will explore case studies related to the development of local and transnational musical styles from salsa to hip-hop, funk, reggae and more. We will explore the intersecting work of artists (such as Janelle Monae, Angélique Kidjo, Fela Kuti, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and Bob Marley) and scholars (such as Paul Gilroy, Angela Davis, Amiri Baraka, and Michael Veal). Equal weight in the course will be given to reading, listening, and writing as valuable modes of interacting with music. Throughout the course of the term, students will learn to listen more closely to sound and to develop a critical capacity for relating these sounds to the political and social worlds from which they emerge.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.

Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended. Evaluation will be based on how the specific criteria set for each assignment are met, participation and engagement during critiques, and receptivity to feedback.

How can we electrify climate solutions to meet these urgent targets? What steps are needed to eliminate fossil fuel consumption, and how quickly can we implement them? To maintain the habitability of the planet, we have no choice but to win the carbon endgame. This course will discuss the technical requirements of the clean energy transition, including beneficial electrification, energy efficiency and renewable energy, but the emphasis will be on societal shifts needed to accelerate economy-wide decarbonization. Students will examine how fossil fuel corporations have lied about their impacts on the climate for decades, and how that has influenced policies and funding programs. This course will focus on readings, reflection and discussion. Topics covered will include the social, environmental, and economic impacts of fossil fuels versus renewable energy. Students will examine the role of diverse economic sectors including real estate, finance, and education in this transition. Students will explore the facets of transitioning an entire town or neighborhood away from fossil fuels, and the benefits or challenges associated with planning and implementing projects at a larger scale than an individual home. How can we completely transition off fossil fuels within a generation? Students who successfully complete this course will be able to identify the steps to transition a building off fossil fuels, and have a conversational understanding of how various economic sectors are critical to support the global clean energy transition.

ES1076,W27,"Todd, Sean",Polar Ecology and Exploration,,I,"The Arctic and Antarctic represent some of the most extreme environments on the planet. As physical places, both poles play an important role in governing the planet’s climate and heat flow. Both are suspected to be rich in minerals and are thought to perhaps hold short-term relief from current world shortages in natural resources. As ecosystems, both are hugely productive in spite of, and in part because of the extreme temperatures they experience; certain species are found nowhere else and in fact thrive in these remote locales. Superimposed upon these natural environments is the presence of humans. Exploration of both areas has been particularly focused in the past century, with countless stories of the perseverance and persistence of our pioneering spirit. Initially surveyed to forward nationalistic agendas, both poles are now sites of scientific inquiry. In particular, the political model that currently governs Antarctica as one massive Protected Area has no precedent and perhaps suggests a way forward for environmental agendas working on global scales. More recently, the poles have been exploited by ecotourism businesses.

This class examines the provinces of the Arctic and Antarctic, wildernesses whose boundaries can be defined physically, biologically, geologically and politically. We will examine the rich and highly adapted diversity of life as it is affected by local and global oceanography and atmospheric science, and assess the impacts of climate change on these fragile environments. We will also review our relationship with these places and examine what future we might play in preserving, and/or exploiting the polar regime, using Human Ecology as a model for our understanding. Evaluation will be by two term papers and participation in class activities.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.

We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. 

Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.

Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.

Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others. Students will also select a longer text to read from a list of authors that may include Jonathan Safran Foer, Susan Cain, Felicia Rose Chavez, Claudia Rankine, and others.

HS4110,S27,"Taneja, Palak",Setting Sail with Amitav Ghosh or TBD,,M/A,"“For him it meant that everything which existed was interconnected: the trees, the sky, the weather, people, poetry, science, nature. He hunted down facts in the way a magpie collects shiny things. Yet when he strung them all together, somehow they did become stories — of a kind.”
-Amitav Ghosh, The Hungry Tide

Amitav Ghosh uses the words above to describe one of his characters, but the same words could be used for him. A prominent postcolonial writer in English with a background in social anthropology, Amitav Ghosh has long written about the world's interconnectedness in both his fiction and nonfiction. His works are not just stories but reflections on how the past shapes the present and the future and how memories of the past, long forgotten, can teach us how to deal with the issues that plague us now, like climate change.

This course, then, will be a deep dive into his magnum opus, the Ibis trilogy: The Sea of Poppies (2008), The River of Smoke (2011), and The Flood of Fire (2015).  As we set sail on the Indian Ocean, journeying alongside the crew of Ibis, we will explore the intricate web of connections brought forward by the themes of subalternity, colonialization, trade, wars, and the environment. While our focus will be on the novels, we will also look at some of the author’s nonfictional work, like Smoke and Ashes: Opium’s Hidden Histories (2023), which will provide an understanding of the context but also the depth of his research that culminated into three key pieces of literature.

This will be a reading-intensive class appropriate for students interested in fiction, history, and languages (some languages that appear are Bengali, Hindi, Bhojpuri, Persian, Cantonese, Chinese Pidgin, and Mauritian Creole). A background in literary/critical theory and familiarity with Ghosh’s other works will be helpful, though not required. You will be evaluated through class discussions and written assignments such as short responses, an oral presentation, a 10-12 page critical analysis paper, and a multimodal project.

The remote Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador presents a stunning landscape, an astoundingly rich ecological setting, and a tragic history of poverty amidst an incredible natural resource, the northern cod fishery, that was ultimately destroyed. The province has been alternately invaded or occupied by different groups of Native Americans along with Norseman, Basques, French, British, and the U.S. military, because of its strategic location and rich fishing and hunting grounds. One of the first and one of the last British colonies, this richest of fisheries produced a very class based society, composed of a wealthy few urban merchants and an highly exploited population of fishing families often living on the edge of survival. But within the past 50 years, Newfoundland society has been forced to evolve. The provincial government looks towards oil and mineral exploitation to turn around the economy, while ex-fishermen consider eco- and cultural tourism with growing ambivalence. This then is our setting, and background, for an intense examination of the human ecology of this province; the relationship between humans and their environment, sometimes successful, sometimes otherwise, the struggle between the tenuous grasp of civilization and this marvelous, terrible place. To do this we will discuss various readings, examine case studies and review the natural and human history of this unique province.  Our learning will culminate with a two-week trip to Newfoundland to examine its issues firsthand.  Evaluation will be based on class and field trip participation, responses to reading questions, a field journal, and a final project.

Thinking about the natural world with this level of abstraction has provided critical insights into the processes that support life on Earth, the feedbacks that connect the geosphere and atmosphere to the biosphere, and the ways life is likely to respond to large-scale perturbations such as climate change. In this course, we will explore the deep history of life on earth and how living things have transformed the chemistry of the planet. We will study how energy flows and nutrients cycle in present-day ecosystems, and how these processes are coupled and regulated by the actions of living organisms. Using examples from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, we will study how to quantify fluxes of energy and matter. We will analyze the factors that affect rates of ecosystem processes such as plant growth and decomposition in different ecoregions. We will explore the feedbacks that link living and non-living matter into a single complex network. The drivers and ramifications of climate change will be a recurring theme throughout the term.

Using historic makers for inspiration some slide lectures will be included, but each student will be expected to do some research on their own to find inspiration from other artists. Being inclusive of various aesthetics, we’ll explore differing expressions of beauty and students will be expected to engage ways of working outside their own comfort zone. Readings by Rebecca Solnit, Lucy Lippard, Frank Gohlke, Deborah Bright, Robert Adams, Richard Misrach, John Stilgoe, Bill McKibben, and Geoffrey Batchen, among others, will inform our discussions. Weekly shooting assignments, and readings will be expected prior to mid term. After mid term, you will work toward one final project that explores your own personal expressive choices based on your interests and affinities. These final projects will be displayed publicly, if possible, during week ten. Some prior experience with Adobe Lightroom Classic or Photoshop is highly recommended.

ES4066,S27,"Gadeken, Kara",Estuaries,,M/A,"The simplest definition of an estuary is a place along a coast where freshwater and saltwater meet; however, estuaries are far from simple. They are complex systems driven by a fascinating network of interactions and feedbacks. This course offers a comprehensive exploration of estuaries as complex systems, integrating their physical, chemical, biological, and ecological processes. We will cover advanced topics such as estuarine hydrodynamics, sediment transport, productivity, ecosystem function, and biogeochemical cycling. Every estuary is different and throughout the course we will examine case studies of different estuaries, developing a global perspective on their variety. After building a foundation of knowledge on estuarine processes, we will explore how these systems respond to perturbation, how they exercise resilience, and how pivotal features of estuarine networks can be drastically altered by human activities. Estuaries are at the intersection of myriad anthropogenic influences and are critical environments supporting human survival, health and happiness. Together we will explore the various ways that humans interact with and affect these systems.

We meet twice a week for in-class work, and once every other week for an extended afternoon lab session when we go on field trips to explore local estuaries. The course also involves one required weekend field trip to a far off-site estuarine system. Assessment in the course will be based on case study problem sets, reading responses, and a term project.

This course is intended as an advanced offering for students interested in environmental research, management, and/or restoration. A solid background in marine biology, environmental science, or related disciplines is essential to succeed in the course. Experience and comfort with mathematics (particularly the basics of calculus) will also be very beneficial. If you are unsure of whether you have the math skill set for this course, I encourage you to reach out to me.

With the federal government tied up in partisan gridlock, some of the most meaningful climate and energy legislation in recent decades has occurred at the state level. We will examine how bills move through the Legislature from the draft stage to the final version that is voted on by the House and Senate. Students will learn about the ways that the public and professional lobbyists can engage at nearly every stage of the process. Course participants will be introduced to a variety of environmental non-profits, including Sierra Club Maine, Maine Youth for Climate Justice, and the Environmental Priorities Coalition, and learn how they work both independently and collaboratively to advocate for legislation. While this course is Maine-specific, many of the advocacy skills used in public processes may be applicable in other contexts, including municipal, county, and national decision-making. Some of these skills include conducting policy research and analysis, understanding the legislative process, and developing clear written communication. We will read past legislation relating to energy policy, fossil fuel divestment, and tribal sovereignty and discuss why they were successful or not, and whether there were unintended consequences for bills that passed. Students will be required to identify 3 draft bills they find meaningful, draft testimony to present at the public hearing, and work collaboratively with classmates and/or nonprofit organizations to advocate for those issues as they proceed through the legislative process. The course will include at least two weekday field trips to Augusta to attend public hearings and meet with legislators in person.

Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions, completion of written assignments, engagement with the material and demonstration of working knowledge of the legislative process.

Maintaining a sketchbook can be both a professionally useful and personally rewarding practice. This multidisciplinary course will encourage students to develop a regular sketchbook practice using animals as the focus of study. It is intended for any student who wishes to improve their sketching and observational skills, gain an understanding of animal anatomy, and learn about local animal life. Students will draw from museum specimens, taxidermy mounts, and live animals using a variety of media and techniques suitable for field sketching. Class will take place in the Dorr Museum and at field sites within Acadia National Park and Hancock County.

This course will meet for two three hour sessions per week. The first session will include a lesson about a particular animal taxon, followed by sketching exercises using museum specimens and mounts as references. In the second session, students will draw from live animals in the field. Students will also spend approximately nine hours per week outside of class on additional field sketching assignments, readings, and research.

Evaluations will emphasize participation and student growth rather than artistic ability. Our focus will be on practice and learning to effectively record observations, not on creating polished illustrations. Prior experience with drawing is not required.

HS1102,F27,"McKown, Jamie","Equal Rights, Equal Voices: Articulating Suffrage",,I,"This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century woman suffrage activists in the United States. This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott,  Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who are generally less well known today. While this is a course rooted in the history of what we might consider early American feminism, it should come as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront issues that continue to have salience today.  Many of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity, equality, empowerment, and political allyship that these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant for us to consider in our contemporary context.  This is especially true when it comes to the topic of race and the intersectional nature of the discourse around gender equality, both then and now. We will spend time examining how the idea of race was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and inclusionary ways, within these texts.  We will also look specifically at the works of early Black feminists in the United States, and the myriad of ways they  navigated the challenges of the moment, especially as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of white supremacy within the early woman suffrage movement.   Rather than rely primarily on secondary historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials, mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers “in their own words.” In addition, students will also take part in “hands on” recovery projects designed to locate, transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible works  from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring and making effective use of various types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in recent years. Class sessions will be organized as a discussed based seminar.  Assignments will emphasize critical, reflective, and analytical writing. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, short written response papers, two longer form take-home essays, individual presentations, and a final “recovery” project. Students interested in topics related to gender, politics, historical research, and activism are especially encouraged to enroll. This is an introductory class and open to all students regardless of whether they have a previous background in feminism, social theory, US history, or politics.

In this college seminar course, we will dive into the world of Kamala Khan as she follows in the footsteps of her role model and the first Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers, one of the few female superheroes in the universe. She’ll change your idea of a superhero and what it means to be one as she balances her personal and superhero identity and navigates questions of race, religion, culture, power, and teenage angst.

We will explore all the abovementioned ideas and more as we read three to four volumes of Ms. Marvel comics (2014 onwards), paying attention to storytelling through the genre of sequential art. We will also watch the recent TV adaptation (2022) and finally pair the two with theories of race, Islamophobia, gender, and current world politics. Since this class also meets the writing requirement, part of your focus will be on understanding the writing process by composing varied works. For example, you’ll write short blog posts responding to questions like, “Are comics literature?”, opinion pieces that could appear in The New York Times, and fan fiction. All these are different genres and targeted at a specific audience, me, online readers, fans, and your peers.

This course highlights the allure, the dangers, uncertainties, risks, and joys of travel expressed in student writing. What words, images, foods, music, rituals, or other sources of inspiration spark curiosity and passions that make us want to go places?

Genre analysis, writing, and transdisciplinary research projects will deepen a sense of place as the course explores the rhetoric of travel and its transformative impacts.  Students will experiment with, for instance, flash-essays, chronicles, interviews, journals, and field notes. Research projects will spotlight judicious selection of relevant sources, integration of data, and inclusion of multimodal elements. We will consider, too, the relation between travel writing and ethnography, between travel and gender, racial, religious, and ethnic components. Conveying impressions after short or extended excursions, students will recognize and develop which rhetorical strategies are appropriate for particular purposes, situations, audiences, discourse communities, and genres. Maps, films, infographics, letters, newspaper articles, guidebooks, blogs, Instagram posts, diaries, and logs constitute genres that may be examined and created. Students will further hone their craft in writing workshops, conversations, conferences, and presentations.  

Short excerpts that reflect the intimate connection between travel and writing will be discussed, and the various rhetorical strategies employed by writers such as Matsuo Basho, Tu Fu, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Olaudah Equiano, Mary Kingsley, James Baldwin, Maxine Hong Kingston, Taras Grescoe, Bill Bryson, Annie Dillard, William Least Heat-Moon, Anthony Bourdain, Eileen Myles, Binyavanga Wainaina, and Hans M.

HS1120,F27,"Van Vliet, Netta",Introduction to Cultural Anthropology,,I,"This course is an introduction to some of the central questions, arguments, and concepts of Cultural Anthropology. Broadly defined, “cultural anthropology” is the study of human cultures. Historically, such study has focused on explorations of difference through conducting fieldwork over an extended period of time in a specific community. Understandings of the discipline have changed over time, from definitions of it as an objective social science in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when anthropology was dominated by European and U.S. anthropologists conducting fieldwork in places in Africa, Latin America and Asia, to definitions of it as a subjective interpretative social science that has been transformed and critiqued by anthropologists across the globe studying a wide range of human cultures and institutions, including their own societies. In the 1970s and 1980s, anthropologists began to “study up” through focusing on cultures of entities such as the World Bank, corporations, the military, scientists and investment bankers. Today, almost anything can be a focus for anthropological study.

In this class we will address questions and arguments about structure, difference, power, colonialism, politics, representation and responsibility, both in terms of cultural anthropology’s own formation as a colonial discipline, and in terms of the tools for critical thinking that have emerged out of anthropological work. What kinds of social organization and economic systems tie people together? What produces conflict? What is the significance of myths, rituals and symbols? How are social systems reproduced over time? How do they change? What is the significance of relations of identification and interaction between individuals and group categories? What are the political implications of how the human is defined? As we learn about how different thinkers have engaged these questions, we will also critically examine the concepts that inform them, including ideas of agency, responsibility, representation and action. Texts will likely include work by Ruth Benedict, Lee D. Baker, Franz Boas, Jacques Derrida, Emile Durkheim, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Clifford Geertz, Zora Neale Hurston, Alfred Kroeber, Claude Levi-Strauss, Karl Marx, Sidney Mintz, Rosalind Morris, Anand Pandian, Gayle Rubin, Marshall Sahlins, Edward Said, Marilyn Strathern, Deborah Thomas, Michel-Rolph Trouillot, Victor Turner, and Eric Wolf. Course work will include engaging with ethnographic writing and ethnographic research methods, as well as with transdisciplinary encounters with anthropology, including work in literature, philosophy, feminist and postcolonial theory. Students will be evaluated on individual and small group ethnographic research and writing assignments, class participation, and weekly reading responses.

The course centers on the questions: What would it take to ensure access to healthy, safe, affordable, culturally appropriate foods for all people? The first part of the course critically examines capitalist food systems with particular attention to the ways culture, politics, and economics shape our interactions with food. Through readings and exercises, we explore issues such as nutrition, worker safety, contested agricultural and land use policies, hunger, and environmental and community health. The second part of the course examines case studies of transformative food movements around the world, from the Zero Hunger programs in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to La Via Campesina global campaign for agrarian reform. We focus particularly on food sovereignty and agroecology movements. The final third of the course focuses on transformative work in Maine and at COA. Students take multiple field trips to participate in local movements and to learn about their philosophies, objectives, and activities. By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze how power shapes food systems and articulate a theory of change for addressing a food systems problem of their choice. Students are evaluated based on participation in class discussions and field trips, a series of reflection papers, and a final project including a paper and an audio-visual presentation.

Sixty percent of Maine homes are heated with heating oil, the highest percentage of any state, and Mainers spend more than a billion dollars on heating oil each year. Improving the efficiency of our homes and buildings is essential for transitioning away from fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions.

In this course, students will learn how to safely transition buildings away from fossil fuels. This includes understanding the science of energy and moisture movement through a building, how to monitor carbon monoxide and other harmful combustion gases, and methods to reduce energy loss, while maintaining comfortable levels of humidity and fresh air. Students will gain proficiency measuring air leakage with a blower door, using an infrared camera to assess insulation levels, calculating heat loss, and identifying solutions and best practices to develop a plan of action for homeowners.

They will also learn about high efficiency mechanical systems like air source heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and how to assess lighting and appliance electrical usage. Students will learn how to carry out cost calculations for energy savings and research and share information on rebates and incentives available for homeowners. This will be a very hands-on course, with weekly labs to teach energy auditing field skills. This course will include presentations from local energy contractors, and students will participate in energy audits of residential buildings on or off campus. Through these experiences, students will meet and interact with home performance businesses and non-profit organizations in the local community. As time and weather conditions permit, students will gain experience implementing efficiency solutions such as insulation and air sealing.

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to conduct energy audits for homes, identify cost-effective improvements, and prioritize energy improvements to maximize energy savings. This course will provide students with the tools and experience to reduce building energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in a holistic, whole-building approach.

Evaluation will be based on completion of assignments, participation in class discussions, and mastery of field skills.

It is unique among ecosystems in that it condenses and concentrates many ecological processes along a strong physiological gradient, and so serves as an ideal environment to observe and investigate fundamental ecological principles.

In this course, you will be introduced to the many diverse intertidal ecosystems of coastal Maine, from rocky shorelines to tidal mudflats to salt marshes. Through discussions in class and observations in the field, we will endeavor to answer the questions:

What organisms are found in the intertidal, and how are they adapted to life there?
How is the distribution of intertidal organisms dictated by living in a transitional environment?
How do intertidal organisms interact with each other, and how does this shape the community?

We meet twice per week for class time with one afternoon lab period. During lab time we will be going on field trips as much as possible to explore the local intertidal habitats. This course is intended as an accessible introduction to marine community ecology and field work. Assessment is based on weekly question sets, lab assignments, and a short research proposal.

Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.

AD4046,F27,"Sebastian, Neeraj",Drawing Intensive/Developing a Studio Practice,,M/A,"In the first part of this course, drawing will be used to experiment, interrogate and expand different aspects of one’s artistic practice. Using a broad range of materials, students are encouraged to work intuitively and take multiple approaches to presenting ideas–especially ideas that may not have been explored previously in their work–and develop them in different ways. Students will create large quantities of drawings based on prompts that will then be discussed with the class. What stands out? What makes a piece surprising or interesting? What revisions can be made to strengthen these moments or motifs? These are kinds of questions that will inform our discussions.

Taken together, these drawings will offer a broad range of possibilities that will then be explored for the rest of the term, during which students will develop a body of work. Students will meet weekly as a group to discuss work made or advanced in the previous week and meet individually with the instructor every other week to discuss materials and other aspects of their art practices. The work made over the course of the term should include material investigation (why are you using the materials you’re using and how does it support your thematic interests?) and embody a range of conceptual concerns. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to several artists’ working methods. Students are expected to work independently and have some degree of familiarity with the materials they choose to work with.

“Drawing” is used broadly here: students working in any medium are encouraged to take this course (for example, a student interested in three-dimensional work might respond to the prompts with forms made from cardboard or other found materials). This course is designed to kickstart a nascent practice or one that might have become dormant or plateaued as well as give students room to experiment and then build on these experiments. Students enrolling in this class should have some form of previous studio experience.   Evaluation will be based on students’ work, participation in class discussions, the ability to offer critical and constructive feedback to one’s peers, and the ability to push oneself beyond one’s comfort zone or perceived limitations—especially when it comes to allowing the work to evolve and change in response to feedback and critique.

Griffith, pioneer of early cinema, prophesied in 1924 that by 2024 cinema would have been instrumental in ""eliminating from the face of the civilized world all armed conflict"".  Where have things gone wrong? Cinema is a powerful medium that in many ways is still struggling to find its place among the other arts; there are many promising byways that have been overlooked or under-explored.  This course explores the histories, production and meanings of motion pictures. Using various films as case studies, we will look at the development of film forms, techniques and genres from 1946 to the present - the second half of cinema history.  Films studied will include examples of narrative, documentary, animation, and the avant-garde.  Students will learn concepts of film analysis and criticism, and will have opportunities to practice critical skills in class discussions and in research and writing assignments. Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation in class discussion, written papers, and research presentations.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.

We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. 

Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.

Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.

Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others. Students will also select a longer text to read from a list of authors that may include Jonathan Safran Foer, Susan Cain, Felicia Rose Chavez, Claudia Rankine, and others.

Students will be evaluated on class participation, written assignments, writing process, and presentations.

HS1094,W28,"McKown, Jamie",Public Speaking Workshop,,I,"Consider all the ways that public speaking could be a part of your academic and professional paths: presenting your research, sitting on a webinar panel, speaking up at ACM, advocating for an urgent cause or policy, preparing your senior project presentation, delivering a formal address at a special occasion, or even deciding to perform spoken word at an open-mic. This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.  Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly.  This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations  while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for  public communication.  Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits.  The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other.  This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches.  Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation.  All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course.  This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches.

Taking a multifaceted view of human relationships with nature, students will generate research projects driven by questions about tourism and eco-tourism, species population change, climate degradation, the role of technology, and development of wildlands and waterways. Research discussed in class will also center on environmental values and challenges expressed by ecocritics, naturalists, biologists, philosophers, archaeologists, psychologists, poets, filmmakers, and others from the nineteenth century to the present. Several local excursions will provide opportunities for taking field notes. Students will be encouraged to experiment with different forms of writing, expanding their genre analysis, rhetorical awareness, and research practices, while deepening their own relationship with nature.

HS2128,W28,"Van Vliet, Netta","Authoritarianism, Conflict, Collaboration",,I/M,"This course draws on multiple disciplines and interdisciplinary fields (anthropology, literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, history, postcolonial and feminist studies) to explore questions about authoritarian and anti-authoritarian contexts and practices. Authoritarianism, broadly defined, is characterized by centralized power, repression of dissent, and pressure to obey authority. Dictatorship, totalitarianism, and fascism all name forms of authoritarian regimes. It can be easy to recognize authoritarianism when it has become established in such forms. But what does it look, feel and sound like in terms of how it can infiltrate our daily systems? In this class, we will consider how authoritarianism can take hold through looking at dynamics of power in the relations, discourses and structures that make up everyday sites such as the home, family, the school, places of worship, and the workplace. On the flip side, we will also consider examples of collaboration in contexts of conflict and disagreement. What does working (and learning, teaching, and living) together in contexts of conflict, and with multiple forms of difference and disagreement, involve? The course will include attention to the significance of the nation-state as a form of political organization that dominates the globe today. We will also consider examples of social and political movements that have emerged in response to state repression in the 20th and 21st centuries in different parts of the world, as well as contemporary discourses about racism and anti-racism, sexual violence, war, capitalism and economic power, and disagreement and conflict.

Some of the questions we will examine over the term include: How do we understand relations between truth and power (and how are these terms defined)? How do we know what we think we know (epistemology)? What is structural power? What is the significance of relations between individual and group for how we respond to tensions between “individual freedom” and “collective or community wellbeing”? What is the significance of private/public distinctions for politics? Course materials will likely include work by Louis Althusser, Nur Amali Ibrahim, Benedict Anderson, Hannah Arendt, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Verónica Gago, Adolf Hitler, William Mazzarella, George Orwell, Edward Said, Carl Schmitt, Timothy Snyder, Gayatri Spivak and Luisa Valenzuela, among others. We will also draw on contemporary news, social media and film. Students will be evaluated based on small group projects, weekly reading responses, and a mid-term paper.

HS2081,W28,"Van Vliet, Netta",Postcolonial Studies and Psychoanalysis,,I/M,"The course considers the definition of the human by bringing together the field of postcolonial studies with the field of psychoanalysis. Both postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis engage questions of sexualized and racialized difference in the context of 20th century Europe and the legacies of colonialism. Postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis both also contend with notions of individual and collective well-being, with belonging and exclusion. 

Psychoanalysis is a colonial discipline which produced a form of analysis that emerged in the time of colonialism. As such, psychoanalysis contributed to colonial notions of civilized and primitive, of man and woman, of normal and abnormal, of Europe and its others. At the same time, however, contexts of anticolonial struggle in turn shaped psychoanalytic thought. By examining texts central to these two fields, this course considers how psychoanalytic thought can help us understand the processes through which individuated subjects become defined in terms of collective groups of belonging such as the nation, and how filiation and family is connected to affiliation and nation, through relations of affect and concepts of representational politics.

We will begin with an introduction to the inception of psychoanalysis in Europe, and examine how it travels and is taken up in Europe’s colonies. Drawing on postcolonial theory and literature, we will learn about the historical emergence of the term “postcolonial,” the political and disciplinary debates to which the term gave rise, and its relation to ideas of nationalism, diaspora, Orientalism. Geographically, we will examine examples of anticolonial struggle in Algeria, India, and Palestine/Israel. Readings will focus on texts by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida, the Subaltern Studies group, and scholars who directly engage with these thinkers, including Jacques Lacan, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Gayatri Spivak. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, reading responses, a mid-term essay and final paper.

The course begins by acknowledging the historical realities that limited women’s narrative options in the publishing industry until quite recently. We will examine a relatively unknown yet rather extraordinary short novel from 1967:  Sawako Ariyoshi’s The Doctor’s Wife.  After Ariyoshi, we will read from quite varied authors published within the last fifty years, writers such as:  Buchi Emecheta, Clarice Lispector, Nawal El Saadawi, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Hanan al-Shaykh, Jeannette Winterson, Rose Tremain, Nora Okja Keller, Fadia Faqir, and Yvonne Vera. We will also read some classic and contemporary feminist literary theory to gain a sense of how feminist scholars approach women’s novels and our questions. The course is especially designed for students interested in women’s and gender issues who have had some previous experience with literary analysis, close reading of texts, and/or feminist theory. As one way to do the work of an intermediate/advanced class, each student will choose an additional author to investigate, either a novelist or theorist who has published since 2000, and read a novel or theoretical essay by this author outside of class. Students will be evaluated based on class engagement, response papers, passage analyses, a presentation to the class of the outside novel or theory and the questions it raises, and a final evaluation essay.

HS1065,W28,"Lakey, Heather",Philosophies of Good and Evil,,I,"Good and evil are timeless topics and they have motivated centuries of philosophical thinking. Although the terms “good” and “evil” are commonly used across a range of discourses, they are ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In an effort to explore different ideas about good and evil, this course provides a broad overview of the issues, arguments, and debates that shape philosophical ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What are the origins of good and evil? What makes an action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What should we do with someone who commits a horrific act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? What kinds of ethical theories operate without the concepts of good and evil? Is evil an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of good and evil help or hinder moral thinking?

To critically unpack these questions, we will read works by ethical thinkers including Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, Hannah Arendt, Zhuangzi, Simone de Beauvoir, Abû Nasr al-Fârâbî, Nell Noddings, Peter Singer, Kwame Gyekye, Mencius, Sherman Alexie, and others. Along the way, we will study deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, ethical relativism, feminist ethics, Taoism, and existential ethics. In addition, we will unpack the ethical arguments that orbit concrete topics such as execution, murder, moral character, racial injustice, and our ethical duties to one another.

This course will familiarize students with the influential frameworks of ethical philosophy, and it will encourage students to apply these frameworks to specific ethical problems. Course requirements include class participation, three short papers, a reflection essay, and a final paper or project. There are no prerequisites for this course, but students should be prepared to engage with difficult, philosophical texts and to discuss these texts in class.

However, the science of restoration is still in its early phases, and important theoretical and practical questions remain to be resolved. This class will critically examine the assumptions that underlie restoration planning, both in the ethical dimension and in the realm of scientific theory. We will consider the validity of conceptual models of ecological communities and ecosystems and the way that these models shape decision-making. We will survey the factors that must be taken into account during restoration and study best-practices approaches, with a focus on adaptive management. In the final project, groups of students will develop and present restoration plans for a local site. Students will be evaluated based on two essays, class participation, and the final project.

ES2050,W28,"Gadeken, Kara",Deep Sea Biology,,I/M,"Most of the ocean is deep, dark, and cold – conditions that at first glance appear terribly inhospitable. And yet the past century and a half of deep-ocean exploration has revealed an astonishing abundance and diversity of life, with forms and functions that, though seemingly alien, reflect exquisite adaptation to the unique challenges of surviving in such an environment. Our expanding knowledge about the deep ocean is only possible with the boundary-pushing technologies and instruments developed to delve deeper, see further, and collect more from the most remote depths. As we have learned more about the ecosystems in the deep ocean, it has also become clear that human activities are not so removed from them as we once believed. Discussions about deep ocean biology now include debates about our obligation to protect and conserve it.

In this course, we will take a tour of the variety of life that exists in the deep ocean, learn about how we observe and study it, and discuss the ways that humans interact with and affect it. Our guiding questions for the course are:

What kinds of life exist in different deep ocean ecosystems?
How are deep sea organisms adapted to life in an environment of extremes?
What technologies are used to study life in the deep ocean and what are their capabilities and constraints?
What do we owe to life in the deep ocean in terms of conservation?
What do we owe to human society in terms of deep-ocean exploration, discovery, and resource use?

We meet twice a week in class and have one afternoon lab period. Classes are a combination of lecture, discussion and activities, and labs focus on one or two elements of deep-sea biology for deeper investigation as a group. This course is open to anyone but is particularly suited for students interested in marine studies, ecology, evolutionary biology, and/or environmental ethics. Students will be assessed based on short research assignments throughout the course and a term project.

HS2096,W28,"Lakey, Heather","Nature, Humans, and Philosophy",,I/M,"According to COA’s website, Human Ecology studies the relationships between humans and their natural and social environments. But what do we mean by “nature,” and what distinguishes a natural environment from a social one? Moreover, what kinds of relationships should we cultivate with our natural environments? This discussion-based course explores the concepts of nature and environmental responsibility across different philosophical and cultural frameworks. We will draw on a variety of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism, deep ecology, American transcendentalism, indigenous studies, queer theory, and Buddhism. We will read selections from thinkers such as John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, Arne Naess, Val Plumwood, Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau, Eduardo Kohn, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Thich Nhat Hanh, Anna Tsing, and others. 

Guiding questions include the following: What is nature? How is the idea of nature politicized and socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations to nature? How should humans relate to nature? What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction between humans and nature? Although this course will focus primarily on theoretical questions, we will also discuss issues in applied ethics such as, control over natural resources, wilderness preservation, sustainability, and consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit questions pertaining to environmental activism, and we will consider how philosophy can help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities and obligations. 

Upon completion of this course, students will have gained a richer philosophical understanding of the idea of nature and they will be familiar with key debates in environmental ethics. Course requirements include weekly writing assignments, a midterm exam, a final paper, and class participation.

HS1097,S28,"Lakey, Heather",Buddhist Philosophies,,I,"What is the nature of self? What is the nature of mind? Why do we suffer? What is enlightenment? This course introduces students to the foundations of Buddhist philosophy and practice. Buddhism encompasses a variety of different traditions, teachings, practices, and goals. In this class, we will adopt a philosophical perspective to explore a range of Buddhist thinking on topics such as reality, consciousness, nothingness, and ethical conduct. 

We will begin by reading Asvagho?a's Buddhacarita, which tells the story of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha. Next, we will study the Theravada, Buddhism's foundational structure, and then proceed to explore the later Mahayana teachings. This course will study primary literature, including excerpts from the Pali Canon and several Mahayana sutras, alongside selections from contemporary thinkers such as Thích Nhat Hanh, angel Kyodo williams, and Pema Chödrön. Along the way, we will discuss suffering (dukkha), emptiness (suññata), impermanence (anicca), non-self (anatta), interdependence or dependent uprising (pa?iccasamuppada), desire (tanha), the four noble truths, the eightfold path, liberation and enlightenment (nibbana), action and causation (kamma), wisdom (pañña), compassion (karuna and bodhicitta), and our responsibilities to other beings. 

Although this course primarily focuses on Buddhist theory and Buddhist texts, students will be briefly introduced to different meditation and mindfulness practices through a series of guest speakers and a weekend visit to the Morgan Bay Zendo in Surry, Maine. This course will be conducted in seminar style with an emphasis on class participation. No prior background in Buddhism or philosophy is required.

How does the moral treatment of animals change across the contexts of food, research, captivity, and the home? Historically, western philosophers construct the animal in opposition to the human. Why? What is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted with it? How does language shape and produce our relationships with animals? How is the animal represented and characterized, and how does this representation impact our thinking about animal ethics?

This discussion-based course explores the relationships between humans and non-human animals. Drawing on fiction, philosophy, and ethology, we will examine our beliefs and assumptions regarding animals, human-animal relations, and the ethical implications of the human-animal binary. This course will focus on a wide range of theoretical approaches, including the traditions of animal liberation and animal rights as articulated by thinkers such as Tom Regan and Peter Singer, the growing field of animal studies as represented by thinkers like Jacques Derrida, and current debates in practical ethics, such as animal experimentation, hunting, and invasive species.

Upon completion of the course, students will have refined their understanding of the concept of the animal and they will be familiar with the key legal and ethical debates regarding human-animal relationships. Course requirements include class discussions, weekly writing exercises, a midterm exam, and a final paper or project. Students should come to this class prepared to read challenging philosophical essays and to share their ideas with others.

HS2091,S28,"Mahoney, Dan",Forms of Poetry,,I/M,"This class is a study of, and a writing workshop in, poetic forms.  We will look at constraints, techniques, and directions of contemporary poetry through intensive reading, writing, and criticism of our own poetic work.  This background is useful and significant for the study of poetry at any level, and is especially helpful in light of the fact that, for better or worse, free verse techniques have dominated poetry in the twentieth century.  This course is valuable for practiced poets, emerging poets, and prose writers alike. Forms of Poetry asks students to pay attention, create poetry of attention, and revel in poetry that is attentive to language; this process will help students develop voice and lyrical content in their own writing. We will look older, “received forms” (Sonnet, Ghazal, Villanelle) and create our own forms by using experimental techniques (homophonic translation, concrete poetry, erasure, nonsense words (i.e. Jabberwocky)) and look to end the term with the amazing Japanese form, Zuihitsu. You might be thinking: Why write with these crazy constraints or in these old timey poetic forms? And what the heck is a Zuihitsu? Those are good questions, questions we will address on a weekly basis.  Over the last seventy years, the debates over poetic expression have been shaped in visceral ways, from “raw” versus “cooked,” “academic” versus “beat,” “formal” versus “antiformal.”  This class is designed to deepen your knowledge of these debates and to inspire you to draw upon a variety of modes in your own writing.  Evaluations:  Students will be expected to contribute to a class blog, write several poems a week, revise poetic output, participate in class workshop, and hand sew a chapbook of their own revised, creative work.

Beginning in the 1940’s and leading up to Richard Nixon's election in 1968 we will examine the diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and how this relationship has impacted state actors, economic policies, cultural production, and conceptions of identity. While there will be a heavy focus on traditional state-level diplomatic history, students will also explore a broad array of methodological approaches. Class sessions will include a mix of traditional lecture formats, class discussion, and outside presentations. An evening lab is scheduled in order to screen a variety of cultural artifacts from the various periods we will cover. The primary goal is to give students an intensive 10-week crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.. that defined the early decades of Cold War diplomacy. At the same time there is also time allocated for students to explore their own independent research interests. Given the far-reaching force of Cold War politics into everyday life, individuals with widely varying academic interests will find the course informative and productive.

Deemed as one of the Great Books of the 20th century, which won the Booker prize the year of its publication, 1981, and the Booker of Bookers twice over (in 1993 and 2008), the novel is a prime example of postcolonialism with a magical realist twist.
In this class, we will take a deep dive into Rushdie’s novel by paying close attention to the prose and his style and the history and contexts that he sets up in this novel. Therefore, the reading of the novel will be supplemented with historical background and literary criticism that bring up questions of utopia, nation, politics, identity, and subalternity, to name a few. You will be evaluated on class participation and written assignments like discussion posts, an oral presentation, a paper, and a final project.

Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: None.  Class limit: 15.  Lab fee: None.  Meets the following degree requirements: HS",
HS2121,S28,"Donovan, Martha","Writing as Art, Craft, and Social Change",,I/M,"We write to discover what awes us, what questions we most need to ask, what conversations we hope to join, what causes we are drawn to support, what convictions we want to voice, and what ways we can write the world anew. Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.

We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. 

Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.

Classwork will include various analytical, generative, and collaborative exercises designed to help with matters of language, craft, technique, and rhetorical awareness. Students will write for a public audience and participate in active engagement with each other’s work.

Authors (representing a range of genres and topics) will likely include Annie Dillard, Rachel Carson, Barry Lopez, David Whyte, Margaret Renkl, Toni Morrison, Martin Luther King Jr., Terry Tempest Williams, and others. Students will also select a longer text to read from a list of authors that may include Jonathan Safran Foer, Susan Cain, Felicia Rose Chavez, Claudia Rankine, and others.

Students will be evaluated on class participation, written assignments, writing process, and presentations.

ES1054,S28,"Letcher, Susan",Biology: Form and Function,,I,"This is one half of a 20-week, two-term introductory course in biology, providing an overview of the discipline and prerequisite for many intermediate and advanced biology courses. The course will emphasize biological structures at the level of whole organisms and organs and their role in the survival and reproduction of individuals and the evolution of populations . We will explore principles of evolution, classification, anatomy and physiology, epidemiology, behavior, and basic ecology. The primary focus of the course is on vertebrate animals and vascular plants, but we will make forays into other phylogenetic lineages at intervals. Weekly field and laboratory studies introduce students to the local range of habitats and a broad array of protists, plants, and animals. Attendance at two lectures and one lab each week is required; course evaluation is based on class participation, exams, preparation of a lab/field notebook, and a presentation. It should be stressed that this course emphasizes the unity of the organism within its environment. Ideally students will subsequently enroll in Biology:Cells and Molecules in order to further their exploration of issues in a more reductionist form, but neither course is a pre-requisite for the other. 

Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None. Binoculars and a good pair of walking boots strongly advised. Class Limit: None. Lab Fee: $40. Meets the following degree requirements: ES.",
ES3090,S28,"Gibson, David",Practicum in Sustainable Energy,,M,"This is a hands-on, project-based class in which students will collaboratively plan for and participate in all aspects of renewable energy projects on College of the Atlantic's campus.  Examples of projects include installation of a solar photovoltaic array, airsealing and insulating one of the college's buildings, or planning and installing a greenhouse heating system. Students will learn how to take a project from design through fruition while navigating the various phases of the project lifecycle including operation and maintenance. The course will begin with an overview of existing technology and an analysis of the current energy generation and consumption data for the project site(s). The class will then plan the project and present this plan to the community. As part of this planning process, students will learn about the economics of renewable energy systems, including return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), and related quantities. Students who successfully complete this class will gain the skills necessary to conceptualize, plan for, finance, and implement renewable energy projects.  Evaluation will be based on several short presentations, problem sets, and active and effective participation in all aspects of the project. Default grade is Credit/No Credit.

Level: Intermediate. Pre-requisites: Physics and Mathematics of Sustainable Energy is strongly recommended.  Class limit: 10. Lab Fee: $50 Meets the following degree requirements: none.",

AD1071,S28,"Sebastian, Neeraj",Fundamentals of Painting,,I,"In this course, students will be introduced to the basic aspects involved in the process of translating what they are observing in space onto two-dimensional surfaces in oil paint. Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.

Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended. Evaluation will be based on how the specific criteria set for each assignment are met, participation and engagement during critiques, and receptivity to feedback.

Level: Introductory. Prerequisite: None, but previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended. Class limit: 12. Lab fee: $120. Meets the following degree requirements: ADS.",

HS2120,S28,"Van Vliet, Netta",Marx and Marxism,,I/M,"This course is an introduction to the work of Karl Marx and to some of the ways his work has been taken up across a range of disciplines, interdisciplinary fields, and political projects. We will pay particular attention to his thinking about the relation between theory and praxis, and to his notions of capital, value, money, commodity, labour, ideology, alienation, internationalism and class struggle. In addition to reading Marx’s own writings, we will also read work in postcolonial studies, feminist theory, cultural anthropology, racial capitalism, Black Studies and philosophy that engages with Marx’s thinking. In addition to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, authors will likely include Louis Althusser, Charisse Burden-Stelly, Frantz Fanon, Silvia Federici, Antonio Gramsci, David Harvey, C.L.R. James, Ranjana Khanna, Rosa Luxemburg, Catherine MacKinnon, Adam Smith, and Gayatri Spivak. We will examine the implications of Marxist analyses for questions of political and structural change, critiques of capitalism and analyses of its relation to racialised and gendered dynamics of power. In addition to academic texts, course materials will draw on films, news publications, and contemporary examples of political-economic challenges. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, weekly reading responses, collaborative small group and individual projects.

Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: None.  Class limit: 15.  Lab fee: None.  Meets the following degree requirements: HS.",
