We call her weasel, because, well, she kinda looks like a weasel.
Weasel is quite skitterish; she spends a lot of time under the bed 
and behind the bathtub.  She used to be afraid of the ceiling fans, although
she's more or less gotten used to them by now.  It's an uneasy truce.
Weasel is rarely seen by visitors. <p>
