<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
We develop information-theoretic measures of spatial structure and
pattern in more than one dimension. As is well known, the entropy
density of a two-dimensional configuration can be efficiently and
accurately estimated via a converging sequence of conditional
entropies.  We show that the manner in which these conditional
entropies converge to their asymptotic value serves as a measure of
global correlation and structure for spatial systems in any
dimension. We compare and contrast entropy-convergence with
mutual-information and structure-factor techniques for quantifying and
detecting spatial structure.
