<b> Engineering Honor Society</b> The engineering honor society (which
has a set of three Greek letters associated with it, but I can't remember 
them) provides free tutoring in math and physics on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
from 3:00 to 6:00 in the basement of the Physical Sciences Library.  I'm
only 95% sure I've got the times right.  If somebody could confirm this,
I'd appreciate it.<p>
