<h2> Comments on the First Midterm </h2>
</center>
<br>
A sample midterm will be available at Navin's Wednesday afternoon.<p>
<b> Logistics:</b>
<ul>

<li>  The exam is in Roessler 66, (where we usually have class).
<li>  You do not need to bring blue books
<li>  The exam is closed book; closed notes.
<li>  The exam is 50 minutes long.  There are approximately six problems.
<li>  The problems have unequal point value.  Pay attention to this
	and use your time wisely.
<li>  On most problems, in order to receive full credit, you must show
	your work.  (If no work is shown you will surely receive no
	partial credit!!)  
<li>  We will not provide equations on the exam, so you should be sure to know
	the basic kinematics equations, Newton's laws, etc.

</ul>


<b> What the exam will cover:</b>
<ul>
<li>  All of chapters 1, 2 and 3.  Chapter 4, up to and including section 4-4.
<li>  The exam will <b> NOT </b> cover the normal force.
<li>  There is no need to memorize conversion factors.

<li> Your study time would be best spent going over homework problems, 
discussion section problems, supplementary problems, and topics discussed
in lecture.  

</ul>
