<br><HR><P>


<B> (4/23) </b> <ul>
<li>  I'm about to drop off Week IV supplemental problems and Midterm
Solutions.  They will be at Navin's around 2:15.  The Midterm solutions
are a little terse in some places.  If you don't understand the solutions
and/or why you lost points, be sure to ask someone!
</ul>
<HR><P>


<B> (4/21) </b> <ul>
<li>  Midterms are graded!  We will hand them back at the beginning of
class on Monday.  The scores are also posted in the glass case in the
East Wing of the first floor of the physics building.  You should be sure
to check the score here, to make sure we entered it into the computer
correctly. <p>
<li>  All requests for regrades must be done in writing.  Attach a note
to the exam explaining why you feel an injustice was done.  (Do not write
on the exam!)  It is quite likely that some errors were made during 
grading --- there were only three of us grading almost 1200 problems.  If
you think we goofed, please let us know.<p>
<li>  Solutions to the exam will be available at Navin's soon.  I'll also
post exam solutions in the glass case.
</ul>
<HR><P>


<B> (4/20) </b> <ul>

you can't find a computer that will run netscape (or mosaic.)
