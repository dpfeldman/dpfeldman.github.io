<h3> How to access the  Physics 9A Web Page, (or <i>any </i>web page)
without Using Netscape </h3>
</center>
<HR><p>

Netscape, and other graphical web browsers such as Mosaic, can't run
on all computers because they use graphics that not all computers or
terminals can handle.  There exist text-only browsers that can run on
almost any terminal.  The one I'm familiar with is called <b> lynx</b>.
Lynx is installed on the machines accessible with your ez account.  Unlike
Netscape, lynx doesn't need X windows to run.  <p>

I mention this because perhaps some of you have difficulty getting access
to Netscape, or the like.  (Perhaps you can't "slip" in from your
home computer to access the web, or the only terminal you can find is one
of those green things from the early eighties.)  With lynx, you 
can still access the
web.  The pretty graphics won't be there, but the text will.  This should
certainly be sufficient if you want to check the 9A web site for an 
assignment or something.<p>

So, here's how you do it.  At your "$" prompt, type: lynx (URL of the 
Web Site you with to go to)  .  For example, if you wanted to go to the
physics 9A web site, you would type:  
lynx ftp://landau.ucdavis.edu/pub/feldman/9A/phy9A.html. <p>
You can also just type lynx, and then once in lynx use
the "go" command.  There's a menu of options at the bottom of the screen,
including an option to receive help.  You can make bookmarks and save documents
in lynx just like you can in netscape (or whatever.)  If you can figure out
how to use netscape, I'm sure you can figure out how to use lynx.

There's also a man page for lynx, for those of you who are into such things.
Type "man lynx" and information about lynx will appear on your screen.

Hopefully this will be of use to someone.  (Probably most of you are far
more computer literate than me.)  If what I've suggested doesn't work, or
is incorrect, or could be stated better, please let me know.
