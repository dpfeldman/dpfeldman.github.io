<ul>
<li><b> Site of the Week:</b> 
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pemayer/ScienceJokes.html"> 
Science Jokes Archive </a>.  As the
name suggests, lots and lots of science jokes are kept here.  Most are 
kinda stupid, but a few are pretty amusing.<p>



<li> Previous sites of the week:<ul>
<li>If you have <a href="http://v2hfzr.msae.wisc.edu/drflux/index.html">
questions about superconductivity </a> you can ask them here.<p>

<li> Next week (as of April 20 or something) is math awareness week!  The math department has a page
listing <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~gehrmann/dept/mathweek.html"> 
a few talks </a>
that will be occurring on campus.  Some of these talks look pretty good; I'm
going to go to a few if I have time.
<p>
<li> Some comments on <a href="http://godel.ph.utexas.edu/Members/larry/Phy306/DoingPhysics/DoingPhysics.html"> How to study physics
</a> from  <a href="http://godel.ph.utexas.edu:80/Members/larry/oldwelcome.html"> Larry Sheply </a>  at the University of Texas, Austin.  I think this is
a little dorky, but the stuff on problem solving down at the end of this
rather long document looks good.
<p>
<li><a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~dmason/probs/probm.html">
Some physics problems from Oregon</a>.  This site has a collection of
physics problems (with hints and solutions!) at a level appropriate to this
class.  I'm not sure how useful these are.  My gut feeling is that your time
would be better spent with pencil and paper doing problems the old fashioned
way.  However, these pages may be of interest to some.  If you find these
useful, let me know. <p>
</ul>

<li><b> Site of the Week:</b>
If you want to <a href="http://www.eclipse.net/derek/html.html"> 
learn how to make your own web pages</a>, here's
a good place to start looking for info.  (It's surprisingly easy.)
<p>


<li> Previous sites of the week:<ul>

<li>The <a href="http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~dpd/"> Davis Police Department </a> is online.  Who would have thunk it?
This site has some
good info on it, and is a little goofy, in a reassuring sort of way.
<p>
<li>
<a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/"> Dilbert!</a>
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.usfca.edu/usf/neufeld/concerts.html">
Concerts in the Bay Area</a>.  This site, updated weekly, has listings for
all sorts of bay area shows.  Quite thorough.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/Webweather/ww?city=sac">
Local Weather</a>.  You can get local weather information, and even radar
and satellite photos here.<p>
