<h2> Comments on the Second Midterm </h2>
</center>
<br>
We will not make a sample midterm this time.  The overall style of the second
midterm will be very similar to the first.<p>

<b> Logistics:</b>
<ul>

<li>  The exam is in Roessler 66, (where we usually have class).
<li>  You do not need to bring blue books
<li>  The exam is closed book; closed notes.
<li>  The exam is 50 minutes long.  There are approximately seven problems.
<li>  The problems have unequal point value.  Pay attention to this
	and use your time wisely.
</ul>


<h3> An important warning: </h3><p>

There are many special-case formulas derived in chapter 5,6,7.  DO NOT
MEMORIZE THESE.  You should be familiar with newton's laws, work, friction
potential energy, conservation of energy and momentum.  Don't memorize
equations for particular problems.  If you use such an equation on an
exam, you will not get full credit for the problem unless you derive
the equation you've memorized. <p>

Any equation that we've discussed in class is fine to use.  An equation like
7-36 would surely need justification.<p>

<br>
<b> What the exam will cover:</b>
<ul>
<li> 
The exam will emphasize the topics we've discussed in class since the
first midterm.  This is roughly chapters 5,6,7, except as noted
below.<p>
<li>  The exam will <b> not </b> cover torque and rotational kinematics.<p>
<li>  The exam will <b> not </b> cover the following sections: <ul>

	<li> 5-4
	<li> 5-5
	<li> 6-9 
	<li> 7-8
	<li> 7-9
</ul><p>

<li> The exam will <b> not </b> cover the following topics: <ul>

	<li>Integrating to determine the center of mass of an extended object.
	<li>Changing reference frames to analyze collisions.
	<li>Impulse
	<li>Coefficient of Restitution
</ul>

</ul>

<b> Good luck!</b><p>
