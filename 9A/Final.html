<h2> Comments on the Final </h2>
</center>
<br>
We will not make a sample final.  The overall style of the final will be 
very similar to the midterms.<p>

<h3> Logistics </h3>
<ul>
<li>  The exam is  Wednesday, June 12, 8:00--10:00 am
	in Roessler 66. 
<li>  You do not need to bring blue books. 
<li>  The exam is closed book; closed notes. 
<li>  The exam is 2 hours long. There are approximately thirteen problems. 
<li>  The problems have unequal point value. Pay attention to this 
	and use your time wisely. 
</ul>

<h3> What the exam will cover </h3>

The final will be comprehensive, but will emphasize the material covered 
since the last midterm.  Roughly 2/3 of the final will be on material
that we've covered since the second midterm.  <p>


The following sections will not be on the exam: <ul>

<li>ch 8 sections 4,7,8,9
<li>ch 9 sections 4,5
<li>ch 10 sections 1,3,5,6,7
<li>ch 12 section 5
</ul>
Sections 7,8 of ch 12 (damped and forced oscillators) will be on the exam
only in the form of qualitative questions.  You will not need to know the
detailed equations. <p>

Topics not covered on <a href="MT.1.html"> Midterm I </a> or
 <a href="MT.2.html"> Midterm II </a> will, of course, not be covered
on the exam.<p>

If you use an equation other than those which we have discussed and/or
derived in class, you must provide a derivation or justification to
receive full credit.<p>
