Discussion attendence is 5% of your grade.  You may attend any section.  
Discussion sections emphasize group problem
solving; no quizzes or homework will be assigned.  <p>

<h3> Grading</h3><p>
<pre>
	Homework 	 20 %
	Midterms 	 40 %
	Final 		 35 %

Homework will be collected Friday at the beginning of class. 
Put your name and ID number on your
homework, and clearly label each problem. One problem will be 
randomly selected for thorough grading,
and the others will checked as either done or not done. 
You must show all work and box the 
answers to receive full credit.  No late homework will be accepted.<p>


The lab is not part of your lecture grade, but
you must pass the lab in order to pass this course.<p>

All exams are <i>closed</i> book.  Calculators are allowed. 
Make-up exams will be given only in the case of emergencies.  If you are ill, 
please obtain written documentation. No credit will be given
on homework and exams without all work 
being shown. If you believe there has been an error
in the grading of a homework problem
or exam, please write a clear note and resubmit to us.
This  must be done within one week of the return of
the graded material. <p>

A significant fraction of exam problems will be chosen from 
homework, discussion sections, and
lecture material.  Regular review of these parts of the 
course throughout the quarter will prepare
you well for the midterms and finals.  We will provide a more
detailed discussion of the topics to be covered and the overall style
of the exams in the near future.<p>

<HR><P>
<h3> Topics Covered </h3>

We will cover Chapters 1--10,12 in Tipler.<ul>
<li>Kinematics in 1,2, and 3 dimensions (Ch 2--3)
<li>Linear Dynamics- Newton's Laws, Force (Ch 4--5)
<li>Work, Energy, and Momentum (Ch 6--7)
<li>Rotational Dynamics, Torque, and Angular Momentum (Ch 8--9)
<li>Gravity (Ch 10)
<li>Oscillations (Ch 12)
</ul>

<HR><P>
<h3>Solutions  </h3>

Solutions to assigned problem sets will be available (after they
are due!) at Navin's.<p>

Each week, we will also provide some supplemental problems with solutions.
These also can be obtained at Navin's.  The purpose of these problems
is to give you some extra worked examples to look at when doing homework
and also to go into some topics in greater depth than we have time for 
during lectures. <p>
