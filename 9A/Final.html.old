<h2> Comments on the Final </h2>
</center>
<br>
We will not make a sample final.  The overall style of the final will be 
very similar to the midterms.<p>

The final will be comprehensive, but will emphasize the material covered 
since the last midterm.<p>

More details will appear here towards the end of the last week of classes.<p>
