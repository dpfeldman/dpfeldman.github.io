<h2> What this page is NOT for </h2>

The ``Information Superhiway'' (which you are on right now), is <b> not </b>
a substitute for human interaction.  Learning physics, or anything 
for that matter,
is a personal, human endeavor.  Computers are neat, but they are neither 
personal nor human.  If you have a question about course material, ask your
classmates, ask me, Dr. Scalettar, Phil, Leif, your Lab TA, <i> somebody</i>!  
By no means is this web page intended
to replace things like office hours! <p>


<blockquote>
There are good things about [the Internet], but there are also aspects of 
it that concern and worry me. This is an intuitive response -- I can't 
prove it -- but my feeling is that, since people aren't Martians or 
robots, direct face-to-face contact is an extremely important part of 
human life. It helps develop self-understanding and the growth of a 
healthy personality. <p>

You just have a different relationship to somebody when you're 
looking at them than you do when you're punching away at a keyboard and 
some symbols come back. I suspect that extending that form of abstract 
and remote relationship, instead of direct, personal contact, is going to 
have unpleasant effects on what people are like. It will diminish their 
humanity, I think. <p>
