<h1>Technology Posse Minutes</h1>
<h2>19 May 1999</h2>
<p>

Present: Dave, Anselm, Darlene, Travis, Anne, Trisha.<p>

Brief optical update:
<ul><li>	Fran contacted Bausch & Lomb; faculty have the opportunity to
	write 2-paragraph descriptions of need before term's end if
	they want additional optical equipment (microscopes,
	binoculars). 

	<li>should existing binocs be kept in the library for better
	accessibility by persons without a key to the biology
	equipment closet? <p>

</ul>

<b>Our Committee:</b> options for the Technology Posse's future
include:
<ul>
    <li>disbanding next year if we continue to be a task force (which
	is defined as a short-term group to solve a specific
	problem). 
     <li> becoming a standing committee to ACM.
     <li> becoming a subcommittee of Academic Affairs
     <ul><li> we would still be closely tied to academics, not held separately
		<li>easier than becoming our own committee
	<li>Concerns:  <ul><li>What about consequences of limiting our
	scope to academics?  
		<li>	but, just about everything we have done or will do
	has academic implications) 
			<li>Our goal of helping campus with long-range
	technological planning shouldn't change if we modify our
	committee standing.<p> 

</ul></ul></ul>

	Dave will consult with Academic Affairs and Steve Katona as to
	the feasibility of becoming an AA subcommittee.<p>

<b>Creative Multimedia Lab Proposal</b><p>

The Culpeper Foundation has invited the College to apply for a $200K
grant. A workgroup has been formed to decide how to craft the
proposal. Present members are Judy Allen, Karen Waldron, Doug Barkey,
Isabel Mancinelli, John Cooper, Steve Ressel, and Dave Feldman (it's
an open workgroup and students are invited; they meet Thursday's at
1:00.) The workgroup was announced at ACM this week. They should  have
the proposal written for the Foundation's approximate August board
meeting. <p>  

<ul>
<li>Workgroup's goals:     
<ul>	<li>Address raised questions from staff and faculty
	<li> request mult-phased funding
	<li> minimize additional carrying-costs (from new equipment or
	personnel requirements) during first phase. 
	<li> use first phase funding to fill holes in AV equipment,
	refresh design studios, update other campus equipment 
</ul>
<li> Needs should be addressed in an interdisciplinary manner
<ul><li> a concern is that we should better what we do now before we
go into new technological territory. </ul>

<li> Carrying-cost assessments should be performed at each project
phase for community discussion, to compare equality of technological
programs around campus. 

<li>Concerns:
<ul> <li> Will decisions be cost effective?
		<ul><li>buy satellite access vs. renting</ul>
	<li> Will new equipment be used (is there a great enough need)?
		<ul><li> foreign video machines
		<li> slide collection growth
		<li> who else could benefit?</ul>
	<li> Should part-time employees be hired on grant funds to
	carry out short-term tasks like organizing the slide
	collection or managing AV equipment? 
	<li> Will Anne, Judy, and Pam be continuously informed /
	consulted on technological issues? 

</ul>
