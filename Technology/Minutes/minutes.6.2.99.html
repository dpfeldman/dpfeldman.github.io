services position.

system bugs. 
</ul><p>

<b>Loose ends and things to work on over the summer and next fall</b>:

<ul>
<li>Modems - we should think of some possible scenarios over the
summer in order to identify what our options are. A decision can be
made next term. <p>

<li>How can we streamline Computer Services with 4 staff members?
<ul>	<li> Make the duties of individuals more well-known to community members
	<li>Give faculty assistance
	<li> Make office more visible
</ul><p>

<li>General Budgeting issues:
<ul>	
  <li> Why doesn't the College have a priority for finance
    expenditures?  
  <li>Should the Posse recommend a structure for budget use next term? 
  <li> Resource areas should at least have a knowledge of how the
  budget works and is used now.  
  <li>Encourage a larger capital equipment budget.
</ul><p>

<li>As an end note, we should probably take a step back next term and
review our mission in order to focus next year's projects. 

</ul>
