<h1>Technology Posse Minutes</h1>
<h2>7 April 1999</h2>
<p>

Present: Anselm, Judy, Darlene, Todd, Dave, Travis, Tricia, Gray,
Doug, and Sean. <p>

<b>Faculty Meeting discussion</b><p>

Brainstorming ideas of what to talk about:
<ul>
	<li> define how budget gets spent?
	<li> describe 3-year rotation?
	<li>descuss new computer room needs (or need of a new computer room)?
</ul><p>

Organization of technology discussion with faculty:
<ul>
	<li>Use the first half of next faculty meeting to get information like:
		<ul><li> what do faculty members use now in the way of
	technology in the
	classroom? 
	    <li> what do faculty members need to make their jobs better?
		<li>do they see a large difference between students
	concerning technological knowledge/use? 
		<li> How do they want to serve student needs? Focus on
	those with minimal
	technological knowledge (by creating a
			non-dedicated computer/ 
			teaching space) or increase ability of highly
			skilled students? 
		<li> What would they like to do with a class, assuming
			they're limited by the
			present level of classroom technology? 
</ul></ul><p>


When asking these questions, we need some way of organizing the
comments and seeing how they rank when compared to eachother; writing
on a tablet and having individuals put stickers next to ones they like
was one suggestion. 
Faculty will need time for the "digestion" of ideas, and we should
allow for (and encourage?) inter- and intra-resource area discussion. <p>


Concerning the 4th computer services position, we should ask what else
could be done with the extra person? <p>

IMPORTANT!!  Call a meeting for staff as well as faculty concerning
these technological issues. Treat them as importantly as faculty are
-- see their needs, address traditional inequalities between faculty 
and staff. <p>
<br>

<b>New computer services postion</b>
<ul>
   <li>We need a title...
   <li>Discussed the position's duties and order of importance;
   streamlined experience requirements.
   <ul> <li>We need Mac expertise and familiarity with Windows
   platform 
<li>Reinforce the postion's activity with facutly, staff, and students 
<li>Give edited description, wi th our recommendation for print, to
   Senior Staff (?) and Personnel Committee. 
</ul></ul><p>


<b>Modems -- Panex</b>
<ul>
<li>Our goal: dial-in availability without needing to worry about it
	<ul><li>have a company use our lines with their upgraded equipment,
	their support services.
</ul></ul>
