<h1>Technology Posse Minutes</h1>
<h2>28 April 1999</h2>
<p>



Members present: Dave, Anselm, Doug, Darlene, Trisha, Travis, Pam,
Todd, and Sean.<p>
<br>

<b>Our relation to standing committees:</b>
<ul><li>	Best to draw a charter after we've been functional for
a year (at the end of this term).
</ul>


<b>GroupWise: What happened?</b>
<ul>
<li>	Large files thought to have blocked the gateway; suggestion
	made to re-write the College's network policy by
	this Fall term to prevent future occurrences. 
<li> What about the need for an open policy? Too tight a restriction
	may prevent both students and faculty from undertaking unique
	projects. 
<li> Compare our potential need for rewriting policy to other
	institution policies like other schools, JAX... 
<li> We'd need more definite diagnostics to find out what really
	happened in order to prevent future problems through policy
	revision. 
<li> Message size restriction quotas vs. system expansion as two
	extreme potential solutions. 
</ul>

<b>Communication around campus: unreliable email...</b>
<ul>
<li>Should we make email use a part of new-student orientation? At
least raise awareness, possibly through Core Coarse. 
<li>Too directive to say "Check email." Better to say that "community
business will most often be done via email, if you don't check email
you'll miss out on functions and deadlines." 
<li> Assure network reliability if we depend on email system. 
</ul>
<p>

<b>"4th computer position":</b>
<ul>
<li>New position has been advertised (by email) in-house, to be
	put in papers/website/usenet newsgroups on Thursday, the
	29th. 
<li> Have serious applicants meet faculty / staff since they'll be
	working together. 
<li> There seems to be confusion as to why the position is needed,
	even though most people knew about it earlier this month. 
</ul>


<b>Faculty meeting results:</b>
<ul>
<li>Give faculty access to results (give them web address of
spreadsheet). 
<li>Follow through with survey by assessing feasibility of requests,
determine what we're going to do next. 
</ul>
<p>

No meeting next week, May 5th.
