<h1>Technology Posse Minutes</h1>
<h2>12 May 1999</h2>
<p>

Present:  Anne Swann, Dave, Doug, Anselm, Todd, Darlene, Judy, Trisha,
Travis, Sean<p> 

<b>Updates:</b><p><ul>
    <li>Phones: system is being installed, most faculty/staff will
	get new phones. Pam's real busy! 
    <li>Modem: We now have a deadline for our decision on what to do
    for dial-up service: our modem board is NOT Y2K
    compliant. Maintaining our own dial-in, with own modem, isn't
    feasible. 
    <li>Hire: 3 out of 11 applicants already recieved could possibly
    fill the position. Our description was sent to major regional
    universities and is scheduled for the Bangor Daily next
    weekend. We will only adverise in Boston if we find that more
    applicants are needed; this avoids long-distance ads, which bring
    applicants looking for high-salary positions (few may want to move
    to Maine, as another downside).  There is no set deadline for
    hiring, but the position can open as soon as July 1 with the start
    of the new financial year. <p><br>

</ul>

<b>Faculty Survey:</b><ul>
    <li>Our goal: What are we going to come up with as a result of the
    survey? 
    <li>A plan to get all classrooms to a basic level of technology,
    method of long-term planning.  
    <li>Process: look at what people want, discuss ways to address the
    needs, come up with a plan of action. 
</ul><p><br>


Most common request: <b>Outfit classrooms with AV equipment.</b>
We asked ourselves "what SHOULD be in classrooms?"
<ol><li> Good chalkboards
	<li> overhead projector & screen
	<li> TV/VCR
	<li> slide projector, darkenability, good lighting, computers
	for presentations, LCD units for projecting computer screen,
	in-wall thin screen for direct computer connection/TV. 
</ol><p>

Comments:
<ul>
	<li>Educate everyone as to what's already available
	(projectors, TVs can be signed out of the library) 
	<li>Organize a list of current classrooms and the equipment
	they already have  
	<li> Should we dedicate specific equipment to certain areas of
	campus? (microscope cameras in botany & bio labs, opaque
	projector in art studios...) 
	<li>The need of a directed budget: list what is still needed
	for classroom technologies, find their costs, and plan
	purchases (this is the long-term equipment plan that faculty
	voted for) 
 
	<li>Review our "charter" for deciding what we want to do next,
	concerning our Posse making suggestions to the money spenders
	on campus 
	<li>Get detailed suggestions from the greater community so we
	do this right. 
	<li>Anne was asked to give us a list of AV equipment currently
	in each classroom. 
</ul>
