This list summarizes the activities of the president's task force on
strategic technology and communications planning.  This list is not
prioritized; i.e., item 1 is not necessarily more important than item
2.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><B>Assessment of Short-Term Communications Technology Needs
of the Faculty:</B>  Early in the Spring term of 1999, we conducted a
brief discussion 
and survey of faculty's technology needs.  Specifically, we asked what
technology faculty needed to help them teach better.  This discussion
was brief, and focused on short term needs.  It was not, by any
means, a  comprehensive review of technology needs.  The following
items received more than one vote.  The numbers in parentheses
indicated the number of votes an item received.

<P>
<DT>2.
<DD><B>Responses to perceived needs of the faculty:</B>

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Items (a), (c), (d) and (e) have been summarized and submitted
in a separate memo for consideration for title III or other granting
opportunities.  

<P>
<LI>Prior to the creation of the technology task force, it had been
decided to hire an additional staff person for computer services.
This addresses item (b).

<P>
<LI>Item (f) has been addressed by the most recent wave of
computer upgrades. 

<P>
<LI>Our response to item (g) is discussed in item 3, below.

<P>
<LI>The question of modems and dial-up access was a frequent topic
of discussion during the year-long existence of the task force.  The
faculty as a whole has repeatedly said that dial-up access from home
is a high priority.  The task force has not been able to come to
consensus on how to proceed.  

<P>
<LI>Item (i) has been addressed by the international studies
committee.   

<P>
</UL>

<P>
<DT>3.
<DD><B>Equipment Acquisition Proposal:</B> In our brief discussion
in the faculty meeting and elsewhere, 
we frequently heard a desire for a long-term equipment plan.  In
response to this, we have drafted a proposal for a procedure through
which faculty can purchase equipment.  This proposal has approved
unanimously by our task force and has recently been  submitted to
Jonathan Ehrlich and the Academic Affairs Committee.

<P>
<DT>4.
<DD><B>Recommendation that academic affairs facilitate a
discussion of the future directions of academic and educational
computing at COA:</B>  We were never able to undertake an assessment of
longer-term educational technology needs; in this sense one of the
main goals of our task force has not been achieved.  In our discussion
with faculty, we gained the sense that there were some basic needs
that weren't being met.  There was some division within our group
about whether or not it was appropriate to proceed with a long-term
assessment of technology goals without also simultaneously addressing
some of these shorter term concerns.  At this point, however, we
believe that many of these short-term needs have been addressed.  We
strongly encourage the Academic Affairs Committee to facilitate a
broad discussion of how technology should and should not be used to
further the educational mission of the college.  

<P>
<DT>5.
<DD><B>Recognition of the ongoing need to facilitate, chart,
budget for, and manage of technology across the campus:</B>  In
addition to the above item concerning educational and 
academic technology, there is an important, ongoing need to establish a
clear process for the articulation and communication of technology
priorities.  It is the general sense of the task force that some sort
of regular group needs to be established to chart and help manage and
plan for the ongoing, cross campus uses of technology by students,
staff, and faculty.  However, the working group was not unified in its
sense of how best to do this. 

<P>
<DT>6.
<DD><B>Recommendation that a group of faculty, staff, and students
be convened to explore the possibility of a computer classroom on
campus:</B> It is our strong sense that a computer classroom would greatly
extend and improve the ways we use technology to help us teach and
learn.  By computer classroom, we have in mind a multi-use teaching
space designed specifically to incorporate computers.  A wide range
of faculty, staff, and students have expressed interest in such a
facility.  A computer classroom will have a broad curricular impact and
will be used by a large percentage of students.  Perhaps most
importantly, a computer classroom will let us explore technology in
ways that we haven't been able to do previously.  Thus, we feel that a
computer classroom is a logical next step for the college.  We
recommend the formation of a group of interested faculty, staff, and
students to further clarify what we want and then work with the
director of development, the academic affairs committee, and the
academic dean to figure out how meet our goals.

<P>
<DT>7.
<DD><B>Recommendation that the physical condition of classrooms be
monitored:</B> During our many discussions of technology, a strongly recurring
theme among faculty was the need for adequately equipped classrooms.
In addition to ``high tech'' items like overhead projectors and vcrs,
there seemed to be significant concern about such things as
blackboards, chalk, and lighting.  We encourage the academic affairs
committee to be vigilant in making sure that our teaching spaces are
appropriately maintained and supported.
