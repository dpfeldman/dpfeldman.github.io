<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 25 January</b><p> Please hand in all work
on separate paper -- please don't hand in your work on the photocopied
worksheets.<p> 

<b>Very Important Note:</b>  The lesson numbers below all refer to the
new set of handouts -- not those from the last homework assignment!!!<p>
<br>



<b>Project</b>
<ol>
<li> Write a paragraph or so giving me some sense of your thoughts
about possible topics for final projects.  This isn't a binding
proposal.  The idea is for you to start thinking about topics, and for
me to get an idea of people's thoughts so maybe I can make some
suggestions.  
</ol>


<b>Lesson 5:  Nonlinear Iteration</b>
<ol>
<li>1
<li>2 (feel free to use the program on my web page and/or a graphing
calculator to help you.)
<li>4
<li>5
<li>9. (<b>optional</b>.  This one is a little more challenging than
the others.)
</ol>
