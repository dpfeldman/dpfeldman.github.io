<b>Homework 6:  Due Friday 8 February</b><p> Please hand in all work
on separate paper -- please don't hand in your work on the photocopied
worksheets.<p> 

<b>Computer Exercises</b><p>
For these problems you'll want to use the three computer programs
located at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos</a>.
<p>

For each r value, do the following.
<ol> 
<li>Determine the long-term behavior of the orbits.  Are the orbits
periodic (what period?) or chaotic?
<li>Does the equation show the butterfly effect?  
</ol>
Sketch or print out any graphs you use to draw your conclusions.


<ol>
<li>3.4
<li>3.7
<li>3.835
<li>3.5699456718695445 (don't round off). 
</ol>






<p>
<b>Lesson 7: The Butterfly Effect </b> (I haven't given you this sheet
yet.  I'll bring them to class, and also put a pile outside my door in
case you want one before Thursday.
<ol>
<li>2. 
</ol>
<p>
<b>Lesson 2:  Fractals Generated by Removals</b>
<ol>
<li>1-4. Also, find the dimension for each object.
</ol>


<b>Lesson 3: Self-Similarity</b>
<ol>
<li>1-5.  Also, find the dimension for each object.
</ol>

<b>Lesson 9: Fractal Dimension</b>
<ul>
<li>No problems from this section.  However, if you're confused about
this dimension stuff that we've been doing in class, you might want to
look at pp. 132-134; there's a nice explanation of dimension here.
</ul>
