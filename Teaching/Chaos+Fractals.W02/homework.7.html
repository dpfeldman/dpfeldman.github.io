<b>Homework 7:  Due Friday 22 February</b><p> Please hand in all work
on separate paper -- please don't hand in your work on the photocopied
worksheets.<p> 

<b>Estimating Feigenbaum's Number</b><p>
For this exercise, you'll want to use the three computer programs located at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos</a>.   
<p>


<ol> 
<li>Find the r values at which the first several period doubling
bifurcations occur.  Find the value up to at least the period 8 -
period 16 transition.  
<li>Use your results to estimate Feigenbaum's delta -- the ratio of
the lenghts of the pitchforks.  Delta is approximately 4.6692016. 
<li><i>Optional</i>:   Estimate Feibenbaum's alpha -- the ratio of
the widths of the pitchforks.  Alpha is approximately 2.503.
</ol>


<p>
<b>Lesson 2:  Complex Linear Iteration </b> Some of these might not be
easy. I strongly suggest you start early.
