<h3>Informal Description of the Course</h3><br>


<ol><li> I've taught this class twice before, in the winter of
    2003 and the spring of 2007. Both times the class went quite well
    and was a lot of fun. It was a large class (around 25 students)
    and taken by students with a wide range of interests. 

<li> We will cover just a handful of key ideas, but will do so from a
  number of different perspectives. Some parts of this class will be
  quite mathematical, others will be not mathematical at all. It is
  likely that you will enjoy some parts of the class more than
  others. I think that these different perspectives will be
  complementary. However, there might be a little bit of redundancy at
  times. 

<li> You do not need to have taken Physics I and II here (or anywhere)
  to take Physics III. 

<li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
  confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
  sooner rather than later. I can't offer assistance if I don't know
  who needs it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if
  you need it. On a related note ... 

<li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated&mdash;I strongly suggest
  working with others and seeking help if you need it. 

<!--<li> The exact syllabus for this class is quite flexible; feedback is
  encouraged, and will help make the class better. -->

<li> You should be aware that this course is quite different than
  Physics III courses at other colleges and universities. 

<li> You'll probably spend more time reading and thinking, and less
  time doing HW than you did in Physics I and/or II or Calculus. The
  last time I taught the class students reported that discussion with
  peers outside of class were particularly valuable. 

<li> The study of quantum mechanics has a very different feel to it
  than many other areas of physics. It's weird&mdash;far weirder than
  special relativity. My hope is that this will make you
  uncomfortable, but in a good way.  

<li>For students 
    who are more interested in the philosophical aspects of QM and
    less interested in the the mathematical theory, it should be
    possible to concentrate on this some independently towards the end
    of the course.  

</ol>


<h3>What this course is <b>not</b></h3><br>

<ul>

<li><b>A modern physics course.</b> Many first courses on quantum
  mechanics emphasize the tremendous 
  applications of quantum mechanics. This is understandable; QM can
  explain atomic spectra, the specific heat of solids,
  semi-conductors, molecular bonding, etc. Courses with this emphasis
  are often titled Modern Physics. Modern Physics is a standard
  sophomore/junior level course for physics and chemistry majors. This
  course is not a modern physics course. It instead considers in
  considerable detail a few very simple QM systems. The goal is to
  give insight into the structure of the theory of quantum mechanics
  and make clear those aspects of quantum mechanics that are different
  than classical mechanics. This course is not unique. A similar,
  although less technical, course has been offered for years at
  Oberlin college. A more advanced version of this course has been
  offered a few times at Oregon State University. We will be using
  materials from both of these courses. <br>

  <li><b>A philosophy course.</b> This course is designed to explain
    what's new and different and  
    strange and unsettling about quantum mechanics. In so doing, we
    will have considerable opportunity to discuss wave-particle
    duality, entanglement, causality, non-locality, and other spooky and/or
    philosophical things. However, this is not a philosophy course. 

<!--In
    addition to philosophy, we will read some about the history of
    quantum mechanics and the social conditions of the scientists who
    helped create the theory.-->  <br>

<li><b>A new-age quantum experience.</b> We will not directly cover
    such things as quantum healing, quantum 
    psychology, quantum consciousness, etc. Nevertheless, this course
    should put you in a position to examine these ideas critically,
    carefully, and thoughtfully. <br>

 <li><b>A particle physics course</b>. This is not a course about
 string theory or modern particle 
 physics. 
</ul>


<h3>Rough Outline</h3><br>


<ol>

<li> The first part of the course of the course we will use Dan
   Styer's book, the Strange World of Quantum Mechanics.  In the past,
   students have liked like this book but occasionally
   wondered if Styer was over-simplifying things.

<li> The second part of the course we will dig deeper into some of the
   philosophical questions raised by QM. In so doing we will read a
   handful of articles and book chapters that aren't from Styer. 

<li> For the third part, we will use parts of the short book by
  McIntyre. In so doing, we will revisit many of the topics covered by
  Styer, but in a much more mathematical way. Those of you who like
  math and abstraction will enjoy this. I think you will find,
  however, that the math doesn't help with the philosophical or
  conceptual questions raised by QM.  I suspect at this point that you 
  will appreciate Styer's book much more than you might have at
  first. 

<li> We will then look some at the historical development of
   QM. There will be two prongs to this. One will be scientific, the
   other historical and social. For the scientific prong, we'll use
   some materials from traditional modern physics texts. And for the
   historical, we'll read a few essays about some of the key
   scientists who developed QM.

<li>Finally, we will end the term with a discussion of cryptography and
   quantum cryptography.  This is a fun topic that seems to go well in
   the last few weeks of spring term.
