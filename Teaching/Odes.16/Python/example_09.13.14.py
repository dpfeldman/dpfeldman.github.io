# Lines that begin with a '#' are comments and are ignored when
# the program is run.  Use comments to make notes to yourself in
# your programs so that they're easier to understand.

# import math stuff
from math import *
# this tells python to import stuff from the math module

print("hello world")

# Let's experiment with variables and stuff
x = 7
y = 9
print(x+y)
z = y/x
print(z)


# Let's experiment with a few more math things
print("sin(2) = ",sin(2))
print("The logarithm of 2 is " , log(2))

# variables can be words
message = "Hello World"
print(message)


# some for loops
for i in range(7):
    print(i)
print()
