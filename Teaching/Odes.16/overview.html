<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Gain a solid introduction to differential equations: learn what
    differential equations are, be able to formulate original
    mathematical models using differential equations, and be able to
    use a variety of techniques to solve and understand differential
    questions, including numerical and qualitative methods.  
  <li> Gain experience conceptualizing, carrying out, and presenting
  research. This includes conceptualizing and framing research
  questions and problems, conducing a literature review, presenting
  results in a professional-style research talk, and writing up
  results in a style appropriate for publication.  
  <li> Gain experience with scientific computing and writing programs
  to help you carry out mathematical analysis. 
</ul><br>

<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>There is no textbook for this course.  We will use some online
  resources and I will distribute articles and perhaps some of my own
  notes. 
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>Your evaluation will be based roughly as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Homework assignments (25%)
  <li>Research project (70%)
  <li>Class participation (5%)
</ul>
</p>

<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 

<h3>Some Details</h3>
<p>
<ol>
   <li> Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the
   day. More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result
   in me mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result
   in a lowering of your grade. 

   <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
   can also consult me, other faculty, friends, and
   family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
   understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
   problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
   photocopy their solution and turn it in. 

   <li> You will need regular and reliable access to a computer that
   has python on it.  If you need a loaner laptop from the school,
   please let me know.

  <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
    important that you check your email. 

  <li>There will often be reading to do before class.  It is important
  that you do the reading and come ready to discuss and ask
  questions.  

<li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is subscribing
  to common standards of academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism,
  falsifying or fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A
  student must make it his or her responsibility to not use words or
  works of others without proper acknowledgment. 
Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence of such activity is reported
  to the academic dean or his/her designee. Two violations of academic
  integrity are grounds for dismissal from the college. Students
  should request in-class discussions of such questions when complex
  issues of ethical scholarship arise. 

</ol>
</p>

<h3>Other Thoughts about the Course</h3>
<p>
<ol>
   <li> I've taught this class four times before, and each time it's gone
   quite well. This year will be very similar to the version of the
   course I offered in 2014. So I'm pretty confident of how most
   things will go.  

  <li>This class is listed as an intermediate/advanced (I/A)
  class. It's not I/A because we'll be doing <i> super hard, super
  tricky</i> math. Rather, it's I/A because of what you'll be asked to
  do with some mostly straightforward math. You'll be asked to think
  with math and to use math creatively. You will also be expected to
  think about the structure of research and improve research skills. 

  <li>This class makes extensive use of ideas from calculus. It's
  important that you've had both differential and integral calculus
  before and felt reasonably good about the experience, although it's
  ok if you've forgotten much of it. 

  <li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
  confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
  sooner rather than later. 

  <li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
  time. The style of homework assignments in this class might be very
  different from what you're used to. Don't let yourself get
  frustrated.  I strongly suggest working with others and seeking help
  if you need it.  

  <li> There will be few, if any, quick plug-in assignments. This class
  is not so much about mathematical calisthenics. Rather, there will
  be only a few problems, but they will be longer, requiring multiple
  steps. On some occasions you will be asked to form your own
  mathematical model as part of a problem. 

  <li>You will learn some of the basic elements of the python programming
  language.  This is not a full course in python by any means; my goal
  is to teach you just enough so you can use it for what we need in
  this course, and also give you enough fundamentals so that you can
  learn further on your own if you want.  I'm confident that this will
  work well.

<li>This course is structured to allow you to do a significant project
  as part of the coursework. You will need  to start early on this and
  keep moving throughout the term. There will be numerous check-points
  throughout the term, including an oral presentation during week
  five. Falling behind in your project can be disastrous. 

<li> Throughout I will be taking a (hyper) "modern" approach to
     differential equations. I emphasize
     qualitative, global analysis of differential equations, rather
     than specialized analytic tricks.  We will frequently rely on
     numerical solutions to differential equations.
     We will use computers without guilt or
     apology to help us do mathematics and science.  All of this might
     give the course a different feel than other math classes you've
     taken.  

  <li> There are three parts to this course: differential equations,
  python, and research projects.  These strands will flow more or less
  in parallel.  I don't think this will be a problem, but it may be
  just a tiny bit schizophrenic at first.

<h3>Research Projects</h3>
<p class="no-box">
 <b>This class is designed to help you transition from being a reader,
 to being read, from being someone who listens, to someone who is
 listened to.</b>
<p>  
Research is an essential component of almost any area of study and
field of work. Learning what research is, how to think about it, and
how to do it well, are extremely important skills---ones that you will
use in many, many areas beyond differential equations and
mathematics. I think research skills are important enough that it is
worth devoting a considerable fraction of this class to them.  
<p> 
<b>Overview</b>: The research project should be an in-depth
exploration of a particular application of differential equations. It
may also be possible to do a more theoretical project. We will spend
the first few weeks of the term talking about what research is, how to
move from an area of interest to a topic, and how to relate a research
question to a broader set of questions or concerns. There are three
major "deliverables" associated with the project:
<ol>
  <li><b>Initial Presentation</b>: During week five you will give an
  initial presentation in which you introduce your topic. You should
  give a sense of what you'll be doing the next several weeks and the
  questions you'll wish to address. There are three reasons for this
  initial presentation. 
<ol>
    <li> It will force you to choose a topic early rather than later.
    <li> It will let other people in the class know what you're up to,
    so you can get feedback and ideas from others. 
    <li> It will give you a chance to practice giving technical
    presentations. You'll get feedback on your presentation from both
    me and classmates.  
</ol>

<li><b>Final Presentations</b>: Sometime during week 10 we will give
  presentations in a session open to the community. These talks will
  follow the format of contributed talks at a scientific meeting. 

<li><b>Paper or Technical Report</b>: Due on the last day of the
    term. This 
    will be a 5-20 page paper on your research question. You should
    write in a style appropriate for publication in peer-reviewed
    journal of your choosing. (If you want to explore another form,
    this is possible, but you should clear this with me early on.)
    Your paper must be well-formatted, include figures and graphs as
    appropriate, and correctly use the citation format standard for
    whichever journal you choose.  
</ol>

<p>Throughout the term we will spend time discussing a number of
  issues and ideas in research, and also cover some specific research
  skills. This will likely include: 
<ul>
  <li> The difference between interests, topics, questions, and problems
  <li> The mechanics of peer-reviewed journals and academic
  publishing
  <li> The rhetorical style of research papers
  <li> How to search for sources, including using the citation lists
    available in Google scholar
  <li>  How to give an effective technical presentation
  <li>  Ethics in research, plagiarism and academic fraud, issues
    surrounding research on human subjects
  <li>Software for organizing and automating bibliographies
</ul>

<p>I probably will also divide you up into small groups based on
    similarity of interests and ask your groups to meet and/or share
    resources.

<p>A few of these discussions may sound not that interesting, but give
  them a shot.  In the past students have found these topics to be
  useful and quite helpful.

<p>It is inevitable that some of you will "get farther" in your
  projects than others, since some of you are farther along in your
  studies.  Also, some research topics are harder to make progress on
  than others.  This diversity is fine.  The point of the projects
  is not to come up with publishable original research or even have
  an amazing and polished final result.  Rather, the idea is to strive
  toward as good a result as possible, and learn a lot (and challenge
  yourself and have fun) while doing so.

<p>Finally, as you may have guessed, I suspect that these research
  projects will be a lot of work. But with a good topic and the right
  attitude, I think this work can be very fun and rewarding. And I
  think doing a term-long project like this will be very helpful
  before undertaking your final project or a research internship
  somewhere.
