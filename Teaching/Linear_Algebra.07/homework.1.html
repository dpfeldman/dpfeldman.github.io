<b>Homework 1:  Due Friday 24 September</b><p>  
<br>


Problem 1 is based very closely on a problem from Daniel Kaplan and
Leon Glass, <i>Understanding Nonlinear dynamics</i>, Springer-Verlag,
1995.  This is an excellent text; I used it the first time I taught
this class.  If you want to learn more about chaos and nonlinear
dynamics, this is a great place to start.<p>


The first three problems should require very little algebra.  The last
problem will require a moderate amount of algebra.<p>


<ol>
<li>Find a function for a finite-difference equation with:
<ol>
<li>Four fixed points, all of which are unstable.  
<li>Eleven fixed points, three of which are stable.
<li>No fixed points.
</ol>
Hint: just give the function's graph.  Do no algebra!<p>


<li> Consider the function f(x) = x^3.  
<ol>
   <li>Plot the function.  Choose several different initial conditions
   and show their graphical iterates.
   <li>Based on your graphical work, find all fixed points and
   classify them.
   <li>Using the algebraic criteria (i.e. by finding the slope at the
   fixed points), determine the stability of all fixed points.
   <li>Does your algebra agree with the graphical results?<p>
</ol>

<li>Consider the function f(x) = -x + 4
<ol>
   <li>Plot the function. Choose several different initial conditions
   and show their graphical iterates.
   <li>Does this function have a fixed point?
   <li>What type of fixed point is it?  Discuss. <p>
</ol>


<!--
<li>The following equation plays a role in the analysis of nonlinear
models of gene and neural networks (Glass and Pasternack, Stable
oscillations in mathematical models of biological control systems,
<i>J. Math. Biol.</i> <b>6</b>, 207-23:1978.):<p>

x_{t+1} = (ax_t )/ (1 + bx_t),<p>

where a and b are positive numbers, and x_t is non-negative.
Algebraically determine the fixed points.  For each fixed point, give
the range of a and b for which it exists, indicate whether the fixed
point is stable or unstable, and state whether the dynamics in the
neighborhood of the fixed point are monotonic or oscillatory.  <p>

<li>The population of a species is described by the finite-difference
equation: x_{t+1} = a x_t exp(-x_t), where x_t >= 0 and a is a
positive constant.  
<ol>

<li>Determine the fixed points.
<li>Evaluate the stability of the fixed points.
<li>For what value of a is the first period-doubling bifurcation?
<li>For what values of a will the population go extinct starting from
any initial condition?
<li>Suppose you were to make a bifurcation diagram for this equation
as a function of a.  What do you think the bifurcation diagram would
look like and why?  Which features of the diagram could you predict,
and which couldn't you?
<li>(<i>optional</i>)Using a computer, generate a bifurcation diagram
as a function of a. <p>
</ol>

-->

<li>For the logistic map
 <ol>
 <li> Calculate the fixed point as a function of r.
 <li> Algebraically determine the r value at which the fixed point
 loses stability. 
 <li> Does the bifurcation diagram confirm your algebraic
 calculation?<p> 
</ol>
<br>

<!--
<li>Using the programs available on my website <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos">here</a>, determine whether
or not the logistic equation is chaotic for r = 3.5699456718695445.
Discuss.
