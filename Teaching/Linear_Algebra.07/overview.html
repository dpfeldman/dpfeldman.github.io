<b>Course Catalog Description:</b>

Through the study of linear algebra in this course, students will
acquire powerful analytic techniques that are essential tools in
almost any field of applied mathematics, including: physics,
engineering, computer science, economics.  Linear algebra is also
commonly used in chemistry and mathematical biology.  Our study of
linear algebra will begin by abstracting and formalizing the idea
behind solving familiar systems of linear equations.  This will lead
us to the study of matrices and determinants.  We will study these
mathematical objects both algebraically and geometrically, leading up
to a general treatment of linear vector spaces.  Additional topics
covered will include: linear transformations; inner products and
orthogonality; eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and their application. Where
possible, applications to students' fields of interest will be
emphasized.  Students will leave this course with a solid foundation
in the key ideas and techniques of linear algebra.  Evaluation will be
based on class participation and weekly problem sets.<br><br>

Please note that this course meets the QR requirement.  It does not
meet the ES requirement.

I have several goals for this course:
<ol>
<li>I want you to get a solid foundation in linear algebra which you can
then apply to areas of your interest.
<li>I want you to increase your "mathematical sophistication," ability
to reason abstractly, and give you an introduction to some of the more
formal ideas of mathematics, including proofs. 
    <li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
    solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  This includes using
    computers to help you set up and solve problems.
<li>I want to have fun while working hard and learning some
    challenging material.  
</ol>

Our textbook will be <a
href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linalg.html/">Linear Algebra</a> by
<a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/math/hefferon.html">Jim
Hefferon</a>.  This book is available in pdf form for free at the URL
above.  I would like to cover most of the first four chapters of this
text.  This will be a brisk pace, but I think it is doable.

Your evaluation will be based almost exclusively on weekly homework
assignments.  In most cases, you will be responsible for correcting
your own assignments. 
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  In general, I strongly recommend against grades; I believe
they are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
learning.

Policies and Course Details:
<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Linear_Algebra.07">
http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Linear_Algebra.07</a>. 

<li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day.
Chronically late homework assignments will result in me likely
mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
lowering of your grade.    

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
can also consult me, other faculty, friends,
and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>There will be some assignments for which you will need to use
Maple to do numerical calculations.  

<!--<li> Information on what is expected for homework solutions can be -->
<!--found <a href="solutions.html">in a separate document</a>.-->

<li>It is much easier for me if you send email to my hornacek
account and not at any of my other addresses. 

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
integrity</a> passed by the faculty several winters ago.

<li>A more informal description of the course can be found <a
href="expectations.html">here</a>.
