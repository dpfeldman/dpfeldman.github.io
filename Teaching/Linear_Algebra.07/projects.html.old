<h1 align=center> Chaos and Complex Systems: Final Projects</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

<h4>Overview</h4>

The final project should be an in-depth exploration of some area of
mathematics or physics related to chaos and complex systems.
In your project you should strive for depth; avoid doing a broad
survey.  We should meet soon to discuss possible topics.<p> 

<br>
<h4>Initial pre-presentation</h4>
Approximately week five (we'll set the date later), you will give an
initial presentation in which you introduce your topic.  You
should give your audience a sense of what you'll be doing the next
several weeks and the questions you'll wish to address.  There are
several goals for this initial presentation.
<ol>
<li>Force you to choose a topic early rather than later.
<li>Let other people in the class know what you're up to; get feedback
and ideas from others.
<li>Give you a chance to practice giving technical presentations.
You'll get feedback on your presentation from both me and classmates.
</ol>

Since the pre-presentation is intended for people in the class, it
will likely be rather technical.  Presentations will be around 10-15
minutes.  You should use overhead transparencies.  Powerpoint is
strongly discouraged.<p>

We may have to prolong class or schedule an evening session so we can
have all the presentations on the same day.<p>

<br>

<h4>Final Presentations</h4>

On November 19, Friday of week 10, we will give presentations in a
session open to the community. In a few weeks we will decide on a
format.  The session will involve some combination of talks, posters,
and papers. <p><br>
