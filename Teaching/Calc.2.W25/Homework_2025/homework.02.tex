%\noindent There are three parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework 02 on WeBWorK. The
WeBWorK page is here:
\url{https://webwork-hosting.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es3012m-winter2025}. \\ 

%I recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the homework first.  This will
%enable you to benefit WeBWorK's instant feedback before you do part
%two.\\ 


\noindent {\bf Part 3: A Coding Exercise}. Do the following on a new
google colab notebook. When you are done, please attach the notebook
on google classroom. Write a notebook that does the following:


\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
\item Use the {\tt def} command to define the function
  \begin{equation}
    f(x) \, = \, 0.2 + \sqrt{0.25x} \;.
  \end{equation}
\item Write code that will evaluate the following definite
  integral. (Remember, ``definite interal'' is just a fancy name for
  total accumulated change.
  \begin{equation}
    \int_0^3 0.2 + \sqrt{0.25t} \, dt \;.
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Hints/reminders:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
\item Remember to import the modules you need.
\item Remember to put {\tt np.} in front of any math functions you
  need from {\tt numpy}.
\item The square root function in python is {\tt sqrt}. In other words: 
  \begin{equation}
    \sqrt{613x^2} \, \text{ is {\tt np.sqrt(613*x**2)} in python.}
  \end{equation}
\item Multiplication is indicated by a {\tt *}.  I.e., it's {\tt
  10*x}, not {\tt 10x}. \\
\end{itemize}


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Non-WeBWorK problems}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type.
\item If you like working on a tablet, go for it. 
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Please, I am begging you, please don't scan your work in
    sideways. \smiley{}
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  %(Between my two classes I will be receiving
  %around 60 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email 
  %is challenging.)
\item If you want, you can do the non-WeBWorK and coding in pairs and
  submit only one assignment for the two of you. \\
\end{itemize}

\noindent Here is a non-WeBWorK problem.\\

\noindent The figure below shows the rate at which sleet is falling,
in units of centimeters per hour, during the first three hours of a
sleet storm in Maine.

\label{fig:graph1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%\vspace{0mm}


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Come up with a lower estimate for the total amount of sleet
    that has fallen during the first three hours of the storm. use
    $\Delta t = 0.5$ hours.
  \item Draw the area representing this lower estimate on the graph. 
  \item Come up with an upper estimate for the total amount of sleet
    that has fallen during the first three hours of the storm. use
    $\Delta t = 0.5$ hours.
  \item As $\Delta t$ gets smaller and smaller, the upper and lower
    estimates get closer and closer to each other. How small a $\Delta
    t$ would you need to choose so that the difference between the
    upper and lower estimates was $0.1$ cm.
\end{enumerate}
