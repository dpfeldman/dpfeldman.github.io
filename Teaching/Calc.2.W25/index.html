      <h4>Calculus I: Change Happens</h4>
      <h4>Calculus II: Changes Accumulate</h4>

      <p>In Calculus I, one learns how to describe change. The
      derivative tells us the instantaneous rate of a function. For a
      line, the rate of change is simple: it's just the line's
      slope.<p> 

      <p>In Calculus II, we'll think about how changes
	accumulate. Given a rate of change over a period of time, how 
	much total change has occurred. If the change rate is constant,
	the process is simple: the total change is the rate of change
	times the time. But what to do if the rate of change isn't
	constant? Under those circumstances, how might we determine
	the total change? In Calculus II we'll thoroughly answer these
	questions.</p> 

      <p>This is not a traditional Calculus II class! I have taught
      Calc II many times (14, to be exact). And I have been increasingly
      unhappy with the material in past versions of the class. The
      traditional topics taught in the traditional way are, at best,
      somewhat tedious and not current. At worst, a traditional
      Calculus II class teaches students to do things that computers
      can do for you, which ends up not only being unnecessary but
      actively obscures the key ideas of integral calculus. So I'm
      going to try something new, which I piloted the last time I
      taught the class. Here's some of what I'm thinking.  
	<ul>
	  <li>I am convinced that coding up some of the ideas and
	    procedures from integral calculus is a great way to gain a
	    true conceptual understanding. So we'll learn some basic
	    python as part of this class.</li> 
	  <li>The main goal of learning python is to use it to learn
	    calculus. But, of course, programming is a super valuable
	    skill that is used across the sciences, the social
	    sciences, and basically everywhere. Programming is also
	    super fun. </li> 
	  <li>Since this class will be small, I would like to do a lot
	  more "hands-on" explorations and even less lecturing than I
	    usually do.</li>
	  <li>What sort of hands-on explorations? New this
	    year: <b>model rockets<i class="fa fa-rocket
	    fa-fw"></i><i class="fa fa-rocket fa-fw"></i><i class="fa
	    fa-rocket fa-fw"></i></b>! We'll all build and launch
	    model 
	    rockets. We'll then use flight data and the model rocket
	    engine's thrust curves to analyze rates of change and
	    accumulated changes. In this case, the accumulated change
	    we're interested in is the height of the rocket.</li>   
	</ul>
	The <a href="https://www.msgc.org/" target="_blank">Maine Space
	Grant Consortium</a> is helping to fund the model rocket part of
	the course. Thank you, MSGC!</p>
      
      <p>Btw, this course meets the following degree
      requirements: <b>QR</b> and <b>ES</b> </p>

      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician Federico Ardila-Mantilla has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are:
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math is a powerful, malleable tool that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.

      <h3><i class="fa fa-building-o fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Structure and Pacing</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>We will kinda sorta cover chapters 5-10 in
	    this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deborah-Hughes-Hallett-Calculus-Single-Multivariable/dp/B008UBBTME/">textbook</a>, 
	    but I won't be following the book closely at
	    all. Thus, <b>there is no required text for this
	    class</b>.</li>  
	  <li>This class meets three times a week. There is not a
	    dedicated lab time. </li>
	  <li>Some weeks, depending on scheduling and weather and
	  life, class may only meet twice a week.</li> 
	</ol>
      </p>

      <p>
	There will be several different parts to the course, each with
	a somewhat different feel: 
	<ul>
	 <li>Accumulation of change. Here we'll learn different ways
	   to calculate accumulated change. This will involve a good
	   bit of programming. This part of the course will probably
	   seem unrelated to Calculus I, and at times may seem a
	   little bit more like a programming class than a math
	   class. Toward the end of this part we'll introduce a
	   construction known as the definite integral.</li> 
	 <li>The fundamental theorems of calculus. This part will be
	   less computational and more mathematical. We'll see that
	   the change accumulator (the definite integral) is closely
	   related to the derivative from Calculus I. So at this point
	   it should become clearer why this course is called Calculus
	   II.</li> 
	 <li>Applications of integrals. Here we will learn several
	   different ways that the definite integral gets used. We'll
	   likely have seen some of the applications or contexts in the
	   first part of the course, but now we'll be able to explore
	   them in a little more depth.</li> 
	 <li>Sequences and series. This is a topic that is somewhat
	   separate from the rest of the course. This part of the course
	   will be a mix of programming and pencil-and-paper math. This
	   part of the course will have a different feel to it. Most
	   students find this a nice change of pace and a good way to
	   end the course. (However, depending on how the rockets go,
	   we might do some work with differential equations instead
	   of sequences and series.)</li> 
      </ul>
      </p>
      

      
      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Stuff about Homework</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be an assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
	  essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
	  math, and also this is most of what your evaluation will be based
	  on.</li> 
	  <li>The main work for this course will be weekly homework
	    assignments. There will also be a final synthetic
	    assignment toward the end of the term.</li>
	  <li>All work can be <b>resubmitted without penalty</b> up to
	    (roughly) a few weeks after I return it to you.</li>
	<!--<li><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
	I think it would be best to not use google classroom to
	submit homework, but instead to submit the assignments on
	actual pieces of paper, like in olden times. But let's
	discuss this.</li>-->
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
	  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest working
	  with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family. However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3><i class="fa fa-commenting-o fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Other Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <!--<li><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> More than
	    any class I teach, in Thermodynamics I find myself
	    lecturing at the board. This has worked well in the
	    past. However, we could consider partially "flipping" the
	    class. I.e., doing reading before we cover a topic in
	    class, or watching videos from the 2021 hybrid version of
	    the course.</li>-->
	  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific
	    calculator or phone/tablet app. I strongly suggest an
	    actual calculator. You do not need a graphing calculator
	    for this course (or, in my opinion, ever).</li>
	  <li>Since we'll be doing coding, you'll need to have a
	  laptop or tablet to code on. All the work we'll will be in
	  the cloud, so there's no need to download any software.
	  <li><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
	    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
	    There is only one teaching assistant for this class. We'll
	    have to figure out how to optimally schedule help
	    sessions. Since this class is small, I'm confident that
	    we'll be able to figure things out. </li> 
	  <li>I would also encourage you to schedule some group work
	    times without me.</li>
	  <li> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-fw"></i>
	    You will probably also need to schedule time outside of
	    class to work on model rockets and also some other
	    explorations/challenges. </li>
	  <li> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-fw"></i>
	    Since most of this course is non-traditional, I would
	    encourage you to not consult other calculus references, as
	    doing so may be confusing. (There are some exceptions to
	    this, which I'll mention as the course progresses.)</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3><i class="fa fa-life-saver fa-fw
		    w3-margin-right"></i>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3><i class="fa fa-user-o fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email.  There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for energy projects on campus
	    or in the community.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the
	TAs. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-bullseye fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>What your
      Evaluation is Based on</h3> 
      
      <p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
	assignments. I think there is much to be said against grades; I 
	believe they often interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But
	I am happy to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of
	A's, B's, etc. 
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-universal-access fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is my intent that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know.  You can also reach out to Provost
	<a href="https://www.coa.edu/live/profiles/1134-ken-hill" target="_blank">Ken
	Hill</a> or Associate Dean

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-institution fa-fw
		    w3-margin-right"></i>Statements about Academic Honesty
	  and Hours of Academic Engagement</h3>
      <p>I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</p>
	    
	  <p>I am also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you'll spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </p>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important
      to acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
