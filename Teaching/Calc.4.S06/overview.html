<h3>Goals</h3>

<ol>
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want you to understand and know how to use the main elements of
vector calculus: the divergence, gradient, and curl; line and surface
integrals; and Greens Theorem, Stokes Theorem, and the Divergence
Theorem.  We will also cover multidimensional integrals in Cartesian,
Polar, Cylindrical, and Spherical Coordinates.

<li>I want to help you get ready for more advanced math and physics
classes by doing some challenging problems that will "stretch" you
some. 

<li>I want to have fun while working hard and learning a lot. 
</ol>
<p>

I hope to cover chapters 16-20 of our textbook.  This is similar to the
material covered in most other Calc IV courses at colleges and
universities with trimesters or quarters.  At some schools such a
course would be called vector analysis or vector calculus instead of
Calculus IV.<p> 



<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<br>
Your evaluation will be based roughly on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 90 percent.
<li><b>Class and Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I recommend against grades; I believe they are more likely than not to
interfere with genuine, reflective learning.  However, I will assign
grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines in the COA
Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br> 

<h3>Policies, Advice, and Stuff:</h3>

<ol>

<li>Our textbook will be McCallum, Hughes-Hallett, et al.,
<i>Calculus: Multivariable</i>.  4th edition.  J. Wiley.  2005.  ISBN:
0-471-48480-6. 

<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning this
in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your grade.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>Since this is a tutorial, in some cases you will be correcting
your own homework.  

<li>In addition to the regular homework assignments, I'd like to do
three in-depth assignments:  one that is a challenging set of Maple
problems, one that is a challenging theory problem or a by-hand
calculation, and one that is an interesting application of vector
calculus. 

<li>Unless students prefer otherwise, I do not plan on giving any
exams in this class.  

<li>You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
trigonometry, and logarithms.  There's no need to buy an expensive
graphing calculator.  

<li>The first half of this course, when we focus on multivariable
integration, will be a little "messy".  The second half of the course
will be more elegant and less algebra-intensive.  

<li>We will be making use of Maple for this class.  Maple is an
extremely powerful mathematics package that can do graphical,
numerical, and symbolic computations.  

<li>I will be sending out class info via email.  Thus, it's important
that you check your email.

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty winter term, 1999.
