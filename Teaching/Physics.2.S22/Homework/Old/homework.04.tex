%{\bf {\LARGE This problem set is not complete. I might add a few
%    additional problems.}} \\

\noindent There is only one part to this assignment. There is no
WeBWorK this week.\\ 

%\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.
%Do Homework 02 which you will find
%on your
%\href{https://webwork.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es1026i-winter-2022/}{WeBWorK
%  page}.  I recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the 
%homework first.  This will enable you to benefit from WeBWorK's
%instant, if not necessarily friendly, feedback before you do part two.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  around 45 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
  is challenging.)
\item {\bf If you want, do these problems in pairs.} Most of these
  problems are exploratory in nature, and it might be fun to have a
  co-explorer. If you do work in pairs,
  please submit only one set of solutions for the two of you.  If you
  work with a friend and your friend submits the work, please submit
  an empty assignment and add a comment letting me know who you worked
  with.  Thanks.
%\item Do problem 40 in pairs. Work with someone else in the class
%  and hand in only one solution for the two of you.
%\item If you want, you can do all the problems in pairs and hand
%  in only one set of solutions.\\
