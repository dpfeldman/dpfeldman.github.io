  <p>here's what i hope you learn in this course</b>
  <h2>Course Goals</h2>
</header>

<ol> 
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative analytical skills,
    problem solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
<li>I want you to learn several big physics ideas: conservation of
    energy, momentum, and angular momentum, and Newton's laws, and be
    able apply these ideas in quantitative and qualitative settings. 
</ol>
<p>Basically the idea is to learn some physics and also to learn some of
the analytical and quantitative skills that physicists use. These
include: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Developing a systematic, organized, and effective approach to
    problem solving 
  <li> Becoming comfortable and confident making approximations and
    estimations 
  <li>Mastering unit conversions and gaining familiarity with dimensional analysis 

</ol>




<header class="align-center">
  <p>some nuts and bolts</b>
  <h2>About this Course</h2>
</header>

<ul>
<li> There will be several problem solving sessions in the dining hall
  each week. I can meet individually by appointment.
<li> TAs: Goya van den Berg.
<li> Thomas A. Moore. <emph>Six Ideas that Shaped Physics: Unit C:
  Conservation Laws Constrain Interactions</emph>, second

  <p>some important but not very exciting details</b>
  <h2>Policies and Stuff</h2>
</header>
<ul>

<ul>
   <li> Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day. More than
   one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning
   this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of
   your grade. 

   <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
   can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends, and
   family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
   understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
   problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
   photocopy their solution and turn it in. 

   <li> Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially)
   untimed. You may not, however, get any help from any humans during
   the exam. 

   <li> I will almost always assign reading for each class. You should
   do the reading. I strongly recommend reading over the chapter
   before class and being prepared with questions and comments. 

   <li> You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
   trigonometry, and logarithms. There's no need to buy an expensive
   graphing calculator. 

   <li> I expect you to attend labs.

   <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
   important that you check your email. 

   <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
     subscribing to common standards of academic honesty. Any
     cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
     breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
     responsibility to not use words or works of others without proper
     acknowledgment.  Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence of such
     activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her designee.
     Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for dismissal
     from the college. Students should request in-class discussions of
     such questions when complex issues of ethical scholarship arise. 
   <li> Workload: In addition to the 4.5 hours of scheduled class time
   every week, I expect that between readings, going over notes, and
   doing assignments you will spend at least an additional 10.5 hours
   a week on this course, for a total of at least 150 hours over the
   term devoted to this class.   
</ul>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>further musings</b>
  <h2>Some Thoughts about the Course</h2>
</header>
<ul>

  <li>I've taught this class ten times before, so I have a good feel
  for how this class will go.  I'm going to try a few new things
  with the labs.  Inevitably, some of these things will work better
  than others. 

    <li> There will be times in class when we go over something that
    you already understand. There may also occasionally be times when
    you feel lost in class for a little bit. If this happens, don't
    despair. Ask a question or talk to me or one of the TAs after
    class. 

    <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
    confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
    sooner rather than later. This course builds on itself&mdash;what we do
    in week three will depend on what we did in week two, what we do
    in week four depends on week three, etc. There are many people
    around who can offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if
    we don't know who needs it when. You need to take responsibility
    to seek help if you need it. On a related note ... 

    <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
    first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated&mdash;I strongly suggest
    working with others and seeking help if you need it. I also
    strongly suggest that you start the homework well before it's
    due. 

    <li> In many math and physics classes the
    textbook has a ton of examples in them. The book we'll be using
    doesn't. The result is that students sometimes find the homework
    to be challenging, frustrating, and occasionally even
    annoying. However, I'm convinced that this style of homework&mdash;where
    there's not an example just like the problem you're trying to
    do&mdash;is much better pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this
    way. 

    <li> This course covers fairly standard Physics I material. The
    only exception to this is that our book begins with conservation
    laws, and leaves Newton's laws for later. There are a few other
    texts that do this, but most do it the other way around. The text
    book we're using is used at many other colleges and universities
    in the U.S. If you've had Physics before, in high school or at
    another college, you'll probably find most of the material
    familiar. You should talk with me to make sure that this course
    won't be too much review for you. 

    <li> This class is listed as an introductory course. I do not
    assume that you've had physics before. Although our textbooks
    occasionally use calculus, calculus is most definitely not a
    prerequisite for this class. This class makes extensive use of
    algebra and trigonometry. If you've never had trig before, you can
    still take this class, but you might have some extra work you'll
    need to do the first few weeks. In the past, students without a
    trig background have taken this class and done fine. 

    <li> This class is a lot of work. However, the workload is fairly
    steady; you'll be doing approximately the same amount of work each
    week. We'll hit the ground running and try to get lots of stuff
    done the next few weeks. The workload will taper off some toward
    the end of the term. 

    <li>The workload in this class starts off heavier and increases in
    difficulty and amount the first several weeks.  After around week
    three and chapter C5 things will level off and perhaps even get
    easier. 

    <li> Labs in this class may be different than those you've
    encountered in other science classes. There will not be a formal
    write-up, aka a "lab report", due at the end of the lab. Instead,
    the emphasis is on playing/experimenting with some equipment,
    trying some stuff out, and learning some skills we won't get a
    chance to go over in class. The exercises are, at times, open
    ended and deliberately vague.  They're not busy work. I think it's
    important to approach labs with this in mind. Don't try to rush
    through; if you put a little extra time and thought into the labs
    you'll get much more out of them.  Also, sometimes labs may be
    puzzles or exploratory word problems. 

</ul>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>what i'm looking for</b>
  <h2>Homework</h2>
</header>
<ul>



Problem write-ups are your permanent record of your understanding
of the material covered.  You will want your homework solutions to be
  understandable to you when you are taking the exams.
<ol>   
<li>Solutions should be clearly and logically presented.  This means
that:
<ul>
<li>Your method should always be clear.  It should be easy to figure
out what you're doing and why.
<li>Use a lot of space.  I recommend using unlined paper; there's an
almost unlimited supply of this in the recycling bins, and not having
lines encourages you to write large and give yourself space.  If you
are unable to liberate yourself from lined paper, try skipping some
lines.
<li>Equations should usually be accompanied by prose.  Before plunging
into algebra, state what it is you're solving for.  If there are any
non-obvious steps in a calculation, explain them.
<li>Write equations in a logical order.
</ul>

<li>Solutions should stand on their own; they should be understandable
to someone who hasn't read the problem.  You should almost always
paraphrase the question before writing your response.

<li>The reason I emphasize writing up your problem solutions clearly
  and thoroughly is not because I am a neat freak or that I want to
  impose a style on you. Rather, I am convinced (and there is evidence
  in support of this proposition), that the act of writing helps to
  focus one's thoughts and engages your mind, leading to more enduring
  learning. 


<li>You should aim to develop some sort of semi-structured style for
  solving problems. Different people have different styles. But good,
  experienced problem-solvers all have some sort of system that they
  use. 

<li>I will not give numerical grades on HW assignments.  Instead, I
will give a letter grade and try to include as many comments as I
can.  I'm mainly interested in seeing that you thoughtfully attacked
the problem and wrote it up in a clear and coherent way. It is better
  to be clear and wrong than unclear and right. If you only want
  comments and don't want a letter grade on your HW, please write a
  note to this effect on the top of your assignment. 

<li> Finally, a few minor requests:
<ol>
<li>On the top of the homework, please write the assignment number.
<li>Please do the problems in order.  It's very time-consuming to have
to hunt around for your problems.
<li>If you don't have a stapler, that's ok.  But please don't mangle
and fold over the corner in an attempt to get the pages to stick
together.  Just write your name or initials on all pages and I'll
gladly staple them together.
<li>Please don't hand in problems on paper that has been torn out of a
spiral notebook.



</ul>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>you can get help, and a lot more, at help sessions</b>
  <h2>Help Sessions</h2>
</header>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions.
You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these sessions.
Things that happen at help session:
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.
  <li>Other students do the problems at home or in the library and
    come to the help session with specific questions. 
  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also wander into other areas: politics,
    the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes are
    offered next term, and so on.
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.
</ol>
Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>there are lots of good reasons why you might want to meet with me
    one-on-one</p>
  <h2>Individual Meetings</h2>
</header>
I am happy to meet with students one-on-one, either in my office or in
the dining hall.  The best way to set up an appointment is to send me
an email.  There are lots of reasons why you might want to me:
<ol>
  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
    explore in a help session.
  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
  uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
  uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
  questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
  nevertheless.)
  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
    internships, senior projects, etc.
</ol>  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
discuss. </p>
