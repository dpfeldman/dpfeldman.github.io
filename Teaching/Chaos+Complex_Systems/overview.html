<h3>Course Overview
</h3>


I have several main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>

<li>I want to help you gain experience in and appreciation for a
variety of different styles and flavors of mathematics.  We will do a
lot of different things in this course, and almost all of them should
be really fun and interesting.  

<li>I want you to gain experience working with and critically
evaluating different mathematical models.

<li>I want you to do an in-depth, focused study of a particular
mathematical model or technique.

<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want to have fun while working hard and learning some
challenging material. 

</ol>
<p>

But what is this course really about?
<ol>
<li>Several themes will run through all of what we do:  order and
randomness, simplicity and complexity.  What do these terms mean?
What are the relationships between them?    
<li><i> American society ...  operates under the delusion that we are
each a kind of ``solitary knower'' --- that we exist as rootless 
intelligences without layers of localized contexts.  Just a ``self''
and the ``world.''  In this there is no real recognition that
grandparents, place, grammar, pets, friends, lovers, children, tools,
the poems and songs we remember, are what we think with. (Gary
Snyder, Tawny Grammar.)</i>  I hope that the topics we explore in this
course will give you some new things to think with.
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Text(s)</h3>

Our primary text will be <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/FLAOH/cbnhtml/index.html"><i>The
Computational Beauty of Nature</i></a> (CBN) by Gary Flake.  Note,
however, that CBN isn't a textbook in the normal sense.  It's much
more interesting than many texts, and there aren't problems at the end
of each chapter.  Although you could get by without buying a copy, I
recommend purchasing one. The paperback edition is around $30.00.  We
will also do readings from a variety of other sources, including
several textbooks, web sites, research papers, and articles.<p>


At a bare minimum, I expect we'll cover the material in the following
chapters of CBN: 5, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20.  Many of these
chapters are fairly brief; we'll supplement them with other readings.
I also want to spend some time on graphs and networks.  These topics
aren't covered in CBN.  As time permits, we may also discuss symbolic
dynamics, incomputability and incompleteness, Mandelbrot and Julia
sets, and other things.<p>
<br>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based loosely on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 45 percent.
<li><b>Week 5 Presentation:</b> 10 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 35 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on>page 8 of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  There will be no exams.<p><br> 



<h3>Final Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Can take many forms -- need not be a paper.  We will discuss as 
a class whether or not we want to have a set of presentations open to
the coa community, or if we just want to present to the class.
<li>  Should be on some topic that's interesting to you.
<li>  Must be more than a "book report";  you should <i>do</i>
something:  some analysis, programming, problems, etc.
<li> You and I share responsibility for the project.  I will try to
meet with you all individually and discuss possible projects.  But you
also need to take some initiative; if you're feeling lost or confused,
be assertive and find me sooner rather than later.
<li>  I strongly encourage you to work on projects in groups.  Perhaps
you'll end up doing separate projects, but maybe a few of you have
broadly similar interests.  If this is the case, I suggest doing some
common background readings and meeting to discuss as a group.
<li> I will give you more information about project expectations 
sometime during week two. 
<p>
</ul>



<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Complex_Systems">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Complex_Systems</a>. 

<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me likely mentioning
this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your
grade.   

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li> Information on what is expected for your final presentation can be
found <a href="projects.html">in a separate document</a>. 

<li> Information on what is expected in homework solutions can be
found <a href="solutions.html">in a separate document</a>.

<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading before class and come prepared to discuss.

<li>In order to make time for final presentations, we'll need to
schedule a few extra classes toward the end of the term.

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
information via email, it is important that you check your email
regularly.  

<li>I expect you to attend class.

<li>For the assignments and/or your final project, you may wish to use
the computer algebra system Maple.  If you haven't learned to love
Maple yet, you will soon.  <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Maple">Here is a page with Maple
info</a>.  There are also a few Maple books on reserve in our library. 

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
integrity</a> passed by the faculty several winters ago.
