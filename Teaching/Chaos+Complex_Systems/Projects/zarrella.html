<h3>Ecological and Spatial Simulation of Darwin's Finches</h3>
</center>
<br>

Game theory is a mathematical formalism of differing strategies
played against one another that is used to simulate political, social,
and ecological complex systems.  In my presentation, five different
strategies interact over several hundred time-steps, their fitness is
evaluated, and this fitness changes with increasing environmental
variation.  Both ecological and spatial simulations are used and I
examine how these strategies and outcomes can be applied to a
real-world ecological example: Darwin's finches.
