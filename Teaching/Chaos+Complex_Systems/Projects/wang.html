<h3>When does disease become endemic?</h3>
</center>
<br>
<p>
 S-I-S stands for susceptible-infective-susceptible. It is a
 mathematical model for some infectious diseases that do not confer
 immunity. An S-I-S disease has the potential to become endemic, that
 is, approach a nonzero limit in the fractions of susceptible and
 infected people. The disease never goes away. The project is to find
 mathematical conditions that say when the disease becomes endemic. As
 with any model, it has limitations. It will not give us exact
 answers, but it will help us to see the general trends and make some
 important predictions.
