<h3>Measuring Randomness, Uncertainty, and Structure in Two
Universality Classes</h3> 
</center>
<br>
<p>
The study of phase transitions in systems as diverse as magnets,
fluids, liquid crystals, and superconductors has revealed a similarity
in dynamics that allows them to be placed into universality
classes. The exact number of these classes is a subject of discussion,
but there at least two distinct classes acknowledged; Parity
Conserving (PC) and Directed Percolation (DP).  Both of these system
types were simulated by using several Cellular Automata models.
Several Information Theoretical  measurements were extrapolated from
these models.  These quantities make it possible to draw conclusions
about randomness, uncertainty, and structure in DP and PC universality
classes, and the cellular automata that belong to each class.
