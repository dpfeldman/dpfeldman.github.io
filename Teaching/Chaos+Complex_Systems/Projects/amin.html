<h3>Social Networks at COA</h3>
</center>
<br>
  In my project, the social network analysis I have chosen is
  information flow in College of the Atlantic. With this, I will look
  at a number of different properties networks have.  For instance, I
  will look at properties like "In-Degree" "Out-Degree" which are
  associated with directed networks.  I will also look at how
  clustered COA community is.  At the bottom line, there will be all
  kinds of interpretations like "who is the most well known?"
