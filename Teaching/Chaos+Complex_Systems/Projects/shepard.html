<h3>The Two- and Three-Body Problems</h3>
</center>
<br>
My project is based on the relationship between the two body and three
body problem, namely why one is solvable and the other isn't. To
properly illustrate this I will be going over the history of the two
and three body problem as well as showing what happens between various
intial conditions in each situation. I will also include pictures
showing what happens with each intial condition given.
