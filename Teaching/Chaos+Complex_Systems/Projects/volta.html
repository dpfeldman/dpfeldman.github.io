<h3>Fractal Networks as a Model for River Basin Development</h3>
</center>
<br>

This project examines the use of network and fractal models to explain
the creation and growth of river basins. It is an attempt to
understand if and how some order can be found in the apparent
randomness of the dynamics behind drainage networks. By looking at the
variety of factors that concur into shaping a river basin and
representing them in a mathematical model, we can try to comprehend
the complex interactions between chance and physical causality that
are at the heart of the river's development.
