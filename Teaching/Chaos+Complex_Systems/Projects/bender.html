<h3>Chaos in Music</h3>

<br>
 How does the human creative process work? Do we ever unconsciously
 produce chaos- or fractal-related art? Can chaotic, fractal, or
 stochastic mechanisms ever replicate or imitate human creativity? Or
 even if they can't, can they facilitate the production of
 aesthetically pleasing music? These questions will be examined, and a
 selection of fractal music will be presented. <p>
