      <h4>Physics and Math of Sustainable Energy: Official Course Description</h4>
      <p>In this course students will learn content and skills so that they can participate effectively in sustainable energy projects, make personal and community decisions that reduce carbon emissions, and work in ventures in sustainable energy. Additionally, this course will be useful for those interested in energy and climate policy, either internationally or domestically. We will begin with a quick overview of current CO2 emissions levels and look at how this is related to energy use. We will then turn our attention to basic ideas from physics, including the definition of energy and the difference between energy and power. The bulk of the course will consist of a survey of different forms of energy consumption and generation. Throughout, we will quantitatively analyze technology from both a local and global point of view. For example, we will calculate how much electricity one can generate on a rooftop, and we will also examine the role that solar PV could play toward the goal of eliminating fossil fuel use worldwide. In a unit on financial mathematics, students will learn about the time value of money and several ways of quantifying investments, including ROI (return on investment) and IRR (internal rate of return). Students will apply these financial tools in several short case studies. If time permits, we may also cover negative emissions technologies and the electrical grid, including grid stability issues and the potential of smart-grid technology.

    <!-- Axioms Section -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-64 w3-large" id="axioms">
      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician Federico Ardila-Mantilla has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are
	(slightly re-written to apply to physics as well as math): 
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical and physics potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math and physics experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math and physics are powerful, malleable tools that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.  
	</blockquote>

      <h1>More Course Info and Advice</h1>
      <h3>Structure and Pacing</h3>
<p>
This is my fifteenth time teaching this course, so I have a pretty good 
sense of how it will go. This class has several, overlapping parts:
	<ol>
	  <li>During the first 1-2 weeks of the class we'll spend some time
	    building community.</li>    
	  <li>The first 1-4(ish) weeks we'll cover some core material and
	    build up some skills. We'll cycle back to to key ideas
	    frequently. This course is about building quantitative and
	    analytical skills, and the only way to do this is through lots of
	    practice. Weeks two-four may be a little challenging as you get
	    your feet under you and (re)develop some skills. </li>
	  <li>The last half of the class you'll have a solid base of skills
	    and so the mechanics of the homework will likely go more smoothly,
	    while the physics and climate implications of what we cover will
	    get more and more interesting.</li>
	  <li>At some point toward the middle of the course we'll take a
	    little detour and learn some financial mathematics. You will
	    likely find this more interesting than you think you're going to
	    find it. Really.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      
      <p>There are two <b>lab</b> sections for the course. You should
	attend one lab session each week. Please attend the same lab each
	week if possible, but if not, it's not a big deal.</p>
      
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Stuff about Homework</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be an assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
	  essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
	  math, and also this is most of what your evaluation will be based
	  on.</li> 
	<li>There will be two parts to almost every homework assignment:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	      google classroom</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. There are three
	  reasons why I use WeBWorK:
	  <ul>
	    <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	      learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	      many times until you get everything correct.</li>
	    <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	      slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	      collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	      since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	      final answer. </li>
	    <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
	      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	      grading.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
	  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
	  with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
	<li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
	  phone/tablet app. I strongly suggest an actual calculator. You do
	  not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
	  ever). </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>What this Class Isn't</h3>
      <p><ol>
	  <li>This course is not about the following things, although this course
	    should help you do/think about the following things better and
	    more richly.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Energy policy</li>
	      <li>Social impacts of energy technologies</li>
	      <li>Environmental impacts of energy technologies</li>
	      <li>Weatherproofing your house</li>
	      <li>Building your own wind turbine</li>
	      <li>Climate change and global warming</li>
	      <li>A physics class </li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
	    technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
	    There is also a temptation to get bogged down in discussions about
	    policy, ethics, and justice.  We should collectively
	    resist these temptations; there are a lot of important
	    topics to learn about.</li>

	  <li>Many of the examples in this class are based on a US context. I
	    will incorporate other contexts as I can, and will try to make clear
	    differences between the US and elsewhere in terms of energy.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session. They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email. There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session. (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions! But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for energy projects on campus
	    or in the community.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the TAs. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>What your Evaluation is Based on</h3>
      
      <p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
	assignments (approx 90%) and your contributions in lab
	sections (approx 10%).  There will be weekly homework assignments
	and, towards the end of the course, some mini-case studies and
	projects.  I think there is much to be said against grades; I
	believe they often interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But
	I am happy to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of
	A's, B's, etc. 
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is my intent that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know.  You can also reach out to: Provost
	Kourtney
	Collum; <a href="https://www.coa.edu/live/profiles/4668-puranjot-kaur"
	target="_blank">Puranjot

	target="_blank">Maya
	Caines</a>, Restorative Practices Team Coordinator. </p> 

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Gender-based discrimination: Title IX</h3>

      <p>COA is committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and
	inclusive campus where all community members have equal access
	to education and employment. We will not tolerate sexual
	harassment or gender-based discrimination of any kind.</p>
      
      <p>As a faculty member, I am considered a "Responsible
	Employee." This means I am required to share any disclosures
	of sexual or gender-based misconduct with the Title IX
	Coordinator—even if the incident occurred before your time at
	COA. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that anyone
	who has experienced sexual misconduct is offered support,
	information about their rights, and access to available
	resources. Please know that you are not required to respond to
	outreach, and a disclosure does not automatically result in a
	report to law enforcement. </p>
      
      <p>For more information about Title IX, COA’s policies, and
	available resources, please
	visit: <a href="coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix"
		  target="_blank">coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix</a>.</p>
      
      <p>If you would like to ask questions or explore support
	options, you are encouraged to contact COA's Title IX
	Coordinator, Puranjot Kaur, at pkaur@coa.edu. Speaking with
	the Title IX Coordinator does not automatically initiate a
	college resolution process. Much of her work focuses on
	providing supportive measures to help you continue to fully
	participate in COA's programs and activities.</p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      
      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
	Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</li>
	    
	  <li>I am also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you will spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </li> 
	</ul></p>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. Although largely a
      technical class, we will touch upon questions of energy
      colonialism and imperialism. I believe it is important to
      acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p> 
    
    <p>In this class we will learn about non-fossil fuel sources of
      energy. Transitioning to a fossil fuel free society is essential to
      avoid catastrophic climate change. College of the Atlantic, and by
      extention all of us, historically and presently benefit from energy
      provided by inexpensive fossil fuel sources. Again, we are entangled
      with the system that we seek to replace.</p>
