\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework 10 (yes 10, not 08) which you
will find the WeBWorK page here:
\url{https://webwork-hosting.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es1056i-fall2025}
I recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the homework first.  This will
enable you to benefit from WeBWorK's instant feedback before you do part
two.\\ 


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type this assignment.
%\item If you like working on a tablet, go for it. 

\item Please scan your work and submit on google classroom.\\
  
%\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
%  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
%  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
%\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
%  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
%  around 60 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email 
%  is challenging.)\\
\end{itemize}

%\noindent The problems you should do are from {\bf Chapters
%  19 and 26} of the book:  \\ 

\noindent {\bf Chapter 15}
