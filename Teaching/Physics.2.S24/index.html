      <h4>Physics II: Official Course Description</h4>

<p>What are relativity and quantum mechanics, and why were they viewed
  as revolutionary when they were formulated in the early 1900s? How
  and why do relativity and quantum mechanics compel us to discard
  commonsense ideas about the nature of the physical world that are
  part of classical mechanics? Why is there not agreement on how to
  interpret quantum mechanics, and why does quantum mechanics even
  need interpretation? This version of Physics II covers Einstein's
  theory of special relativity and selected topics in quantum
  mechanics, and is designed to introduce students to some of the
  formalism and central results of relativity and quantum mechanics,
  so that they can formulate scientifically grounded answers to the
  above questions. Throughout the course we will start with first
  principles and carefully build toward key results, allowing students
  to see how relativity and quantum mechanics---two of the pillars of
  modern physics---were
  constructed and how they cohere as mathematically consistent and
  experimentally verified theories. The first half of the course will
  cover relativity topics including the principle of relativity,
  spacetime intervals and proper time, coordinate transformations,
  time dilation and Lorentz contraction, and relativistic energy and
  momentum. The second half of the course will turn toward the
  foundations of quantum mechanics, including: spin-1/2 particles,
  wave-particle duality, and Bell's inequalities and the
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. If time permits, we may cover
  additional topics such as blackbody radiation, the photoelectric
  effect, Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, and quantum
  cryptography. To gain a sense of the scientific, social, and
  material context in which the theories of relativity and quantum
  mechanics were developed, we will read a number of papers and book
  chapters by historians and philosophers of science. This course is
  designed to appeal to a wide range of students: both those whose
  interests lie outside of science as well as those who are drawn
  toward the sciences or mathematics. Students who take this course
  should be comfortable working with mathematical
  abstraction. Evaluation is based on weekly problem sets,
  participation in weekly discussion sections, and several short
  reflection assignments. Meets the following degree
  requirements: <b>QR</b> <i>and</i> <b>ES</b>.

      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician Federico Ardila-Mantilla has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are:
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical and physics potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math and physics experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math and physics are a powerful, malleable tools that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.

     <p>This course is closely based on the introductory linear algebra
     class (<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/course/mth-204.htm"
     target="_blank">MTH 204</a>) offered by
     <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/math/" target="_blank">Grand Valley
     State University</a>.  I am grateful to
     <a href="https://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html"
     target="_blank">Professor Matt Boelkins</a>, who shared his
     syllabus and assignments for MTH204. These teaching materials
     were developed collaboratively by the team of faculty at Grand
     Valley who rotate through teaching Linear Algebra.</p>

     <p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://davidaustinm.github.io/"
     target="_blank">David Austin</a> who has made his excellent
     textbook, <a href="" target="_blank">Understanding Linear

      <h1>Course Information and Advice</h1>

      <h3>Course Goals</h3>
      <p><ol>
	  <li>Stay physically and mentally healthy and maintain intellectual
	    and personal connection during a potentially difficult
	    time.</li>
	  <li>Experience the challenge, joy, and beauty of theoretical
	    physics.</li>
	  <li>Gain a firm, grounded, enduring understanding of the basic
	    elements and structure of special relativity and quantum
	    mechanics.</li>
	  <li>Engage with the philosophical and ontological questions
	    surrounding relativity and quantum mechanics. I hope you'll leave
	    this course thinking somewhat differently about space/time,
	    reality, determinism, and causality.</li>
	  <li>I want to help you improve your basic facility with algebra
	    and functions, your problem solving skills, your ability to create
	    and interpret different types of graphs, and your overall
	    mathematical confidence.</li>
	  <!--<li>I want you to gain a sense of how math and physics is done, and
	    gain an awareness that these are not static, "dead" disciplines. I
	    want you to gain a greater understanding of science as an
	    institution and science as a culture, and how science intersects
	    and influences other creative and scholarly areas.</li>-->
	  <li>Have fun while growing and learning. </li>
      </ol></p>
      <hr class="day">

      
      <h3>Course Logistics</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>There are no texts that you need to acquire for this
	    course.</li>
	  <li>For the relativity part of the course I will follow the
	    exposition in Thomas A. Moore,
	    <a href="http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/index.html"
	       target="blank">Six Ideas that Shaped Physics: Unit R: The Laws of 
	      Physics are Frame-Independent</a>, McGraw Hill, 1998. You do not
	    need to purchase the text.  </li>
	  <li>For the relativity portion of the course I will also likely assign
	    short videos to watch. These are videos I made when I taught the
	    class entirely online in the spring of 2020.</li>
	  <li>There will be numerous other readings and videos assigned
	    throughout the course</li>
	  <li>There will be two sorts of work you will do for this
	    course:
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments</b>, described
		below.</li>
	      <li><b>Reflection Assignments</b>. There will be two
		reflection assignments. The goal of these are for you
		to synthesize and explore some of the many
		philosophical, historical, and political questions
		we'll be reading about and discussion. The assignment
		can take any form, and should be the equivalent of a
		2-3 page paper.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>All work can be <b>resubmitted without penalty</b> up to
	    (roughly) a few weeks after I return it to you.</li>
	  <li>Your final evaluation will be roughly weighted as
	  follows: Weekly Homework (70%), Reflection Assignments
	  (20%), Engagement in Discussion Sections (10%).</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Course Structure and Flow</h3>
      <p><ol>

	  <li>I have taught the material in this course a handful of
	    times, and taught this particular combination two springs
	    ago. I think the class worked well then, and I'm confident
	    that it will work well this time around. </li>
	  
	  <li>We will cover special relativity (SR) for approximately the first
	    five weeks of the course and then will turn our attention to quantum
	    mechanics (QM). While there will definitely be consistent threads
	    throughout, in some ways this course may feel like two separate
	    courses. I think that's ok.  </li>
	  
	  <li>Some notes about <b>math</b>.
	    <ul>
	      <li>This class assumes that you have
		some level of comfort with basic algebra. QM and SR are areas of
		physics that defy common sense, so we'll need to lean pretty heavily
		on the mathematical formalism in some places.  The math in most ways
		isn't harder than that of Physics I, but we'll rely on the math in a
		more fundamental way.</li>
	      
	      <li>It is possible get a solid, grounded treatment of SR and QM
		without using math beyond algebra.  However...</li>
	      
	      <li>There are lots of fun and interesting math in QM and SR. I'll
		prepare a number of optional explorations for those who want to
		dig deeper into some of the mathematical underpinnings of QM and
		SR. I would strongly encourage those of you interested and/or
		experienced in math to give some of these explorations a try.
		I'm also happy to set up times outside of class to work through
		some more math-heavy material. </li>
	    </ul>
	  <li>We will do a wide variety of things in the discussion sections:
	    mostly discussing readings, but also we will do some exercises and
	    explorations.</li> 
      </ol></p>
      <hr class="day">

      
    <h3>Electronic Distractions</h3>
      <p>As much as possible, I'd like to minimize the use of laptops, tablets,
	and phones during our class meetings.  There is good evidence that
	these wonderful devices can harm the learning environment, even
	for those who are not using their own devices and are merely exposed
	to the devices of others.</p>
      
      <p>There is no need to ban laptops entirely&mdash;that
	just seems  silly to me.  There may be times in class when we will
	do exercises that require computers, and there will also be moments
	when we might want to grab a device and look up the meaning of a
	word or a historical tidbit or something.  So let's use common sense
	and keep devices holstered except when they're needed, at which
	point we should use them proudly and without apology.</p>
      <hr class="day">
      
      
      <h3>Stuff about Homework</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be an assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
	  essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
	  math, and also this is most of what your evaluation will be based
	  on.</li> 
	<li>There will be two parts to almost every homework assignment:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	      google classroom</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. There are three
	  reasons why I use WeBWorK:
	  <ul>
	    <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	      learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	      many times until you get everything correct.</li>
	    <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	      slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	      collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	      since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	      final answer. </li>
	    <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
	      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	      grading.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them
	  quickly. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly
	  suggest working with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family. However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
	<li>You will need access to a calculator (or the equivalent)
	that has scientific notation.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

<h3>Discussions</h3>
      <p>We will do a lot of different things during discussion section,
	including discussing readings.  These discussions are chance
	for us to explore some of the philosophical, conceptual,
	historical, and social aspects of relativity and quantum
	mechanics.  The readings we do will range widely in content,
	style, and difficulty. There are several goals and motivations
	I have for discussions:</p> 
      <ul>
	<li>The discussions are a chance to figure out some things
	  together. We will be doing some readings that are sometimes
	  difficult and subtle and, I hope, interesting. Working
	  together we can solidify and deepen our understanding. 
	<li>In some of the discussions it will be particularly
    valuable to hear a diversity of opinions. I expect there will be a
	  range of reactions and responses to some of what we read,
    and I think that there is tremendous value to listening to and
    engaging with a diversity of thought. 
      </ul>
      
      <p>Expectations for class discussions:
	<ul>
	  <li>Prepare. Do the reading and think about it. Expect to
	  spend an hour or two preparing, although obviously this will
	  vary a lot from reading to reading. Take notes, write down
	  questions, and prepare responses to any questions I might
	  have posed. 
	  <li>If you can work with a hard copy of the reading. I think
	  it is easier to engage with a text via a physical copy, and
	  as much as possible I don't want us to have laptops open
	  when we meet. 
	  <li> Be present. Listen to others, respond, and contribute
	  your own ideas and questions.  
	</ul>
	
      <p>We should all work to create an inviting atmosphere and
      ensure that there is opportunity for all to contribute. At the
      same time, there is no need for everybody to contribute
      equally. It is natural for some people to talk more than others,
      and I think this is normal and good. Also, I expect that
      students will engage and contribute at different levels,
      depending on prior coursework. I see this diversity of
      backgrounds as a strength and not a weakness; there are roles
      for everyone to play. Asking good questions is as important as
      providing answers.</p> 

      <p>Finally, it goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: the
      point of discussions is not to figure out who is right and who
      is wrong, but to help all of us get to a deeper, and not
      necessarily uniform, understanding.</p>
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email.  There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in math or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the
	TAs. </p>
      <hr class="day"></hr>


      <h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and
      perspectives be well served by this course, that students'
      learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that
      the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a
      resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present materials and
      activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality,
      disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status, ethnicity,
      race, and culture.</p> 
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an
      ongoing process. I am always looking to learn more about power
      and privilege and the harmful effects of racism, sexism,
      homophobia, classism, abelism and other forms of discrimination
      and oppression.  Your suggestions are encouraged and
      appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
      effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other
      students or student groups. If something was said or done in
      class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel
      uncomfortable, please let me know.  You can also reach out to
      Provost Ken Hill, or Associate Deans Kourtney Collum or Jamie
      McKown.</p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      
      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important
      to acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
