<br>

<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 08 April, 2005.</b><p> Please hand in all work
on separate paper -- please don't hand in your work on the photocopied
worksheets.<p> 

<b>Very Important Note:</b>  The lesson numbers below all refer to the
new set of handouts -- not those from the last homework assignment!!!<p>
<br>

<b>Lesson 1: Linear Iteration</b>
<ol>
<li> 6.
</ol>


<b>Lesson 2: Types of Fixed Points</b>
<ol>
<li>1-5.  Straightforward, but a little tedious.
Necessary for the later stuff, though.
<li>7.  This is the most important problem of the batch.
<li>11.  Probably the hardest part of this one is understanding what
the question is asking.  If you're unclear about this, be sure to ask
me or Ian.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Lesson 3: Graphical Iteration</b>
<ol>
<li>1 We probably won't go over this in class until Thursday, so I'd
suggest waiting until after Thursday's class to do this one.  (It's
quick once you know how to do it.)

</ol>
