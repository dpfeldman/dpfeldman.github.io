<h3>Economics and "Econophysics"</h3>

<li> Giovani L. Vasconcelos, A Guided Walk Down Wall Street: an
Introduction to Econophysics. <a href="

http://arXiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408143</a>. 
<blockquote>
  This article contains the lecture notes for the short course ``Introduction
to Econophysics,'' delivered at the II Brazilian School on Statistical
Mechanics, held in Sao Carlos, Brazil, in February 2004. The main goal of the
present notes is twofold: i) to provide a brief introduction to the problem of
pricing financial derivatives in continuous time; and ii) to review some of the
related problems to which physicists have made relevant contributions in recent
years.

<blockquote>
An outline of recent work on complex networks is given from the point
of view of a physicist. Motivation, achievements and goals are
discussed with some of the typical applications from a wide range of
academic fields. An introduction to the relevant literature and useful
resources is also given.

<blockquote>
  The goal of this tutorial is to promote interest in the study of random
Boolean networks (RBNs). These can be very interesting models, since one does
not have to assume any functionality or particular connectivity of the networks
to study their generic properties. Like this, RBNs have been used for exploring
the configurations where life could emerge. The fact that RBNs are a
generalization of cellular automata makes their research a very important
topic. The tutorial, intended for a broad audience, presents the state of the
art in RBNs, spanning over several lines of research carried out by different
groups. We focus on research done within artificial life, as we cannot exhaust
the abundant research done over the decades related to RBNs.

different from other types of networks.  <a
href="http://arXiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0305612">http://arXiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0305612</a>.
<blockquote>
  We argue that social networks differ from most other types of networks,
including technological and biological networks, in two important ways. First,
they have non-trivial clustering or network transitivity, and second, they show
positive correlations, also called assortative mixing, between the degrees of
adjacent vertices. Social networks are often divided into groups or
communities, and it has recently been suggested that this division could
account for the observed clustering. We demonstrate that group structure in
networks can also account for degree correlations. We show using a simple model
that we should expect assortative mixing in such networks whenever there is
variation in the sizes of the groups and that the predicted level of
assortative mixing compares well with that observed in real-world
networks.

Relationships in a Class, <a href="

http://arXiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408125</a>. 
<blockquote>
  A simple model is proposed to simulate the evolution of interpersonal
relationships in a class. The small social network is simply assumed as an
undirected and weighted graph, in which students are represented by vertices,
and the extent of favor or disfavor between two of them are denoted by the
weight of corresponding edge. Various weight distributions have been found by
choosing different initial configurations. Analysis and experimental results
reveal that the effect of first impressions has a crucial influence on the
final weight distribution. The system also exhibits a phase transition in the
final hostility (negative weights) proportion depending on the initial amity
(positive weights) proportion.
