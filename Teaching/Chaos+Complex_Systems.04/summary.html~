<h3>Topics we Covered</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Discrete Dynamical Systems.</b>  (Logistic equation).
Deterministic chaos, quasiperiodicity, attractors and repellors,
sources and sinks, sensitive dependence on initial conditions
(butterfly effect), bifurcations, orbits, fixed point, periodic
points, conditions for stability and instability, strange
attractors, Lyapunov exponent. <p> 

<li><b>Universality</b> of the period-doubling route to chaos,
Feigenbaum's constant. <p>

<li><b>Fractals.</b> Power-laws, scale-free behavior,
self-similarity.  Box-counting dimension.  Difficulty of estimating
dimension.  Averages that "don't exist."  St. Petersberg coin-flipping
game. <p> 

<li><b>Infinite Sets.</b>  Cardinality.  Countable vs. uncountable
infinities.  Construction of the Cantor Set (infinity - infinity =
infinity). <p>

<li><b>Complex Graphs.</b>  Random network models (Erdos-Renyi model).
Clustering coefficient, degree distribution, average degree, average
path length.  Small world networks.  Scale-free networks.  Empirical
studies of networks.<p>

<li><b>Cellular Automata.</b> <p>

<li><b>Random Boolean Networks.</b> (NK-Model, Kauffman Network).  Slow
growth of number of attractors.  Alleged connections with gene
regulation networks.<p>

<li><b>Agent based models</b>.  Compare and contrast with differential
equations.  Alife simulation of Balinese rice temples.  Politics of
simulation. <p>

<!--<li><b>Genetic Algorithms.</b>  Royal Road genetic algorithm.
Evolving Cellular Automata.  Neutral evolution (genetic drift).
Fitness landscapes.<p>-->

<!--<li><b>Game Theory.</b>  Prisoner's dilemma.  Payoff matrices.  Nash
equilibrium.  Evolutionarily Stable Strategy.  <p>-->

<li><b>Minority Game.</b>  Simple model of strategy, emergence of
spontaneous "cooperation."

<li><b>Tipping Model.</b>  Model of neighborhood segregation.  Strong
history dependence. <p>

<h3>Themes and Big Ideas</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Vocabulary.</b>  These various ideas are used, to varying
degrees, in many other fields.<p>

<li><b>Different styles of math/physics/computer science.</b>  <p>

<li><b>History Matters.</b> The world is more like an egg carton than a
salad bowl.  Tipping model.  <p>

<li><b>Universality.</b> Some features of dynamical systems are
universal. These features as quantitatively the same for lots of
different dynamical systems and can (and have) been measured
experimentally.  Examples: period-doubling in the logistic equation
and Mandlebrot set; parity-conserving and directed percolation in CA
transitions; percolation in CA epidemic model. <p>

<li><b>Politics of Simulation.</b>  Political assumptions are made
when forming models, and, arguably, certain modeling tools have a
political stance deeply embedded within them.  Examples:  Helmreich's
critique of Lansing and Kremer's work. <p>

<li><b>Interplay between order and disorder.</b><p>

<ol>
<li>Simple, deterministic systems can produce random
behavior. Example: logistic equation; three-body problem. <p>

<li>Complicated, large systems can have relatively simple
dynamics. Example: Random Boolean networks with K=2 have only sqrt(N)
attractors.  <p>

<li>Fractals can be produced by deterministic and stochastic
systems. Examples: making snowflakes via a deterministic rule;
flipping coins to build a Sierpinski triangle.<p> 
</ol>

<li><b>Models versus Reality.</b>  Modeling is fun; how, and to what
extent, do we connect models with reality?  Do we need to?
