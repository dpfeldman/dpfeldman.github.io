<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 28 September</b><p>  
<br>


<b>Not yet complete:  more to be added shortly</b>

<ol>


<li>Calculate the self-similarity dimension of the following objects.
Be sure to sketch the object and 

<a href="http://www.ukmail.org/~oswin/dimension.html">here</a> is a
nice discussion of self-similarity dimension that may prove
useful. And <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs312/2000fa/handouts/fractals.html">here</a>
is another nice page about self-similarity and dimension. 

<ol>

<li><a
href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/carpet/index.html">The
Sierpinski carpet</a>. 

<li> The Cantor middle-fifths set.  (I.e., at each stage of the
construction, remove the middle fifth of the unit interval.) 
<li> <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/Eureka/Plaza/4033/sierpinski_enver.html">
The Sierpinski Sponge</a>.

</ol>

<p>
<li><b>The Koch Curve:</b>  You can iteratively build the Koch Curve
by using the java applet found <a
href="http://www.arcytech.org/java/fractals/koch.shtml">here</a>.
Take the unit interval to be the zeroth generation.  
<ol>
<li>Write expressions for the number of segments and the total length
of the Koch curve at generation n. 
<li>Determine the self-similarity dimension of the Koch curve.
<li>In the limit that the generation n goes to infinity, what is the
total length of the Koch curve?
<li>Now consider the Koch curve as a function; the height of the curve
at a given x is f(x).  Is this function continuous?  Where is this
function differentiable?
<li>Suppose now that you started not with a line, but with an
equilateral triangle, and then built a snowflake.  I.e., the shape is
now a closed curve.  As a function of n, determine the perimeter and
the area of the snowflake.  What happens as n goes to infinity?
Discuss.  
</ol>


 
<p>
<li> Find a big map of the coast of Maine.  (There's a nice map
outside Craig Greene's office.)  Measure the length of the coast using
successively smaller "sticks" of length epsilon.  Use the relation
between total length and epsilon to estimate the box-counting
dimension.  Your estimate should also include an estimate of your
error.  <a

web site</a> might be helpful.(20 points)<p>



<li> <i>(This problem might get delayed a week; it depends how far we
get this week.) </i>  Write the following number in binary and ternary
(i.e., in base 2 and in base 3):
<ol>
  <li>15
  <li>81
  <li>.4
</ol>
<P>

<li>What do you think you might do your project on?  Write a few
paragraphs.  If you're undecided, you should write about things you're
considering, or non-math/physics things you might want to try applying
math to.
