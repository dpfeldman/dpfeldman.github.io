<b>You should complete these exercises by the beginning of our second
class, on Tuesday September 14</b>.  Feel free to work in pairs if you
wish.<p>

This isn't an official homework; there's no need for a fancy write-up.
But you should have some notes to hand in.  I'm not going to evaluate
this, I just want to see what you've found and check off that you did
it.  I expect that doing these will take around half an hour.<p>


For all these problems, you will probably want to use the program at
<a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html</a>.
If you prefer, you could use a spreadsheet program or a programmable
calculator or FORTRAN or an abacus.  <p>


All of the questions below concern the logistic equation, <b>f(x) =
rx(1-x)</b>.  You will explore what happens when you iterate of f(x), for
different values of the growth rate r.  <p>

<ol>
<li> Consider the following values for the parameter r:
  <ol>
  <li> r = 0.5
  <li> r = 1.5
  <li> r = 2.8
  <li> r = 3.2
  <li> r = 3.5
  <li> r = 3.55
  <li> r = 3.835
  <li> r = 4.00
  </ol>

  For each of the parameter values, observe what happens when you
  iterate f(x).  Consider only initial populations between 0 and 1.
  For each parameter value, you should:
  <ul>

<li> Determine the long-term behavior of the system.  What happens to
our mythical shark population?  For some parameter values you might
need to plot a few thousand orbits to see the final behavior. 
<li> Try a few different initial conditions for each parameter value.
Remember that your initial conditions should always be between 0 and
1.  You should find that overall behavior is independent of the
initial conditions you choose.
<li>For each parameter value, sketch the general shape of the
population as a function of time.  (There's no need to print out the
graph unless you really want to.)
</ul>
<p>


<li> Pick two other values of the parameter r, between 3 and 4.
Report on the long-term behavior of the orbits.

</ol>
