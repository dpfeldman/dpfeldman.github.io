<h1>Bifurcation Diagram: Initial Exploration</h1>

</center>
<br>
<br>

<b>You should complete these exercises by the beginning of our class
on Friday September 17</b>.  Feel free to work in pairs if you
wish.<p> 

As before, this is isn't an official homework; there's no need for a
fancy write-up. But you should have some notes to hand in.  I'm not
going to evaluate this, I just want to see what you've found and check
off that you did it.  I expect that doing these will take around half
an hour.<p> 


For all these problems, you will probably want to use the program at
<a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/bifurcation.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/bifurcation.html</a>.
This is the program I showed you in class. <p>
 

All of the questions below concern the logistic equation, <b>f(x) =
rx(1-x)</b>.  You will explore what happens when you iterate of f(x), for
different values of the growth rate r.  <p>

<ol>
  <li><b> Appreciation</b>: Make some bifurcation diagrams and admire
  them.  Zoom in in different areas.  What do you notice?<p>
  <!--<li><b>Period Doubling</b>: We saw in class that the long-term
  behavior jumps from period 2 to 4, and 4 to 8, etc.  Determine the r
  values at which these jumps occur.  Find at least a few significant
  digits.  Go out to at least period 16, but go farther if you can. <p>-->

  <li><b>Exploration</b>:  Find a parameter value for which the
  logistic map is period 5.  Find an r value for which the logistic
  map is chaotic.  Find an r value for which the logistic map has a
  period greater than 10. 

  </ol>
