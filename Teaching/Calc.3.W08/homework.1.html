<b>Introduction</b>
<ol>
<li>Please write me a short email in which you describe the math
classes you've taken before and why you're taking this class.  I'm not
looking for anything profound; I just want to get to know you a little
better and learn about what you're hoping to get out of the course. 
</ol>

<b>Chapter 12.2</b>
You can use Maple to check your work if you want.  But don't just
mindlessly plug the formulas into Maple.  Think about why the graphs
are shaped the way they are.

some googling, but be sure to cite your sources.
