<h2>Guidelines for Blog Assignments</h2>
<h4>Theory and Applications of Complex Networks</h4>
<h4>Fall 2008</h4>

<ol>

<li>David Easley and <a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/">Jon Kleinberg</a> 
set up a blog for their <a
href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/courses/info204/2008sp/">course
on networks</a> at Cornell University.  I would like to do something
similar for this class.  

<li>Over the course of the term you will write at least three blog
entries and post them on <a
href="http://betweenness.blogspot.com">betweenness</a>, the course
blog.  Due dates for posts will be staggered throughout the term.  I
will let you know via email when your posts are due.  

<li>Your posts should include a link to some online resource.  This
could be a newspaper article, magazine article, or a scientific
paper.  You should include a summary of the paper, including a
discussion of what you think is interesting or fun or important about
it.  You should also be sure to make clear how the online resource
relates to the themes and/or content of the course.  

<li>Your blog writing is a chance for you to further explore some of
the ideas of the course and draw connections to things that interest
you.  The blog is also a way for other students to learn about
interesting applications and extensions of what we're doing in the
course.  

<li>The main audience for your writing is other students in the
class.  A secondary audience is scientifically literate readers who
have some knowledge of networks but are not necessarily experts.  

<li>You should be aware that some people not in the course will almost
surely read your writing.  If you wish, you may write under a
pseudonym.  

<li>Your posts should be around 750 words.  The writing style should
be similar to that found in other academic or science blogs.

<li>In evaluating your blog posts, I will be looking for writing that
is clear and engaging, technically sound, written in an appropriate
style for an academic blog.  Don't just summarize your resource, add
something original to it with some commentary, critique, or analysis.  

<li>In addition to writing for the blog, you are expected to read the
blog regularly.  As part of this, you should also occasionally comment
on other posts.  These comments need not be lengthy.  Aim to make at
least one comment a week.
