\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework 05 which you
will find the WeBWorK page here:
\url{https://webwork-hosting.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es1056i-fall2023}
I recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the homework first.  This will
enable you to benefit WeBWorK's instant feedback before you do part
two.\\ 


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type this assignment.
\item If you like working on a tablet, go for it. 
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  around 60 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email 
  is challenging.)\\
\end{itemize}



\noindent The problems you should do are from {\bf Chapters 7, 8, and
