first one.

  \item Tastybites (\url{http://www.tastybite.com}) are tasty pouches
    of Indian or pan-asian food.  You are camping and your dinner will
    involve a tastybite entr\'ee.  You boil a litre of water, pour the
    water into a pot, put the pouch in the pot with the water, and put
    a lid on the pot.  You then proceed to make rice.  Estimate the
    temperature of food in the tastybite pouch when the rice is done.
    Be sure to state any simplifying assumptions you make.  (This is
    meant to be a simple specific heat problem.  Don't over think it.)
