<h3>Textbook</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">Deborah Hughes-Hallett, et al. <i>Calculus: Single Variable</i>,
   4th Edition. J. Wiley. November 2004. ISBN-10: 0471484822 ISBN-13:
   978-0471484820.  This is the <a
   href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Calc.1.F08/textbook.html">same book</a> we used in Calculus I.  I would like to cover portions of chapters 5-10.   
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>


<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 65 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Project:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 5 percent.
</ul>


<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 


<h3>Class Structure and Policies</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page. 

<li> Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on
  Friday. More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result
  in me mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade. 

<li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be very careful to not fall
  farther behind every week. 

<li> I will accept late homework assignments. However, I may not be
  able to grade these assignment thoroughly. This means they will be
  of significantly less use to you on exams. 

<li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
  no higher than a C. 

<li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
  also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends, and
  family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
  understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
  problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
  photocopy their solution and turn it in. 

<li> There will be one midterm exam, which will be open notes, open
  book, and (essentially) untimed. You may not, however, get any help
  from any humans during the exam. The midterm will include a few
  problems that you'll need to use Maple to do. 

<li> There will not be a final exam. Instead, students will do a small
  final <a href="./projects.html">project</a>. 
<li> In addition to me presenting ideas and examples, there will
  frequently be problems to work on in small groups in class. Use this
  time well -- it is a chance to try out some ideas and get on the
  right track before starting the homework. 
<li> You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
  functions, logs, and scientific notation. You do not need a graphing
  calculator for this course. 
<li> As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email, it is important that you check your email
  regularly. 
<li> Missing a few classes isn't a big deal. Please let me know
  beforehand if possible. 
<li> Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad. Any
  cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
  hearing; see the academic handbook for details. Possible
  consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion. 
<li> A more informal description of the course can be found <a
