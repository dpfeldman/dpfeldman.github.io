<h3>Official Description</h3><br>

<p class="no-box">Level: Intermediate.
Requirements: ES, QR.
Lab Fee: None.
Course Limit: 20.

<p class="no-box">
Thermodynamics is the area of physics concerned with the behavior of
very large collections of particles.  Examples include the water
molecules in glass of water, the electrons in a wire, or the photons
given off by a light bulb.   Thermodynamics studies properties of
collections of particles that are largely independent of the
particles' detail, for example, the tendency for heat to flow from a
hot object to a cold one.

<p class="no-box">
This course will begin with a treatment of the first law of
thermodynamics and basic thermal physics.  Topics to be covered
include the conservation of energy, heat and work, the ideal gas, the 
equipartition of energy, heat capacities, and latent heat.  We will
then move to the second law of thermodynamics, beginning with a
statistical definition of entropy.  This will require learning some
combinatorics (a mathematical technique for counting) and approximation
methods for working with very large numbers.  This statistical
approach will enable us to understand the origin of the second law of
thermodynamics, and will lead naturally to statistical definitions of
temperature, pressure, and chemical potential.  We will then turn our
attention to two broad areas of application.  The first of these is
heat engines and refrigerators, including heat pumps.  The second set of
applications involve free energy and chemical equilibrium.  Depending
on student interest, we will cover batteries and fuel cells, phase
transitions, adiabatic lapse rates in meteorology, and nitrogen
fixation.  Thermodynamics is a broadly applicable field of physics, and
so this course should be of relevance to students whose interests are
in almost any area of science or engineering, as well as those who
wish to gain a general introduction to a field that is one of the
pillars of modern physical science.

<p class="no-box">
Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets and a final research
paper, presentation, or lab project.

<p class="no-box">
Pre-requisites: Calculus II and either a college-level physics or
chemistry class.  




<h3>Informal Description</h3><br>
<ol>
<p class="no-box">

I've not taught this class before at COA.  Nevertheless, I have a
pretty good sense of how it will go.  Here are some thoughts on the
class and how to do well. 
<ol>
   <li>The weekly homework assignments for this class will be
   different than those in most of my other classes.  Rather than
   assigning 15-20 short problems, in this course a typical problem
   set may have four or five problems, most of which might involve
   multiple steps and/or require you to do some puzzling and
   cogitation. 
  
   <li>As such, it is more important than ever that you start the
   assignments early and seek help if you need it.

   <li> Students who take this class should be familiar with integral
   calculus and generally be comfortable working with algebra.  You
   should also have seen the conservation of energy and specific heat
   in either a chemistry or physics class.  If you think you might not
   have the background for this course, we should talk.

   <li> This class is a lot of work and will move at a fairly brisk
   pace. However, the workload is steady; you'll be doing
   approximately the same amount of work each week.

   <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
   confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
   sooner rather than later.  <!--You need to take responsibility to seek
   help if you need it. -->

  <li>There are no TAs for this class.  We will need to work
  together to make sure that people everyone can get sufficient help
  on the homework assignments. 
   
   <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
   don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
   first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest
   working with others, starting the assignments well before they are
   due, and seeking help if you need it.

   <li> I very strongly recommend getting your own copy of the
  textbook. I think you'll learn more if you have your own copy to
  take notes in and always have with you when you're doing
  problems. An important part of introductory science and math classes
  is forming a strong, long-term relationship with some textbooks.
  And I think the textbook we're using for this course is
  extraordinary. 

   <li>I expect the course to have three parts.
<ol>
    <li>Chapter 1.  This will be conservation of energy in various
    guises.  Most of this matieral will be new to you, but it will
    have a familiar feel.
    <li>Chapter 2-3.  Here we will encounter entropy and the second
    law of thermodynamics in various guises.  This material will be
    new, some of the math will be new, and it will be a bit abstract
    and big-picture.  
    <li>Chapter 4-5.  Here we will apply all the new stuff from
    chapters 2-3 to a wide array of phenomena.  This will be the most
    interesting, challenging, and perhaps the most rewarding part of
    the class.
