<h3>Basic Info</h3>
<p>
<b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave">Dave
  Feldman</a><br>   
<b>Office:</b> Second Floor of Turrets Annex<br>  
<b>Office Hours:</b> TBA and by appointment.<br>
<b>TAs:</b> Morgan Heckard and Aura Sliva<br>
<b>Help Session:</b> TBA<br>
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Homework Assignments:</b> 100 percent.
<!--<li><b>Mastery Quizzes:</b> 25 percent.-->
<!--<li><b>Lab Participation and Write-ups:</b> 10 percent.-->
<!--<li><b>Final Project:</b> 40 percent (split roughly equally between
  the presentation and technical report). -->
<!--<li><b>Final Reference Sheet:</b> 10 percent.-->
</ul>
<p>Most of these assignments will be problem sets where you will
  practice skills and techniques that we learn in class. Toward the
  end of the course there will likely also be some short case studies
  and longer problems. There may also be a final synthetic problem
  set and/or some short take-home quizzes.</p>


<p class="no-box">I usually recommend against grades; I believe they
  often interfere with genuine, reflective learning.  But I am happy
  to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of A's, B's,
  etc. </p>  


<h3>Class Structure and Policies</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page. 

<li>This is my sixth time teaching this class, but the first time I've
  taught it on my own. In the past I've team taught the class with
  Anna Demeo, and the course has had a significant project.  This
  version of the course is not project based. This will let us cover
  more material and go a bit deeper into some topics. 

<!--<li>During the first part of the course there will almost always be
  homework due at the beginning of class.  Every day.  Evaluation on
  these assignments will be based mostly on effort.  It is essential
  that you do these assignments.-->

<!--<li> During the first part of the course you will be taking a number
  of mastery quizzes.  These are short tests designed to make sure you
  have mastered key skills.  The mastery quizzes must be completed
  without the help of others, and ideally without notes.  You can
  re-take these quizzes if needed. -->

<li>This class will probably be quite large by COA standards. You and
  I will need to work together creatively to make sure that this
  classtime is comfortable and effective, and that outside of class
  people are able to get all the help they need. I have taught other
  classes with more than thirty students and it worked out fine. So
  I'm not worried. 

<li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
  confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
  sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can offer
  help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know who needs
  it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if you need
  it. On a related note ... 

<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
  with others and seeking help if you need it.  

<li>This class, especially at the beginning, will move fairly quickly
  and there will be a lot of work. This course is about building
  quantitative and analytical skills, and the only way to do this is
  through lots of practice. It is essential that you not fall behind.

<li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be very careful to not fall
  farther behind every week.

<li> I will accept late homework assignments. However, I may
  not grade these assignments thoroughly.  Multiple late
  assignments will result in a lowering of your grade and a mention in
  your narrative evaluation.

<!--<li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
  no higher than a C. -->

<li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
  also consult me, teaching assistants, other faculty, friends, and
  family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
  understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
  problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
  just copy their solution and turn it in. 

<!--<li> During the second part of the course there will be a significant
  emphasis on group projects.  You will be expected to fully
  participate in these projects and reserve Thursday afternoon lab
  time for group meetings during the second half of
  term. Presentations and final reports will be graded per group. To
  encourage sharing the significant workload, each student will
  complete a confidential peer appraisal reviewing each member's
  contribution to the group.   
-->
 
<li> As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email, it is important that you check your email
  regularly. 

<li> Unless we have made arrangements in advance, you are expected to 
  come to class and participate in discussion and group
  exercises.  
 
<li> Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad. Any
  cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
  hearing; see the academic handbook for details. Possible
  consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion. 


<!--<li>This is the fifth time we've taught the class, so we're fairly
  certain how it will go, but there are still some things we are
  experimenting with.  In particular, the system of mastery quizzes is
  new.  -->

<!--<li>It will take us a week or so to get to know you and figure out the  
  pace of the class.  There are always topics that we would like to
  spend more time on but can't.  -->

<li>Anna and I are in the very early stages of writing a book based on
  this class.  I will be writing as the term progresses and sharing
  updated drafts with you.  Although there will inevitably be some
  typos and omissions, I think this will be a useful resource for
  you.  Feedback and suggestions are welcome. 

<!--<li> This class is a lot of work.  It's very important to not fall
  behind.  Doing well on your project will require a significant time 
  investment.  Most of this work will occur weeks 5-10. -->

<li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
  technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
  There is also a temptation to get bogged down in debates about
  policy.  We should collectively resist these temptations; there are
  a lot of important topics to learn about. 

</ol>

<h3>What this Class Isn't</h3>
<p class="no-box">This course is not about the following things,
  although this course should help you do/think about the following
  things better and smarter. 
<ul>
  <li>Energy policy
  <li>Social impacts of energy technologies
  <li>Environmental impacts of energy technologies
  <li>Weatherproofing your house
  <li>Building your own wind turbine
  <li>An encyclopedic coverage of everything about energy
  <li>Climate change and global warming
