  <p>Computational text analysis (CTA) is an emerging field that uses
  computation to analyze texts. CTA draws on the fields of computer
  science, machine learning, computational linguistics, and literary
  theory. Using machine learning and statistics, computers can be used
  to explore how language is used in particular contexts, including
  how frequently different words are used, the sentiment of a
  word/text, as well as nuances in the ways words are associated with
  one another. We will use CTA to engage in "Distant Reading", a term
  coined by literary theorist Franco Moretti. Distant Reading stands
  in contrast to the more familiar "Close Reading": a deep engagement
  with a particular text or a passage from a text. Distant Reading
  engages not with a particular text, but with a large corpus of
  texts: e.g., all novels published in English in the 20th century,
  all articles written in The New York Times and The Washington Post
  in the last decade, or the lyrics of all top-100 pop songs from the
  1980s. Computational techniques applied to large collections of
  texts allow one to ask broad questions about structural and
  linguistic change over time and to look for patterns of language use
  that would not be evident from analysis of one or even several
  individual texts. Distant Reading, and computational text analysis
  more generally, is not intended to replace close reading, but to
  complement it. We will use CTA to explore how power structures and
  systems such as race, gender, and colonialism manifest themselves in
  bodies of text.</p>  
    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
<li>Stay physically and mentally healthy and maintain intellectual and
  personal connections and sense of community.</li>
<li>Engage together in an experimental, interdisciplinary, co-learning
  experience.</li> 
<li>Leave the class thinking differently about the relations between
  language and power, and how language and race/gender/coloniality
  make and re-make each other. </li>
<li>Have fun while learning a lot.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
    
<h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>Students (and instructors) who successfully complete this
    course will
    <ol>
  <li>Gain a conceptual understanding of various CTA techniques,
    including word frequency analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment
    analysis;</li>
  <li>Learn how to apply these techniques using pre-existing software
    and doing their own coding; </li>
  <li>Gain experience asking questions about power
    structures/systems---race, gender, colonialism---and how those structures
    manifest themselves in corpora of text; </li>
  <li>Learn how these questions of power can be explored using
    algorithmic methods; and</li>
  <li>Gain experience critiquing algorithmic methods through the
    lenses of race, gender, and colonialism.

    <p>The building in which we gather for this class, and all of College
      of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the Wabanaki
      people. The Native American tribes in Maine today include the
      Abenaki, Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important
      to acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the web
      of colonialism, past and present. <!--The future, however, is still
					    unwritten.--> </p>
