<h3>Course Structure and Pacing</h3>

<p>We haven't taught a class like this before, but have both wanted to
  for a long time. And now it's happening. We're really excited to
  co-create this class with you!</p>




<h3>Class Sessions</h3>
<p><ul>
    <li>This class meets twice a week: once for 1.5 hours and once for
      three hours. We will do a wide range of activities in class:
      discussions, hands-on activities, live coding, and computational
      explorations</li>
  </ul>
</p>




<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">Very Roughly...
  <ul>
    <li><b>Engagement in Class Discussions and Activities</b></li>
    <li><b>Short Reflection Assignments</b></li>
    <li><b>Short Computational Explorations and Exercises:</b></li>
    <li><b>Final Project</b></li>
  <!--<li><b>Lab Assignments:</b> 20 percent.</li>
  <li><b>Midterm:</b> 10 percent.</li>
  <li><b>Final:</b> 10 percent.</li>-->
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
  We do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.  In evaluating work, we're
  mainly looking for evidence of engagement. We'd like to talk more
  about my grading (non)philosophy, perhaps in week two, once the
  course is up and running.</p>

<p>We will discuss the scope and format(s) of the final project toward
  the middle of the term.</p>
  
  
<h3>Texts!</h3>
<p>There is no required text for this course. In a sense, anything and
  everythign is a text for this course.  :) </p>

<p>Throughout the class we will read and discuss a wide range of
  essays and articles, including popular essays and op-eds, literary
  theory, and scholarly articles.</p>



<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 4.5 hr/wk in class,
      3 hr/wk reading, 7.5 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
