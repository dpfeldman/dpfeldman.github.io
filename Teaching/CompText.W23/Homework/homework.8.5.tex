\noindent {\bf This assignment is not yet complete.  I will add one or
  two more problems shortly.} 

\begin{enumerate}

\item The distribution of survival times of a certain disease is well
  approximated by an exponential function.\footnote{I think this is
  actually a pretty reasonable assumption.}  By survival time I mean
  the number of months $t$ from diagnosis of the disease until death.
