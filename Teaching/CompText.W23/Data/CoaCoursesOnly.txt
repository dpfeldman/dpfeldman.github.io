AD 1019 Four-Dimensional Studio
ANDREWS, NANCY
This class gives students an opportunity to investigate
time-based art. 4-D art draws on the vast and varied
traditions of theatre, dance, media, and music, often
crossing boundaries to create hybrid works. This
course will focus on concepts and processes related
to representing and experiencing events that take
place in time. Strategies for planning, proposing, and
producing work individually or collaboratively will
be discussed and practiced. Some class periods will
be workshop in style, and include physical and vocal
exercises and improvisations. The course will include
basic instruction and use of video cameras and sound
recording devices. A majority of the learning in this
studio course will happen as students make projects
and reflect on their work and the work of others.
Documentation and information about contemporary
and historic time-based art will be presented.
Students will be evaluated based on imaginative
exploration of ideas and materials, extent and depth of
work processes and research, completion of assigned
projects, and participation in class discussions.
Level: Introductory. Lab Fee $30.00. Class limit: 12.

AD 1026 Introduction to Photography
WINER, JOSHUA
Photography is a common language spoken across
cultural, economic and geographical boundaries,
and used in news gathering, commerce and fine art.
Being able to use the camera as an effective tool for
self expression or in the pursuit of a documentary
project is a skill which is applicable to a large number
of COA students. A broad introduction to photography
and digital printing, this course will introduce the
principles and applied techniques of contemporary
photographic practices. Designed to put the student
in charge of their camera, we’ll begin with basic
camera controls such as aperture and shutter speed
and progress on to more advanced topics such as
the proper use of flash. Also covered will be an
introduction to Adobe Photoshop and/or Adobe
Lightroom as well as good printing practices in a
digital environment. Students will be evaluated on the
quality of finished prints included in a final portfolio,
their participation in class exercises and critiques, and
individual growth over the course of the term.

AD 1032 Introduction to Contemporary
Dance and Composition
ROBBINS, DANI
An introductory contemporary dance class with
focus on personal expression through movement
and compositional techniques. Beginning with an
awakening yoga warm-up, classes will explore the
body’s range of motion and exercise both long- and
short-term memory. Students will develop a basic
understanding of the craft of choreography, explore
various methods to create movement while gaining a
sense of their own aesthetic preferences. Over the 10week course, the group will collectively create a new
piece of choreography. Evaluation will be based on
demonstrated engagement with all course activities
and materials as well as successful completion of all
course assignments. Students of all levels welcome.

AD 1036 Figure Drawing
HILBERT, FRANCE
This course introduces students to the techniques,
methods, and history of the depiction of the human
figure through direct observational drawing. We will
be working from a live, nude model to investigate
structure, anatomy, and the expressive nature of
the human form through a variety of traditional
and contemporary approaches. Students will also
be trained to look at the figure abstractly through
careful consideration of negative space surrounding
the figure, siting parallel visual relationships across
the body, and by considering lines of gravity as a
horizontal and vertical axis for comparative analysis.
They will also develop a rudimentary understanding
of anatomy (artistically) through skeletal studies and
muscle groups while developing both traditional and
unconventional ways of seeing and drawing the figure.
Students will expand and refine their observational
skills, become proficient with a variety of drawing
media and understand how these concerns overlap
to create representational images. Understanding
the integration of formal elements of drawing and
how they are combined to achieve a sense of solidity,
proportion, gravity, and animation when representing
the human figure are our primary concern.
Evaluation will be based on active physical and verbal
participation in both work and in-class discussions
or critiques, an increased proficiency to accurately
represent the human form, individually designed
projects, and experimentation with drawing media.
A final digital portfolio of work and self-evaluation is
required.

Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: Permission of
instructor. Class limit: 12. Lab fee: $95. Meets the
following degree requirements: ADS

CAPERS, COLIN
Today, many use the words film and video
interchangeably. In fact, these words refer to different
mediums which evolved at different times, in different
circumstances, and whose languages and practices
originally developed around very different sets of
concerns and purposes. In what ways is the distinction
still useful in the digital age? This course will critically
interrogate the ways humans use moving images
to mediate our world, and the repercussions of
these uses on individuals, culture, and the contents/
subjects of the mediated messages. Many early video
artists sought to distinguish the medium from film in
that they wanted to create viewers who were active
participants rather than passive recipients. In this
class we will explore the political and self-expressive
impulses in video art, and trace its history from
1965—the year in which previously established artists
Andy Warhol and Nam June Paik first publically
exhibited video work—through to the current moment
when film is almost extinct and video has become
the world’s dominant moving image medium. We
will look at video art’s ties to performance art and
activism, and examine how many multi-media artists
have situated their use of video in the context of their
other practices. Artists whose work and writing about
their work will be explored include: Vito Acconci, John
Baldessari, Dara Birnbaum, Tony Conrad, Hermine
Freed, Joan Jonas, Miranda July, Mariko Mori, Bruce
Nauman, Pipilotti Rist, Bill Viola, and William Wegman.
We will also examine the role and work of artists’
collectives including Ant Farm, Broadside TV, Optic
Nerve, and Video Free America. Through secondary
sources we will look at the range of historical
methodologies and critical theories that have been
brought to bear on the works viewed. Evaluation will
be based on participation in class discussions and two
research papers. Students who come to class with
experience working in video will have the opportunity
to create their own original work in lieu of one of the
two papers.

AD 1051 Walking the Line: Introductory
Drawing
This course will introduce students to the
fundamentals of visual art in general and drawing,
in particular. While focusing on perception,
composition, line, and materiality, students will
draw from objects, the human figure, interior/
exterior spaces, and from imagined sources. We
will work with a variety of materials and challenge
the limits of scale by investigating the navigation
of landscapes as accumulative, drawn lines. We will
develop strategies to visualize histories, topographies,
individual perspectives, and inner worlds embedded
in landscape. Regular class critiques will assist in
developing evaluation skills of work in progress and
in analyzing formal composition principles. Assigned
readings and one research project, contextualizing
work and life of an assigned artist, will be a segment
of this course. Students will be expected to maintain

AD 1052 Cinematic Visions from
Marginalized Peoples
CAPERS, COLIN
Production modes, market concerns, and privilege of
access, in addition to the greater concerns of racism,
sexism, classism and other social biases, have all
historically contributed to the predominance of a
narrow range of cinematic voices being experienced
by most audiences. But from the dawn of cinema
there have been those working on the edges to realize
visions that speak to many modes of otherness and to
different manners of being, of belonging. In this class
we will investigate a range of diverse moving image
works and engage with texts that help contextualize
and elucidate the works and the creative impulses/
individuals behind them. The roster of movies viewed
this term will be chosen collaboratively from a curated
list by the group at the beginning of the term so as to
most effectively engage with the particular interests
of this configuration of students; choices include (but
are not limited to) films and videos made by and about
members of the following communities: LGBTQ+,
neurodiversity, seniors, economically disadvantaged,
homeless, people with disabilities, people of faith,
Inuit, Roma, Sami, Maya, Palawan, Amhara, African
diaspora, Indigenous peoples of the US and Australia.
Focus will be primarily on narrative forms, but some
works with experimental aspects may be featured.
Potential filmmakers include: Samira Makhmalbaf,
David Gulpilil, Cheryl Dunye, Tony Gatlif, Euzhan Palcy,
Haile Gerima, Mati Diop, Derek Jarman. Students
will be evaluated on their participation in class

discussions and on two papers written over the course
of the term. In these papers students will be asked
to demonstrate a balance between research into a
group of works of their choosing and exploration of
their own aesthetic and emotional responses to these
works.

and togetherness. This class will draw on a variety
of contemporary practitioners and methods, relying
on somatosensory feedback to access availability,
spaciousness, presence, and pleasure, both
individually and collectively. Students will investigate
basic patterns of choreography, experimenting with
principles of velocity and momentum, and exploring
personal and shared movement impulses. Assigned
readings, screenings, and writing assignments will
complement and support our physical practice.
Students will be evaluated based on attendance,
successful completion of assigned work, depth of
engagement during class and with course materials,

AD 1057 Performance and Ecology: What
Can Theater Do?
MENDEZ, KHRISTIAN E
Using Carl Lavery’s question for the performing
arts as a starting point, this course investigates
live performance’s historical and contemporary
engagement with ecological concerns. Our course
will begin by establishing a common language for
discussing theatre. We will then explore a range of
international performance, while learning about the
contexts (environmental, cultural, and institutional)
that influence their development, production,
and reception. We will focus our attention on the
interaction between narrative, embodied, and
material elements within these performances while
reading sections from texts in literary ecocriticism,
performance studies, theatre history, environmental
history, and anthropology. If in person, there will be
one fieldtrip mid-semester. Key questions will include:
How might the body of a performer complicate the
distinction between “environment” and “society?”
What are the means by which we can categorize a play
or a production as “ecological?” What are the specific
affective narratives embedded within environmentalist
discourse and how might performance interrupt or
complicate those? What might have performance
already done for the environment? Course goals are
to refine our skill set for analyzing the relationship
between scientific facts and narrative, a better sense
of the impact that live performance can have on
the various communities where it takes place, and a
sharper framework for engaging an audience with
questions regarding the “natural” world. Major works
will likely include: Manuela Infante’s Estado Vegetal;
the Rude Mechanicals’ Not Every Mountain; Rolling
Ryot’s Rainforest Reverb; Anne Washburn’s Mr.
Burns, a Post-Electric Play; Chantal Bilodeau’s Sila;
Grupo Sotzil’s Uk’u’x Ulew; William Shakespeare’s The
Tempest and The Winter’s Tale; Adam R. Burnett’s
Mammoth: A De-extinction Love Story; Animal Facts
Club’s Gulf of Maine; Art At Work MAINEUSA’s Blessing
of the Creatures; Shawna Dempsey & Lorri Millan’s
Lesbian National Parks and Services. Students will be
evaluated through eight weekly responses, a mid-term
performance-and-production analysis exercise, and a
final project of their choosing.
Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: Some interest
and/or previous coursework in art history, dramatic
literature, literature, performance analysis is
recommended but not required. Class limit: 12. Lab

AD 1058 Dissecting Popular Music
HENDERSON, JONATHAN
Can you trace the anatomy of a catchy song? How
does the form and structure of music compare
across culture and style? How does sound recording
dramatize a song on the sonic stage of headphones,
40

night club sound systems, and car stereos? This
practice-based course focuses on strengthening
critical listening and musicianship skills, as students
learn to dissect recorded performances of popular
music across divergent music genres. We will split
our time between the classroom and the rehearsal
studio, engaging in critical listening, discussion, and
hands-on musical performance. This course is open
to practiced musicians as well as beginners with an
interest in singing, instrumental performance, or
sound recording. In our weekly classroom sessions,
students will develop critical listening skills, including
hearing component parts of a sound mix (identifying
instruments, voices, and their placement in the
stereo field), identifying frequencies, recognizing
the use of processing effects, describing song form
and arrangement techniques, etc. Students will
work to articulate what they value about recorded
performances through written reflections and
presentations in class. In the rehearsal studio, we will
dissect the instrumental and vocal parts of several
pieces of music to understand how the components
conspire to create an overall effect. The class will also
experiment with group composition, working to write
a few pieces of music together towards the end of the
term. For a final project, students will create a short
podcast-essay that dissects a recorded performance
of their choosing. Evaluation will be based on class
participation, completion of written reflections, the
final project, and class presentations.

Students will be introduced to the visual language:
line, form, texture, value, color, and the understanding
of a solid mass in space. They will study individual
features in clay, learn the basics of the human
figure, proportions, anatomical structure, and how
it constitutes a whole. Students will be challenged
to make decisions as they work to express their
perspective and personal interpretation, culminating
in a life-size portrait in clay. This class will also involve
sketching from a live model, drawing the full forms,
learning about movement, volume, and composition.

AD 1060 Movement Training Basics

AD 1062 Architecture in the Expanded Field

BAKER, JODI

LOCK, TIMOTHY

This course is an introduction to a wide variety
of physical skills useful for anyone interested in
investigating their own potential for physical research
and self-expression. Techniques are derived from
movement training methodologies developed for
actors as well as other practices including (but not
limited to) classical ballet, martial arts, circus skills,
sports training, acrobatics, and improvisation.
Students gain a greater sense of physical awareness
and imaginative possibility, building strength, mental
and physical agility, stamina, and flexibility while
grappling with questions regarding personal and
collective responsibility, personal and collective
consen,t and the power/politics of a specific body in
a given space or circumstance. The class works to
challenge preconceptions about body image and body
language while working creatively and collaboratively
to clarify abstract concepts through physical action.
Evaluation is based on class participation (including
labs/screenings and small group rehearsals),
engagement with the course blog (including all
introduced topics and concepts), and successful
completion and presentation of a short sequence of
assigned projects. Students with any or no movement
experience are welcome.

Architecture, as an artistic pursuit within the context
of art history and theory, has occupied a unique niche
between the cultural, societal, and ecological context
driving our practical and physical reality. As they
grapple with these factors, the dominant modes of
theory within the discipline have shifted over time,
constantly changing architectural canon, style, form,
and tectonics in response. The past decade has seen
significant advances in technology and practices of
sustainability directly affecting architectural practice.
We are now faced with ecological and socioeconomic
crises that incremental improvements to the built
environments and ecologies cannot address. This
course seeks to reestablish a basis of architectural
design approach that synthesizes these challenges.
Through hands-on studio design problems, case
study presentations of precedent material, readings
in art and architectural literature and theory, and
site visits to realized architectural projects, this
course will provide a general introduction to the
practice of architectural design viewed through
the lens of historic artistic response to societal,
ecological, and cultural needs. Students will develop
a base understanding of the discipline, while being
introduced to architectural representation techniques
and the tools used for architectural design and to
assess building performance. In doing so, we will
center our work around four key design factors
actively changing the built environment and practice:
context, function, performance, and identity. Students
will be evaluated based on class participation, timely
submission of accomplished projects, and their artist
presentation.

AD 1061 Sourcing the Body: Experiential
Anatomy
ROBBINS, DANI
In this course, we will work towards an embodied
understanding of our own anatomy, as well as
a deepened sense of listening, presence, and
understanding of the body as a complex system.
Students will explore anatomical models and be
led through simple, gentle movement sequences.
These exercises will be drawn from various somatic
modalities such as Mind-Body Centering, Feldenkrais
Technique, and Alexander Technique. Students will
be asked to reflect on these explorations in a journal
format, and will curate a small portion of this work
to share with the class on a weekly basis. Readings,
additional viewings, and drawing assignments will
complement our weekly lessons. This course is
recommended for performers looking to deepen their
relationship to their instrument, as well as students
with a strong science background who are interested
in additional perspectives on anatomical study.
Through consistent discussion of this work and our
experiences in it, we will work to place the experiential
in dialogue with the empirical.

AD 1063 The History of Making Prints
EARLEY, ANNIKA LOUISE
In this seminar, we will cover the history of
printmaking. Rather than take a chronological
approach to print history, the seminar examines
four broad themes surrounding historical and
contemporary printmaking: prints and politics;
printmaking as a process; the appropriated image; and
collaboration/participation. These themes encompass
a breadth of artists, works, and time periods. The
ideas presented and discussed in this seminar provide
a context and a ground for the student to more clearly
define their own creative practice and relationship
to the history of printed art forms. Readings, writing
assignments, and at-home projects challenge
students to critically position themselves, as well as
the practice of print in general, within the broader
scope of visual culture. It also assists in developing a
habit of research, and understanding that it can be an
essential part of the creative process. Assessment will

AD 1065 Contemporary Dance Composition
ROBBINS, DANI
This introductory course will focus on personal
expression through movement and compositional
techniques. Each class will begin with a gentle
warm up that will help students become aware of
movement impulses and locate a personal movement
vocabulary. Through short, weekly assignments,
students will gather a collection of tools for
composing movement sequences including honing
improvisation toward set choreography, responding
to spatial and environmental conditions, and drawing
inspiration from sound and imagery. Our making
will be supplemented by readings and screenings of
20th and 21st century choreographers, aiding us in
contextualizing our creative process within the current
field of contemporary dance. Students will be asked to
craft a short final piece of choreography, to be shared
with the community during a works-in-progress
showing. Evaluation will be based on attendance,
satisfactory completion of weekly assignments, and
rigorous engagement with the process of developing
a final piece. Students of diverse abilities and
experiences are encouraged to enroll. It is strongly
recommended that students have some prior dance or
theater coursework before taking this course. Please
contact the instructor directly if you have questions
about your background.

AD 2011 Graphic Design Studio I: Visual
Communication
COLBERT, DRU
Visual communication is one of the most pervasive
means of human communication. Graphic design,
within the realm of visual communication, is a process
used to effectively convey ideas and information
visually through print, electronic media, products in
the marketplace, and structural elements in the built
environment. Its application may be promotional,
editorial, informational, expositional, or instigational.
It may cater to, or critique commercialism, colonialism,
capitalism, and advertising—or alternately be used to
organize information and visualize complex data or
concepts. Is it possible to construct a visual message
that will be received through the din and noise of our
overstuffed media environment, past other competing
messages? What are some of the contemporary issues
surrounding design and the roles and responsibilities
of graphic designers in the workplace and in their
communities?
In this introductory/intermediate-level studio course
you will become familiar with visual rhetoric and the
basic elements, principles, and processes of graphic
design that will help you to construct effective visual
messages. You will work on a variety of conceptual
visual communication projects in the realms of
information design, editorial design, and promotional
design. Lectures, demonstrations, assignments,
and critiques will offer a balanced framework for
developing skills in creative perception, critical
thinking, and visual communication. An emphasis
is placed on these elements and evaluation will be
weighted more heavily in these areas than technical
expertise on the computer. You will, however, be
required to learn the basics of several computer

required to visualize your ideas.

totems, pictorial painting, to sequential engraved
prints, comic books, graphic novels, graffiti, and the
web. In this studio course, students will investigate
visual language, symbolism, and some of the pictorial
devices, materials, and techniques employed by artists
to tell stories visually—particularly through sequential
composition in the graphic arts.

Through focused assignments, discussion of
artists’ works (historic and across cultures), and
guided demonstrations in a variety of materials
and techniques, students will respond to select
historic forms of visual narrative to create unique
contemporary forms in which to tell their own relevant
stories. Case study studio projects will be selected
to focus on key points in world history that mark
technological transition in material, technique, and
pictorial devices employed by artists to render visual
narratives. Projects will range from the hands-on
exploration of ancient wall painting and low relief
carving technique, through non-press printing
techniques such as linocut, image transfer, and
potato prints, to collage of found images, xerography,
Polaroid print manipulation, digital prints, and
“synthetic” imaging on the computer. Students will
be encouraged to explore and invent new forms of
sequential composition and utilize new or previously
unexplored materials or techniques. Concurrent
investigations in visual studies will focus on the
meaning created through the use of pictorial devices,
signs and symbols, and the creation of narrative
structure through repeated image/duplication,
sequential composition, and visual allegory. Students
will be evaluated on writing assignments, level
of completion and analysis of assigned readings,
research and presentation, quality and completion
of projects, and participation in class activities and
discussion. There are no prerequisites, however,
the following courses are recommended: Intro to
Arts and Design, or 2D courses in drawing, painting,
printmaking, or graphic design, photography, or
writing and/or literature courses.

AD 2012 3D Studio: Introduction to ThreeDimensional Art and Design
COLBERT, DRU
This course is an introduction to three-dimensional
design and sculpture. Through a variety of projects
students will analyze and apply the classic organizing
principles of three-dimensional design work. Elements
of form, space, line, texture, light, color, scale,
and time (including sound, sensory perceptions,
movement and natural processes) will be explored—
with attention paid to how a work functions, involves a
viewer, activates a space, or impacts an environment,
physically, psychically, or socially. Projects in the
class will progress from the creation of objects to
investigations of the sensory and objective aspects
of space. Students will experiment with subtractive
and constructive processes using traditional as well
as contemporary materials such as found, recycled,
and natural objects. A diverse range of materials and
techniques will be introduced and demonstrated.
Discussion of historic and contemporary artists’ work
will augment the course. Students will be evaluated
based on completion of projects, participation in class
discussions, and individual/group critiques.

to tell stories about far ranging topics—the unknown,
the success of a hunt, gods and goddesses, historical
events, wars, court tales, biblical themes, social
instruction, morals, politics, product promotion,
and personal imaginings. Historically, artists have

AD 2017 Drawing Mineral and Botanical
Matter in the Forest of Maine
CLINGER, CATHERINE
Viewed as a regular practice, the descriptive power of
drawing can intensify the experience of observational
fieldwork, provide the draughtsperson with a richer
understanding of the cycles within a landscape, and
deepen our relationship with the natural world. The
primary setting for this studio course is Mount Desert
Island. The subject matter of our visual attention
includes trees, rock features, and other indigenous
plant life of the island. Students will learn a variety
of drawing methods in order to document the natural
history of a specific place. Coursework includes:
maintaining a field sketchbook, graphically recording
the development of a singular botanical life form over
the course of the term, and producing visual notations
in the sketchbook during a bi-weekly slide lecture on
the history of artistic representations of the natural
world. Evaluation is based on class participation,
evidence of completion of weekly assignments, and
final project.

AD 2020 History of Photography
WINER, JOSHUA
This introductory course charts the history of
photography from early 19th century nascent
technologies (daguerreotypes and tintypes) through
to the diverse range of photographic media currently
practiced by contemporary artists and photographers
(film and digital). In this art history course, we will
consider how the new visual discourse of photography
was informed by both technological and social
44

developments. Photography cannot be defined as a
unified medium; therefore, this course investigates
both discontinuous as well as coalesced conventions
within its own history; in other words, how and
why photographs look different from each other.
In addition to noting external influences upon the
photographic object, we will explore how photography
helped to shape a variety of visual disciplines from
painting to zines. Accordingly, our class will discuss
formal photographic syntax (how they are composed
and the forms they appear represent) and allied
aesthetic practices as well as the wider social and
political issues that influenced the content of its visual
culture. We will study how artists use photographic
practices in the context of social and activist functions
to examine a diversity of subjects—gender and class,
and ethnic and national identity, among others—and
how categorical distinctions between mass culture
and avant-garde art, and commercial and fine art
photography are not always stable. Course readings
include writings by historians, artists, and critics
that reflect the unstable status of the photographic
object within the intersections of science, technology
and culture, aesthetic discourse, and everyday
documentation. We will look at many photographs.
Students will be evaluated on their participation in
class discussions, short essay assignments, and a final
project or paper.

AD 2022 Film Theory
CAPERS, COLIN
How do motion pictures express ideas? Why do we
respond to them in the ways we do? Film theorists
have approached these questions from contexts as
diverse as formal composition (sound, mise-en-scene,
color, cinematography, and editing), signs and symbols
(semiotics), cultural and/or gender concerns, and
psychoanalysis. In this class, we will practice using
these and other theories to understand and analyze
moving pictures. Each week we will screen one or two
feature length movies as well as a number of short
films. Screenings will be complemented by source
texts from critics, theorists, artists/filmmakers, and
cinephiles. Students may choose to take this course
as writing intensive; those who do will be required
to write and revise three or four critical response
essays based in analytical frameworks covered in
the course. All students will be required to complete
a final research paper and presentation. Students
should expect to spend 7-9 hours a week in class
meetings, labs and screenings (in addition to writing
and research). Students will be evaluated on papers,
final project, and participation in discussions. Writing

AD 2029 Contemporary Artist as
Researcher and Activist
CLINGER, CATHERINE
The student will be introduced to a contemporary
stream of visual culture that places nature, ethos,
competing ideologies, and our relationship to
these within the context of emergent forms of art
activism. In response to environmental and social
crisis, theory and praxis figure significantly in the
work of artists and artist collectives from around
the globe whose practice manifests as socially
engaged art as defined by Pablo Helguera; data/
information reimagined as by Mona Hatoum and
Trevor Paglen; or examinations of reconciliation and
mass trauma in the work of Doris Salcedo and Kara
Walker. In some cases, artworks engage with nature/
culture by their placement in site-specific locations,
through new modes of picturing, and/or through the
appropriation of hypothetical scientific musings or
emerging technologies (e.g., Ed Atkins, fictionalized
genetic hybridization and subversion of surveillance
tools). Many of the artists we examine make use of
new tools designed for industrial purpose, medical,
agricultural, or scientific research. Others further
participatory dialogues within antiracist, decolonizing,
and queer-centred discursive practices. This work is
inherently transdisciplinary and human ecological in
disposition and character. Many of these producerartists appropriate the role of researcher in order to
bring attention to ecologies that human beings have
disrupted or will disrupt. Doris Salcedo, Tacita Dean,
Kara Walker, Mark Dion, Shirin Neshat, Ai Weiwei,
Andra Ursuta, Karim Ben Khelifa, Raven Chacon,
Frances Alys, Natalie Jeremijenko, Guillermo Galindo,
among others, will be considered. Evaluation is

AD 2035 Our Band Could Be Your Life:
Music, Art, Zines 1975-2015
MAHONEY, DANIEL
This course is an investigation of how we consume
and are consumed by music. Topics include youth
and subcultures of music, power and identity, the
politics of location, and fan cultures. We will listen to
punk rock, hip hop, riot grrrl, shoegaze, noise, psych,
death metal, doom drone, post rock, grindcore, and
pop (among others); we will analyze visual artists
who come to represent musical movements (such as

Raymond Pettibon & Winston Smith, Fab 5 Freddy &
Cey Adams) and we will read socio-cultural criticism of
the times and places from which these artists sprang
(Joan Didion, Steve Waksman, Theodor Adorno, Tobi
Vale, Kathleen Hanna, and Kevin Young). The class will
explore analogue artifacts from the 70s, 80s, & 90s
(posters, zines, fine art, videos) and compare them to
digital artifacts found today on the internet. Students
are required to attend all weekly film screenings and
sound sessions. Evaluations will be based on regular
critical responses, a final project, and participation in
discussion and class activities.

AD 2036 Critical Making and New Media Art
KARRIEM, QURAN
This is a course for critically engaging with technology
through making and theory. Starting from Marshall
McLuhan’s seminal analysis of the ways media
configure the human sensorium, we will build
on sound and moving image to explore the ways
computation operates on levels above or beyond
human perception. We will draw from new media art,
politics, and media theory to engage with technology
by focusing on computation as media, medium, and
material for artistic production and critique. Through
readings, in-class projects, and semester-long critical
making projects, we will engage with the history
and practice of critical making with a focus on the
production of generative new media projects using
the software program Max/MSP. Beginning with an
overview of media theoretical concepts like mediation,
representation, image, embodiment and information,
the course will focus on discourses relevant to new
media practice today, including algorithms, race,
platforms, and artificial intelligence. The aim of this
course is to develop a critical technical practice that
takes seriously the politics embedded within our
contemporary media systems by focusing on the ways
computation is interwoven into everyday experience.

solution to a problem. A documentary may function
in the realm of art. Documentaries may compile
images from archival sources, interview testimonies
about social movements or events, record an ongoing
event as it happens, or synthesize these and other
techniques. We will look at various documentaries
both historic and contemporary, and a number

sound. The course will culminate in a performance
to the community of student presentations that
expresses the wide use of sound as part of our
culture. Evaluation will be based on class participation
and a set of assignments, including a final project.
Emphasis will be placed on an artistic interpretation
of soundscape, although students will be expected to
have a basic understanding of the scientific basis of
acoustic phenomena.

AD 3013 Animation

AD 3015 Art of the Puppet

ANDREWS, NANCY

ANDREWS, NANCY

This course explores animation as a form of creative
expression, experimentation and personal vision.
Various techniques, such as drawing, cut-out,
painting on film, and under-the-camera collage, will
be introduced. Students will create flip books, video
pencil tests and animated films. Students will be
given exercises and assignments that guide them
through processes for making art. Various artists’
animated films will be screened and discussed.
History and concepts related to animation and film
will be introduced through screenings, readings, and
discussions.

Puppetry is the art of designing, constructing, and
operating puppets, usually for an audience. A puppet
is an articulated figure controlled by external means.
Puppets have been used for entertainment, education,
therapy, spectacles and social/political demonstration.
This course will explore the construction and use of
puppets, investigate the theory, history and practice
of puppetry, and seek out the role and potential of
puppets. Various types of puppets will be made,
including hand puppets, rod puppets, shadow puppets,
and large scale puppets. Students, individually and in
collaboration, will create both original and adapted
scripts and scenarios for their puppets, exploring
relationships between text, story, character, and
movement of the puppet. In addition to live work,
students may choose to develop puppets for use
within film, video, or multimedia projects. The
course will include readings on puppetry, screenings,
presentations, demonstrations, and group discussions.
Students will be evaluated on 1) participation in
class discussions and exercises, 2) quality and effort
demonstrated through projects/presentations and, 3)
understanding and study of readings and screenings
as demonstrated in discussions and projects.

AD 3014 Soundscape
ANDREWS, NANCY; TODD, SEAN
Soundscape may be defined as an environment of
sound (or sonic environment) with emphasis on the
way it is perceived and understood by the individual,
or by a society. It thus depends upon the relationship
between the individual and any such environment.
The term may refer to actual environments, or to
abstract constructions such as musical compositions
and tape montages, particularly when considered
as an artificial environment. In this interdisciplinary
course we investigate a broad range of acoustic
concepts, ranging from a scientific treatment of
the nature and behavior of sound both in air and
underwater, the biology of hearing, the use of sound
by animals in communication, and the cultural
applications of sound and music in human society.
Students will explore methods of composition using
sounds as materials for assigned projects. Various
approaches to understanding and experiencing
sound will be examined, including spoken word,

AD 3017 Dramatic Writing for Stage and
Screen
LEPICO, ANDREA
This is an intermediate creative writing course for
students interested in writing for theater, film and
television. We will read published and unpublished
COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

plays, screenplays and tv shows from up-and-coming
writers currently off and on Broadway and in film/
television, as well as selected plays and screenplays/
shows from the cannon based on student interest.
Playwrights (and screenwriters), like cartwrights
and shipwrights, are all skilled builders of vehicles
meant to move people from one place to another. We
will explore dramatic structure from the perspective
of the audience. Whether writing linear narratives,
collage or non-linear plays and films, there is a rhythm
to dramatic writing that can be studied. We will make
a conscious study of form to free us to write what we
are driven to write. Through reading, analysis, and
writing, we will investigate the dramatic elements of
character, conflict, language, and theme. The course
will include practical writing exercises to motivate and
progress the writing from first draft through revision
to rehearsal draft. Students will be encouraged to
develop productive writer habits and self-discipline.
Class time will be divided between hearing students’
work and discussing work we’ve read. We will develop
our listening skills when hearing our own and
colleagues’ work. We will explore the role of critique
in new script development and refine a process that
works for us. Students will be expected to bring new
pages in to each class building to a complete first draft
of a full-length play or screenplay (of any length) by
the end of the course. Evaluation will be based on the
student’s dedication to developing a writing practice
as well as the submitted script. We will conclude with
a reading series to give each student the opportunity
to hear their work in front of an invited audience.
Evaluation is based on the quality of student’s written
work and participation in class discussion.

AD 3018 History of Filmmaking II
(1946-Present)
CAPERS, COLIN
D. W. Griffith, pioneer of early cinema, prophesied
in 1924 that by 2024 cinema would have been
instrumental in, “eliminating from the face of the
civilized world all armed conflict.” Where have things
gone wrong? Cinema is a powerful medium that in
many ways is still struggling to find its place among
the other arts; there are many promising byways that
have been overlooked or under-explored. This course
explores the histories, production and meanings of
motion pictures. Using various films as case studies,
we will look at the development of film forms,
techniques, and genres from 1946 to the present—
the second half of cinema history. Films studied
will include examples of narrative, documentary,
animation, and the avant-garde. Students will learn
concepts of film analysis and criticism, and will
have opportunities to practice critical skills in class
discussions and in research and writing assignments.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation

in class discussion, written papers, and research
presentations. Film gives us the opportunity to, in the
words of David Lynch, “get lost in another world...
to dream in the dark.” Who decides which dreams we
will see? Through an understanding of where cinema
has been we can more effectively shape its, and our,
future. Writing Focus option.

the US. Students will read plays and study a variety
of artists that have used theatre as a viable force
for change over the last century. Together we’ll
explore the mechanics and dynamics of particular
performances as well as the cultural context in which
these works were conceived. We will investigate
significant periods in American history such as
the New Deal, the House Un-American Activities
Committee, the Civil Rights Movement, the emergence
of the AIDS epidemic, the attack on the World Trade
Center, and the economic crash of 2007-08—and
we will explore the impact of these events on
this particular form. Research will include Circuit

new source material, new production methods and
concepts, students may receive credit for this course
multiple times. Students research, rehearse, and
produce a performance for the public in collaboration
with a faculty director. The material and pedagogical
focus of the course changes with each successive
rendition. The number of students enrolled in the

the project. Students with any or no experience in
theater are welcome but priority is based on seniority
and/or specific academic investment in the given
project, process, or subject matter. In most cases, all
assignments (cast and crew) will be made the previous
term, through auditions and interviews. Those
interested in non-actor aspects of production (set
design, light and sound design, stage management,
dramaturgy, etc.) are especially encouraged. The
course meets four days a week and those enrolled
must be available for a certain amount of additional
collaborative work outside class time (extra
rehearsals, construction and tech work, plus final
performance dates and strike). A production schedule
will be available by week one. Evaluation is based on
demonstrated commitment to the process as well as a
final reflective paper based on the experience. Default

styles from salsa to hip-hop, funk, reggae and more.
We will explore the intersecting work of artists
(such as Janelle Monae, Angélique Kidjo, Fela Kuti,
Lee “Scratch” Perry, and Bob Marley) and scholars
(such as Paul Gilroy, Angela Davis, Amiri Baraka, and
Michael Veal). Equal weight in the course will be given
to reading, listening, and writing as valuable modes
of interacting with music. Throughout the course of
the term, students will learn to listen more closely to
sound and to develop a critical capacity for relating
these sounds to the political and social worlds from
which they emerge. Turning our attention back and
forth between the local and the transnational, Black
Atlantic Music is a window into how music takes shape
in the context of culture, politics, geography and
history. Evaluations will be based on regular written

AD 3032 Intermediate Ceramics

AD 3078 Native American Drama

MANN, ROCKY

MENDEZ, KHRISTIAN E

This is a ceramics course for students with
intermediate levels of skill. This course will focus on
hand building, clay slab construction, and advanced
throwing techniques. A basic level of skill on the
potters wheel is required. Glazing and decorating
processes, alternative firing techniques, and ceramic
technology will be introduced, as well as artistic
concepts and design principles relevant to artistic
expression in the ceramic medium. Historical
and contemporary ceramic works and artists will
be studied. Students will be evaluated on class
attendance, participation, completion of assignments,
and sketch book entries.

This course will be a fast and broad exploration of
the presentation of Native American identities and
communities through performance. We will study
a series of representations of indigeneity through
embodied performance on stage and in public spaces.
Our analytical frameworks will be dramatic theory,
performance studies, and Native theatre studies.
This course will better equip students to understand
how manipulating the image of the “Indian” through
performance contributes to, resists, and complicates
colonial erasure and the settler logic. The geographic
scope of the course is focused on Native American
communities within the United States, but we
will occasionally draw from artists based in other
territories. Key questions we will engage with are:
by what means have Native American communities
been represented and performed in US history? What
does it mean to represent ourselves and others? What
circumstances do artists, activists, and scholars need
to consider when making and analyzing performance
in the aftermath of colonialism? What are the ties
between artistic self-representation by Native and
Indigenous peoples and larger political movements
towards self-determination? What might the study of
US Native American drama enrich our understanding
of contemporary American society? Artists and
artworks studied may include: Spiderwoman Theater’s
Sun, Moon and Feather, Reverb -ber-ber-ations;
Muriel Miguel’s (Kuna Rappahannock)’s Hot’n’Soft;
Mary Kathryn Nagle’s (Cherokee) Manahatta; Larissa

AD 3079 Jazz Manouche
HENDERSON, JONATHAN
During the 1930s, the French-Romani guitarist Django
Reinhardt launched a new musical style. Combining
the traditional music of his Romani heritage with
French bal-musettes and the swing music storming
Europe from the other side of the Atlantic, Reinhardt
pioneered a sound that came to be known as “gypsy
jazz,” “jazz Manouche” or “hot club jazz.” This class
will focus on the rich musical repertoire flowing from
this history as we work to practice, perform, and
learn about its sounds and histories. A practice-based
course organized around learning and performing
the music, it will treat a series of compositions
as entry points for lessons in jazz improvisation,
understanding harmonic motion, chord voicing, and
rhythmic awareness (swing, waltz, bossa, bolero,
etc.). In addition to practice-based work, students
will also learn about the histories of Romani (Sinti)
migration across Europe and the genealogies of
musicians as they relate to the development of jazz
Manouche. Students will read texts concerning Django
Reinhardt and other key figures and will write a final
paper that reflects research into the people, places,
and sounds associated with this music. Assessment
will be based on class participation, weekly practice
logs, and the final paper/project. The course is
designed for students with a working knowledge of an
acoustic instrument (guitar, strings, bass, percussion,
accordion, mandolin, woodwinds, brass, percussion,
etc.). The class will be held largely outdoors, so we
cannot accommodate piano or electric instruments.

AD 3080 Intermediate Projects in
Photography
WINER, JOSHUA
In this intermediate level course, students will explore
at least three distinct working methods for making
a small body of work. Through demonstrations
and subsequent linked assignments, students will
explore the figure and portrait, still life tabletop,
and one other topic to be decided by the group.
After completing the three modules, students will
have time to complete a final project in the style
and method of their choosing. Critiques, readings,
and research will help build a visual and intellectual
vocabulary to explain and explore these personal
projects. The primary goal of this course is for each
student to make a meaningful body of work in their
own style that could be ready to hang in a gallery. We
will be spending considerable time in class editing
and printing. Students should expect to spend
considerable time outside of class making pictures.
Self-motivation, the ability to collaborate on an idea
or image, and being on time will all be expected. Some
prior experience with Adobe Lightroom Classic or
Photoshop is highly recommended. Students will be
evaluated on their progress towards their goals, and
participation in discussions and critiques; pass/fail
grade encouraged. In order to register for this course,
students must have previously taken Introduction to

AD 4013 Activating Spaces: Installation Art
COLBERT, DRU
“Space in active dialogue with the things and people it
contains...” — RoseLee Golberg, from Space as Praxis.
Installation art is one of the most original, vigorous,
and fertile forms of contemporary art. It often
involves working in specific non-art sites where
the activation of the place, or context, of artistic
intervention is concerned not only with art and its
boundaries, but also with the fusion of art and life.
Installation art extends the area of practice from the
studio to public space. Architects, urban planners,
and environmental designers consider similar formal
and social aspects of space in the creation of city
plans, buildings, and public spaces. Through hands-on
projects and a survey of historic and contemporary
art and design work, this intermediate level 3D studio
course offers an opportunity to explore formal
aspects and social contexts of space and time as a
medium for making art.
Students will create interior and exterior installations
that may incorporate sculptural elements, everyday
objects, light, sound, or other devices. Course work
will investigate the objective and subjective qualities
of space, material, and form, and the meanings
created through their juxtaposition. In addition to
studio work, we will survey a variety of historic and
contemporary contextual art works including: spaces
laid out by architects and designers, installation
itself as an art form, public art projects, sacred
spaces, the work of visionary artists, historic sites,
and monuments. Students will be evaluated on their
participation in class activities and critiques, their
timely completion of projects, and attendance.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites: 3D
studio classes in art, architecture, environmental
design, performance art, or signature of instructor.

AD 4014 Graphic Design Studio II: Digital
Projects
COLBERT, DRU
This studio course offers students an opportunity for
in-depth study of contemporary issues, applications
and techniques in graphic design. Students will
pursue conceptual problem solving through creative
exercises and theoretical and applied studio projects.
50

Particular emphasis will be placed on advancing skills
in creative problem-solving, typography, layout, image
generation and preparing art for print. Digital and
hands-on methods (techniques such as block print) for
image generation will be explored to create original
illustrations. Projects will include typography and
illustration exercises, identity design, environmental
design and interpretive information design. Students
will be encouraged to solicit a design project from
the local community and produce it in the context of
the class by engaging in the creative process from
concept to production oversight during the course
of the 10-week term. In addition to structured class
assignments, students will have an opportunity to
propose and pursue their own design projects. This
class will be conducted in seminar/studio format.
Emphasis will be placed on the design process—from
creation to production, the timely completion of
project phases, creative solutions, and advancing
skill in typography, layout, and image generation. The
detailed schedule will depend largely on the course
makeup and individual project proposals.

AD 4016 The Wilderness in Landscape Art I:
Proto-Ecological Visions
CLINGER, CATHERINE
This course is concerned with the visualization
of what is wild in the landscape and how artists
pictured that which others saw as untamed. Course
readings will engage with a variety of texts written
by art historians, geographers, historians, writers,
and theoreticians that address the invention of the
modern idea of wilderness. Assumptions governing
what constitutes wilderness and how artists have
shaped our perception of it are among topics which
we will consider. Landscapes contain life that seems
to fluctuate between haggard or feral states of
nature. We will investigate how an artist distinguishes
between that which is cultivated and that which is
natural; what images evoke nostalgia for a lost past
or suggest the preference for a human dominance
over those origins we have isolated ourselves from.
Students will examine visual evidence in the fine arts
that indicates a growing awareness of the effect of
the Industrial Revolution in North America and in
Europe. Although we look at ecologies through the
eyes of artists, students interested in science, history,
and literature are encouraged to take the course.
Evaluation will be based on a research paper and class
presentation. There will be a class trip to view art and/
or sites relevant to our discussion.

AD 4019 Studio Printmaking
CLINGER, CATHERINE
Printmaking is the process of transferring an image
from one surface to another. A print mirrors the
surface whence it came and also performs as a
reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of
objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in
any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful
collaboration with materials in order to realize the
potential of form as a means of expression. This studio
course will explore ways to address this aesthetic
challenge through printmaking. Students will acquire
basic skills as printmakers with an emphasis on relief
(woodcut and linocut) and intaglio (line etching,
engraving and aquatint) techniques. They will also
develop a broad understanding of the history of
prints and how they have functioned to communicate,
document, and transmit information through images
on paper. Students will be evaluated on their projects,
participation in critiques, level of engagement with
materials, ability to work in a collaborative studio, and
final project.

AD 4020 Object and Performance
BAKER, JODI; ANDREWS, NANCY
Objects have long been significant elements in
ritual, dance, theatre and performance art; they
might be props, body extensions, idols, and avatars.
Taught in a workshop format, this course will
explore a variety of techniques from traditional

theatre arts, as well as sculptural ideas that can be
integrated into performance. Goals will be to gain a
deeper understanding of the power of objects in a
performative context; to experiment with a variety
of building techniques; to practice, create and
refine personal and found objects as art; to explore
an object’s potential to spark narrative, illustrate
relationship dynamics, and fuel theatrical action.
We’ll also study the use of objects in connection with
certain forms of performance training and creative
collaboration strategies. The course will provide an
historic context of objects in performance and will
utilize improvisational exercises, personal writing,
movement, and bodywork. Class topics may include:
relationship, scale, sound, duration, repetition,
archetype, and viewer participation/performance.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation
in all group projects, in-class assignments and
discussions, demonstrated understanding and
mastery of basic skills through the creation of
projects, timely completion of all assignments and
readings, and effective participation in class critiques.

AD 4034 Actor Training II
BAKER, JODI
This course is an intermediate/advanced level scene
study course. Each iteration of the course examines
the works of either a single playwright or a single
play. The writer and the work are researched through
performance practice. The class examines the text(s)
dramaturgically while developing strategies for
performing the work effectively for contemporary
audiences. The vast majority of our class time will
be spent learning, staging, and presenting key
monologues and scenes from the play(s) for critique
and continued revision. Students will also gain a clear
understanding of the historical and political context
in which the work was written and together determine
if or how it has maintained contemporary relevance.
Besides reading the play(s) themselves and screening
examples of the work in production, students will
likely read related theory, criticism, interviews, essays
and articles by or about the playwright. Evaluation is
based on participation in class activities, readings and
discussion, successful completion of all performance
projects including productive rehearsal time both alone
and in groups, a portfolio of written responses, and
demonstrated engagement with a shared class blog.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites: Prereqs

AD 4035 Improvisation in Music

timeliness and quality of work, and thoughtful
participation in class discussion and critique.

BLOTNICK, RYAN
This hands-on theory/performance course for singers,
instrumentalists, guitarists, pianists, drummers, etc.,
deals with improvisation, a spontaneous exchange
or interplay of musical ideas and moods. It offers
the musician the opportunity to utilize his/her
technical ability to its fullest extent while enjoying
the creative freedom of spontaneous composition.
The class addresses technical and aesthetic aspects
of improvisation in all styles of music (jazz, rock,
blues, classical, folk, etc.), including the elements
of melodic development, melodic cliches, rhythmic
and melodic embellishment, harmonic substitutions,
and development of the ear. It is multilevel in format,
allowing for students of all technical proficiency to
participate. In short, this course enables students to
use the tools of improvisation to be able to make a
personal musical statement while playing, singing,
jamming, etc.

AD 5014 Graphic Attack: Advanced Graphic
Design Studio II
MENDEZ, KHRISTIAN E
The name of this course, Graphic Attack, refers
not only to the power of image and text within our
visually saturated physical and virtual environments,
but to the need to evaluate and respond critically to
mass media. Students will explore and discuss the
roles and responsibilities of designers as primary
crafters of visual messages through promotion,
advertising and identity design, and investigate the
work of artists and designers who appropriate tools
of advertising to construct alternative messages
outside of, and often in critique of, the commercial
realm.
This advanced-level studio art course combines
critical examination of contemporary graphic design
practice with studio projects in creative problem
solving. Practice in design research, layout and
composition, typography, digital imaging, and text/
image composition will be combined with hands-on
studio projects in image generation such as block
print, silkscreen, monoprint, instant photography,
xerography, and collage techniques.
Projects will range from investigations of
personal identity and branding to advertising and
package design in the retail and socio-political
environments. Through studio visits, students will
have an opportunity to meet professional artists
and designers to discuss first hand process and
ethical issues related to their work. Students will
be evaluated on conceptual problem-solving ability,
effectiveness of design solutions, understanding
and practice of the incremental process of design,

The class further develops ideas, skills, and animation
projects through a mix of in-class projects/demos/skill
based activities, readings, discussions, screenings,
presentations, and individual meetings with the
instructor. Students will write a production plan that
will serve as an outline of each student’s project(s) for
the term. The instructor will provide useful activities,
information, resources, critiques, and guidance.
A schedule of presentations of student works-inprogress will be created. Readings will address
ideas and theories related to animation studies
and processes. Advanced animation techniques
may include camera work and sound design. Work
completed over the term may be a single longer
animation or a series of animated shorts depending
on the student’s preference and animation goals. All
students will be expected to produce advanced level
work and encouraged to experiment and push their
work to the highest level. Students will be evaluated
on their projects, participation in critiques and
discussions, and overall level of engagement with the
course material and class.

AD 5023 Romanticism: The Triumph of the
Imagination over Reason?
CLINGER, CATHERINE
Scholar Isaiah Berlin considered Romanticism to
be, “the greatest single shift in the consciousness
of the West.” This advanced course will consider
the diverse body of Romantic art through thematic
enquiry, case studies, critical and historical analysis.
Divergent aesthetic ideologies in Romantic Art will
be examined in relationship to both major trends
and minor currents of intellectual thought during
the period 1780-1840 in Europe, with an emphasis
placed largely on German Romanticism. Taken
together, many of the literary and philosophical texts
associated with the movement have been understood
as fundamental critiques of rationality; however, it
is the less celebrated illustrations found in scientific
treatises and works of art not acknowledged in the
canon of the visual arts, as well as images embedded
in various forms of printed matter, which effectually
capsize Enlightenment aesthetic theories and provide
impetus to the development of Realism. Although the
COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

body of scholarly work that studies the interstices
of Romantic art, literature, and music is enormous,
the course will narrow the scope by focusing on
certain works as sites of a particular pictorial kind
of representational transdisciplinarity. The course
proposes that the widespread interconnectedness
within the fine and popular arts, through aesthetic
and material production, inform the conceptualization
of Romantic imagery. Excellent evaluations will based
on a high level of class participation, a consistent
demonstration of the close reading of assigned texts,
and a commitment to generous listening during group
discussions—along with timely submission of two short
essays and a final research paper.

AD 5025 Strangers and Performance
BAKER, JODI
This course explores the dynamics of stranger
interactions across disciplines and in a variety of
contexts, first by gaining a basic understanding of
how the topic has been considered by scientists,
social theorists, architects, and city planners over
the last century but also by understanding how these
particular social dynamics fundamentally connect
to work in theatre and in art. Through a series of
practical experiments, students discern when, why,
and how stranger interactions are meaningful, how
they differ in urban and rural contexts, and how
that meaning is tied to the shared work ethic at the
heart of the theatrical contract. We will consider the
politics of public and private spaces as well as key
strategies in staging urban centers, national parks,
schools, museums, and theatres. We’ll also examine
stranger archetypes and related terminology like
mob rule, groupthink, bystander effect, and collective
consent. Students will explore the inherent risks and
rewards that stem from personal interactions with
strangers and they will study existing and emerging
art, performance, and technology projects that
attempt to incite these interactions. Students will also
develop their own ideas for public performance and
new theatre technology. Readings will likely include
work from Kio Stark, Paul Auster and Sophie Calle,
Bertolt Brecht, Peter Brook, Roland Barthes, William
H. Whyte, George Simmel, Anne Bogart, Susan Sontag,
Jorge Luis Borges. Visual, theatre, and performance
artists may include Andrew Schneider, Richard
Renaldi, Natalia Koliada and Nicolai Khalezin, Marina
Abramovic, Chris Burden, Rotozaza, Mammalian
Diving Reflex, and Complex Movements. The course
requires a large amount of off-campus work and at
least one weekend field trip. Evaluation will be based
on consistent engagement with course topics and
the class blog, successful completion of a series of
solo and collaborative fieldwork assignments, and a

comprehensive final project w/process essay.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: This course is by
permission only. Previous coursework in theatre and
movement, art history, design and social theory is
strongly encouraged. A written expression of interest
in the course is required. Class limit: 10. Lab fee: $150.

AD 5032 Advanced Studio Printmaking
CLINGER, CATHERINE
This art studio course is a continuation of the
introductory course Studio Printmaking. A print
mirrors the surface of its matrix and presents a
reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms
of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly
in any medium requires an artist to engage in
thoughtful collaboration with materials in order
to realize the potential of form as a means of
expression. This advanced studio course will explore
ways to address this aesthetic challenge through
printmaking by experimenting with conventional and
non-traditional ways of creating a range of matrices.
Students will acquire skills as printmakers with an
emphasis on multiple-plate, collagraph, and other
advanced techniques. Students will develop a deeper
understanding of the history of prints; how they have
functioned to communicate, document, and transmit
information through images on paper—engaging with
more complex discourses of representation. Students
will be evaluated on their projects, participation in
critiques, level of engagement with materials, ability
to work in a collaborative studio, and final project.

AD 5033 Making Art: Effort, Resilience,
Persistence
ANDREWS, NANCY
In this advanced art practicum and seminar, students
will pursue the development of a body of art work
or series of art works. Through practice, critique,
discussion, readings, and interactions with artists and
those involved in supporting and presenting artists,
students will gain a better understanding of art as
an ongoing pursuit, beyond classes and assignments.
What does it take to maintain and fertilize a long-term
project or a life’s work? How can a creative process
be carried on, maintained and sustained? The primary
goal of this course is for each student to develop
their art practice, better understand their creative
processes, and show evidence of these developments.
This course is an excellent lead-up to a senior project
in the arts. Students may work in any medium, but
should already have the basic skills required for their
chosen project(s)/body of work. This course requires

with Caique Vidal, a Brazilian percussionist who will
visit the class (virtually) on a few occasions to offer
perspective and insights drawn from his experience
with the music. Alongside rehearsal and performance,
students will study the history of samba music in
Brazil. We will read Barbara Browning’s Samba:
Resistance in Motion and also discuss what the
music’s recontextualization to a college campus in
Maine might mean for its performers and listeners.
The class will include a weekend field trip to the
HONK! festival in Boston. Student assessment will
be based on rehearsal attendance, class discussion
participation, reading response journals, and a final

AD 6029 Musicianship
HENDERSON, JONATHAN
Interested in learning about music theory? Want
to learn how to better explain your songs to other
musicians? Hoping to return to an instrumental
practice that you have neglected lately, or to
begin studying a new instrument? Have a group of
musicians looking to take your performance practice
to the next level? Musicianship is an applied theorypractice course for students interested in developing
their skills as instrumentalists, composers, vocalists,
songwriters, beatmakers, or sound designers.
Students will work independently (or in small groups)
to create and implement a syllabus that reflects
their specific music-learning goals. Throughout
the term, students will meet with the professor
for weekly tutorials as they progress toward those
goals. Bi-weekly, full group workshops will focus on
key lessons in musicianship: applied music theory,
rhythmic awareness, song analysis, music production,
etc. Students are welcome to sign up individually
or in groups (e.g., a string quartet, a songwriting
partnership, or a band would be welcome to sign
up together). A final project will be determined in
consultation with the professor. A contract grading
agreement will be written between the student
and instructor at the beginning of the term. At the
term’s close, students will write a self-assessment
letter reflecting on how successfully they progressed
towards their learning goals. Each student (or small
group) will need to write a clear proposal of what they
intend to focus on. Please write Jonathan an email

EDUCATIONAL
STUDIES
ED 1010 Experiential Education
TAI, BONNIE
Even before John Dewey published Experience
and Education in 1938, experiential education had
been practiced in various forms around the world.
This course explores the philosophy of experiential
education and its diverse practices in the realms of
adventure education, service learning, workplace
learning, environmental education, museum
education, and school reform. Group activities and
fieldtrips will provide opportunities to participate
as both learner and teacher in a variety of teacherled and student-designed experiences. The final
project involves researching an existing experiential
education program, its philosophy, and its practices.
Evaluation is based on class and fieldtrip participation

ED 1013 Changing Schools, Changing
Society
TAI, BONNIE
How have schools changed and how should
schools change to ensure “the good life?” This
interdisciplinary, team-taught course examines the
potential and limits of a human-ecological education
as an instrument of enlightened progress and lasting
positive social, cultural, and environmental change.
It explores three essential questions about education
and its relationship to human development and social
progress. Looking at the role of formal educational
institutions and their relationship to government and
other social institutions: What is the role of schools
in development and social change? Considering the
role of teachers as agents of change: What is the
role of the teacher in school/organizational change
and community development? And finally, reflecting
on our subjective motives for working in the field of
education: Why do you want to become an educator?
Through course activities such as service-learning in
schools and group project work on a contemporary
educational phenomenon (e.g., school choice, new
technologies for learning, single-sex education),
students will learn how educational policy at the
federal, state, and local levels impacts teaching
and learning, investigate the moral dimensions of
the teacher-student relationship, and reflect on
the construct of teacher-learners. Students will
be introduced to a variety of educational research
methods (i.e, ethnography, case study, quasiexperimental, correlational) that will allow for critical
analysis of the knowledge base that strives to impact
educational policy and practice. Evaluation will be
based on participation, reflective writing, service
learning, and group projects and presentations.

ED 1014 Child Development
ALEX, JOANNE
How does a child think? What causes them to learn?
What teaching approaches work best with young
children? These questions and more will be explored
through readings, lectures, field observations, and
planned class activities. This course will provide an
introduction to early childhood education (preschool

to eighth grade). Theorists such as Piaget, Vygotsky,
Montessori, Gardner, Erikson, Maslow, Kohlberg,
and Gilligan will be used to examine the physical,
mental, emotional, moral, and social aspects of
childhood growth and development. Students will
explore a range of curriculum models, approaches,
and strategies as they learn to apply developmental
theory to best practices. These best practices will
include the role of teachers in creating meaningful
learning experiences and classroom environments
(curriculum), documenting learning, assessment,
inclusion, and family involvement. The primary
modes of instruction for this class will be lectures,
classroom discussions, field observations/reflections,
and cooperative hands-on learning activities. Short
reflective papers, an observational journal, and class
projects will be used to assess learning.

ED 1015 Educational Innovation
FULLER, LINDA
Given the rapid pace of change in communications,
career opportunities, learning options, and the
global economy, US schools are struggling to adapt.
As technology, culture, politics, and media facilitate
new and more diverse means of learning, how are
educators adjusting to “new” learners from toddlers
through senior adults? Driving questions include: Who
is leading innovation and where? What are some of the
ways educators are experimenting with teaching? How
are innovators changing the purposes of schools? Who
is currently starting schools and why? How is brain
research impacting innovation within and outside of
public schools? How are digital natives, eco-warriors,
and the call for global literacy accommodated in
mainstream schools? If public schools, as some
charge, have outlived their usefulness: what next for
education?
With the objective of exploring and understanding
innovative ideas for classrooms, school design, and
district structures, as well as alternative places
and means of learning, we will work toward a more
comprehensive understanding of what is new, and
potentially revolutionary, in schools and in education
beyond schooling. Evaluation will be based on class
participation (including leading a discussion around
a particular area of individual interest), a series of
four reaction papers, and both live and virtual “field”
explorations of innovative practices and organizations.
The final project will be based on the design and
proposal of an innovative educational option.

ED 1016 Introduction to Adolescent
Psychology
HILL, KENNETH
This course focuses on the segment of the human life
span from puberty to early adulthood. In this class
we will examine the physical, cognitive, social, and
moral aspects of adolescent growth and development.
Issues to be considered include adolescent
relationships (peers, family, romantic), adolescent
issues (identity formation, at risk behavior, schooling,
and stereotypes), and critical reflection on one’s
own adolescent experience. The main objectives of
this course are to: 1) provide students with a working
knowledge of the theories of psychology which pertain
to early adolescent development; 2) help students
develop the ability to critically analyze information
and common assumptions about the development
of adolescents; 3) consider contemporary issues
and concerns of the field; and 4) to afford students
the opportunity to explore their own adolescent
development. Course work entails lecture, discussion,
extensive case analysis, and a field component.

ED 1017 Young Adult Literature
RYAN, SIOBHAN
Students will learn about the history of and current
trends in Young Adult Literature. Young adult
literature is one of the strongest areas of publishing
in the United States. For example, in 2014 The Fault
in Our Stars was the best selling print and ebook
work in America. Exposure to young adult literature
will allow pre-service teachers to have an overview
of current titles that can be used in or out of class,
while students not interested in teaching will have
opportunities to stretch their reading and writing
canon. Assignments will include reading both
academic and trade books as well as articles. Students
will learn through a variety of methods from class
discussion to preparing class lectures. They will be
in touch with professional young adult writers, and
they will also have choice in a term-long project that
will be done throughout the trimester. Evaluation
is on a continual basis as the course is structured
to allow students to demonstrate growth over the
course of the trimester. There will be rubrics for class
participation and assignments, and students will
complete self-evaluations.

ED 1019 Advocacy and Education for English
Learners
CHIEN, MING-TSO
Cultural and linguistic diversity in the classroom is
becoming increasingly prevalent around the world.
56

In the United States, for example, approximately 10
percent of all students in public schools are English
learners (ELs), i.e., students who are in the process
of acquiring English as an additional language. ELs
enjoy valuable opportunities with their additional
set of cultural and linguistic resources, but they
may also face discrimination as a result of racism,
linguicism, and/or xenophobia. These forms of
discrimination, along with other systemic barriers,
can negatively affect ELs’ academic achievement and
sense of belonging in their schools and communities.
This course, based on a framework of culturally
and linguistically responsive pedagogy, has two
overarching goals. First, it aims to equip aspiring
educators with the tools to recognize and respond
to bias and inequity in the education of ELs. Second,
it aims to introduce these future educators to the
fundamental principles and techniques for teaching
and advocating for culturally and linguistically diverse
students. Human ecologists planning to work as
educators in the school or the communities to serve
ELs and their family will find this course helpful.
Students who take this course will learn through
active and critical engagements with readings
and audio-visual materials, whole-class and group
discussions, reflective and analytical writings, lesson
planning, micro-teaching, and project planning. They
will be evaluated through weekly responses to course
materials as well as individual and team projectbased assignments, such as interviews with ELs or
current EL educators, advocacy projects targeting
issues affecting ELs, and outreach initiatives that
build partnerships and/or enhance cross-cultural
understanding.

ED 1022 Learning in the Arts through
Exploration
SHUTT, CAROL
In this course, students will explore teaching and
learning in the arts as a process of exploration,
personal expression, and nurturance. This process,
one of discovery, begins without preconceived
expectations of outcomes and allows for response
and reflection through the artmaking. This approach
will be explored as a means of teaching art to others,
while also adding to one’s own creativity and artistic
growth. Students will work with the elements and
principles of design, using a variety of techniques and
materials (drawing, painting, collage) to understand
and teach the art process. We will create some shared
work in class, such as narrative memory maps and
contour-drawn portraits, in order to experience
the art process in collaboration. Students will also
explore the ecology and economy of altering found
materials for artmaking, as well as investigate creative
ways to use text and writing in art (Exquisite Corpse,
Allen Ginsberg’s American Sentences, Black-Out

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

Poetry.) Relevant artists’ writings and work will be
read and discussed in class. Evaluation will be based
on attendance, participation, class activities, and
completed assignments. Assignments will include: coleading discussions of class readings, ongoing work in
personal sketchbooks, responses and creative writing
exercises in journals, and altering an old book (we’ll
use discarded library books) to create a source book
of techniques for teaching and making art.

ED 2010 Disability Rights in Education
RABASCA, ADAM
Across the country, varying state regulations and
practices call into question the manner with which
students with disabilities are taught, served, and
prepared for the future in an economically and socially
challenging community and environment. Their rights
are governed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act. Course participants
will learn how students with disabilities are ensured
their rights to access and a free appropriate public
education as well as how this translates into postsecondary education, employment, and society.
Students will be evaluated on synthesis of information
in written format and in visual presentation and on
in-class, mutli-modal engagement. Students will also
be expected to complete an independent research
project evaluating the manner in which disability
rights are ensured within the very community and
environment in which we live.

ED 2011 Equity and Social Justice in
Education
CHIEN, MING-TSO
In this course, students will be introduced to the
fundamental concepts related to educational equity
and social justice. They will examine how power,
privilege and oppression operate across and/or at
the intersection of social identities grounded in the
following topic areas: poverty and socioeconomic
status, gender identity and expression, (dis)ability,
race, as well as sexual orientation. To that end,
students will engage in in-depth exploration of their
social identities and check their own prejudice.
Concurrently, they will practice skills that allow them
to recognize and respond to identity-based biases
within educational contexts and work towards creating
and sustaining equitable and inclusive learning
environments for all learners, but especially for those
coming from the marginalized communities. Every
week, students will read texts that introduce key
concepts in one of the above-mentioned topic areas.

They will also practice analyzing cases that depict
scenarios of bias and inequity in education, using the
Equity Literacy Framework. In addition to their peers,
students will also engage in weekly conversations
and discussions with guest speakers from diverse
educational communities, such as K-12 schools,
higher education institutions, educational community
organizations, etc. Evaluation will be based on the
following: an autoethnographic portfolio that consists
of the artifacts each student produces throughout
the term while exploring their own social identities as
well as a reflection paper; a review of a book in one of
the above-mentioned topic areas; and a final project
where students work in groups to create digital
resource guides that educators can use to address
social justice issues with their learners.

ED 3010 Understanding and Managing
Group Dynamics
TAI, BONNIE
This course will examine essential questions
about how groups function, whether the group is
a committee involved in institutional governance,
a class of adolescents, or a cohort of business
colleagues. Readings, activities, and assignments
will weigh traditional and alternative conceptions of
leadership, power, authority, community, diversity,
membership, and exclusion. Students will engage in
case discussions, writing (including autobiography
and creative writing), and research activities. A major
component of the course will be the observation and
analysis of a group (e.g., in a community organization,
business, or school). The final paper will be the
creation and analysis of a case. Evaluation will be
based on class participation, responses to readings,
facilitation of a case discussion, an autobiographical
essay, a short story, reports of observations, and
the final paper. Students will be expected to take the

ED 3106 Teaching Comprehensive Sexuality
Education
MAGNUSON, MADALYNNE
Where do babies come from? Can you pee with a
tampon in? If a boy withdraws his penis and doesn’t
use a condom, what are the chances of getting
pregnant? What if you enjoy gay sex but you think
you’re straight? From birth to death people are
curious about their bodies and relationships. So why
is it that so many people feel they lack the knowledge
and skills to be sexually healthy? This class will begin
by exploring the tenets of comprehensive sexuality
education (CSE), its history, and the religious,
cultural, and political reasons as to why it is or isn’t
taught across the globe. Over the course of the
term, students will explore theoretical frameworks
and strategies for teaching CSE, design an original
lesson plan, practice facilitating, and provide
feedback to their peers. Course topics may include
strategies for cultivating safe learning environments
and tools for promoting classroom discussion. We
will discuss the principles of mentorship and how
to engage young people in positive conversations
about sexual decisions, as well as how to navigate
teaching across diverse cultures, personalities and
learning preferences. This hybrid course will be taught
through a combination of evening zoom sessions with
occasional Saturday, day-long intensives. Students will
be expected to attend Maine’s Annual Comprehensive
Sexuality Education Conference. Evaluation will be
based on class participation (which will include small
classroom assignments), writing an original lesson
plan, and delivering a sex education event on campus.
Readings will include writing on evidence-based
approaches to sexuality education.

ED 4014 Tutorial: Contemplative Science,
Practice, and Education
TAI, BONNIE
Since the turn of the millennium, research into
the science of contemplative practices—such as
meditation, qigong, taiji, and yoga, among others—has
exploded. The intersection of these practices with
fields such as cognitive and affective neuroscience,
cognitive and developmental psychology, integrative
medicine, comparative religion, education, and
sustainability science examine the impacts on mental
and physical health, socio-emotional learning, and
a less consumption-driven future. This tutorial will
survey those practices supported by evidence from
recent research. The application of these practices
have similarly flourished in mindfulness-based
interventions and programs in therapeutic settings
and schooling from early childhood to adult education
and professional programs including counseling,
medicine, law, social work, and teacher education.
Pedagogical approaches apply to classroom contexts
as well as informal settings such as environmental
education and include diverse approaches
such as collaborative poetry and contemplative
photography. This tutorial engages students in a
review of the research literature in parallel with
micro-phenomenological inquiry through sustained
individual or group practice with one or two practices
and journaling. Students will also spend a substantial
portion of the tutorial engaging in a variety of
contemplative practices with area teachers while
working on research or education projects. Evaluation
will include an annotated bibliography, synthesis of a
practice-based micro-phenomenological journal, and
a research or education project proposal focused on a
practice of interest.

ED 5010 Curriculum Design and
Assessment
TAI, BONNIE
Human ecologists who educate embrace not only
the interdisciplinarity of knowledge, but also the
complexity of individual student development in
political school environments. This course focuses on
two essential nuts and bolts of teaching: curriculum
design and assessment. How can a teacher learn
what students know, how they think, and what they
have learned? How can a teacher use this knowledge
of students and subject matter to plan learning
experiences that will engage diverse interests, adapt
to a wide range of learning styles and preferences,
accommodate exceptional needs, and meet statemandated curriculum standards? This course is a
required course for prospective secondary school
teachers that provides an introduction to the
backward design process and diverse assessment
strategies. Students will engage in examining theory
and practice designing and implementing curricula
and assessments. A service-learning component will
provide students with the opportunity to observe and
participate in a variety of assessment methods in the
subject they aim to teach. The final project will be a
collaboratively designed, integrated curriculum unit,
including lesson plans and assessments. Evaluation
will be based on participation, reflective writing,
individually designed lesson plans and assessments,
and the final project.

for equity, and a moral imperative for excellence in
teaching. Students spend 70 hours with their target
population and curriculum, as well as consulting with
content faculty (Some of these hours may be reserved
for fall term.). These learning-teaching experiences
are integrated into class discussion where students
analyze the elements needed for successful teaching,
learning, and assessing in their own content area
and across disciplines. The purposes, problems,
opportunities, issues, strategies, and materials
involved in teaching diverse adolescent and young
adult learners will be examined critically, and students

ED 5013 Student Teaching
FULLER, LINDA
The student teaching internship represents the
student teaching requirement for COA’S teacher
certification candidates. Success in this experience
is a pivotal criterion in the student’s certification
candidacy. The student is placed in a school, usually
in the immediate region, with a cooperating teacher
who teaches subjects and grade levels that match
the certification goals of the student. The roles of
student teacher, cooperating teacher, school principal,
and COA supervisor are discussed and agreed upon
in advance. Incrementally, the student teacher
becomes familiar with class routines and gradually
takes responsibility for teaching. Within the fifteenweek experience, the student teacher must take on
a full load (all classes and all duties) for the number
of weeks agreed upon by all parties. This period of
time varies with subjects, grade level, and specific
student goals. The COA supervisor visits the schools
in a liaison capacity, and also evaluates the student
teacher’s performance a minimum of eight times in
the term. Student teachers meet together regularly
to discuss such issues as curriculum planning,
instruction, best teaching practices, classroom
learning environment, and broader educational issues.
Students may use student teaching to fulfill the COA
internship requirement if it is completed prior to
graduation.

The study of ornithology is as old as human society
itself. Birds are particularly conspicuous elements of
our world, and figure prominently in our art, religious
symbolism, mythology, scientific endeavors and even
sport. Birds appear in European paleolithic cave
paintings from 14,000 years ago, domesticated fowl
are known from India circa 3000 BC, and ancient

scholars such as Aristotle and Pliny the Elder devoted
considerable time to ornithological observations.
In this century great strides have been made in the
study of population biology and ecology, navigation
and migration, and human induced ecological change
(sometimes called human ecology), all through the
study of birds. This class introduces the student to the
ornithological world by using both scientific literature
and direct field observation. Systematics and
physiology will be reviewed, but much of our effort will
concentrate on reproductive ecology, behavior and
the environment, and population dynamics. There will
be a strong emphasis on field observation—learning
how to look at birds and their behavior in order
to perhaps make larger observations about their
environment.

ES 1018 Physics I: Mechanics and Energy
FELDMAN, DAVID
This course is the first of a two-course sequence
covering a range of standard introductory physics
topics. The goals of the course are to introduce
students to important physical ideas both
conceptually and mathematically and to help students
improve their quantitative skills. The first part of
the course consists of a broad look at the three
conservation laws: the conservation of momentum,
energy, and angular momentum. Along the way, we’ll
learn about vectors, work, potential energy, thermal
energy, and the energy stored in chemical bonds. We’ll
conclude with a treatment of Newton’s laws of motion.
If time permits, we may briefly cover some topics
from chaotic dynamics. Evaluations will be based on
participation in class and lab, weekly homework, and
two untimed, open-notes exams. This course makes
extensive use of algebra and trigonometry. Potentially
difficult math topics will be reviewed as necessary.

giant, all-connected ocean. This ocean has a profound
effect on the planet’s climate, chemistry, ecosystem,
and energy resources. Billions of years ago life began
there, in what now we regard as the last unexplored
frontier of this planet. In this course we examine the
various disciplines within oceanography, including
aspects of geology and sedimentology, chemical,
dynamic, and biological oceanography. The course

concludes with an introduction to marine ecosystems
examined at various trophic levels, including phyto/
zooplankton, fish, and other macrofauna. Fieldwork
(weather dependent) includes trips on RV Indigo, trips
to intertidal and estuarine ecosystems, and possible
visits to the college’s islands, Mount Desert Rock, and
Great Duck Island. Evaluation will be by lab, quizzes,

ES 1026 Introduction to Chaos and Fractals
FELDMAN, DAVID
This course presents an elementary introduction to
chaos and fractals. The main focus will be on using
discrete dynamical systems to illustrate many of
the key phenomena of chaotic dynamics: stable and
unstable fixed and periodic points, deterministic
chaos, bifurcations, and universality. A central result
of this study will be the realization that very simple
non-linear equations can exhibit extremely complex
behavior. In particular, a simple deterministic system
(i.e., physical system governed by simple, exact
mathematical rules) can behave in a way that is
unpredictable and random, (i.e., chaotic). This result
suggests that there are potentially far-reaching
limits on the ability of science to predict certain
phenomena. Students in this class will also learn about
fractals—self-similar geometric objects—including the
Mandelbrot and Julia sets. We will also read about
and discuss the development of the field of chaos.
In so doing, we will examine the nature of scientific
communities, with a particular eye toward how
changes in scientific outlooks occur. Throughout the
course, students will be encouraged to explore the
relations between chaos, fractals, and other areas
of study such as literature, art, and cultural studies.
Students who successfully complete this class should
gain a quantitative and qualitative understanding
of the basic ideas of chaos and fractals, a greater
understanding of the cultural practice of science, and

ES 1030 Chemistry II
HUDSON, REUBEN
This is the second half of a two-term sequence
designed to help students describe and understand
properties of materials. This course begins with a
survey of how the internal structure of atoms leads
to the formation of different sorts of bonds between
them. It then considers how weaker forces can
arise between molecules and the sorts of physical
phenomena that such forces explain. The class
concludes by considering how to describe and explain
the rates at which (and the extents to which) chemical
reactions occur and applies such descriptions and
explanations to common types of reactions (acid/
base and redox). Throughout the course, examples are
drawn from living systems, the natural environment,
and industrial products. The course meets for three
hours of lecture/discussion and for three hours
of lab each week. Evaluations are based on class
participation, homework, midterm and final exams,
and a term project or paper. Offered every year.

explore cellular processes involved in metabolism,
communication, growth, and reproduction. There
is a strong emphasis on the understanding the
genetic basis of these processes as well as how these
processes are controlled, and we will delve into the
structure and function of the DNA molecule in some
detail. We will examine how our understanding of
genetic processes and genome sequencing has led
to applications in research, medicine, agriculture,
and industry, with time also devoted to discussion
of the social and ethical consequences attached to
these technological innovations. Students will be
evaluated on participation, performance on problem
sets and quizzes throughout the term, and a final oral

ES 1054 Biology: Form and Function
STAFF
This is one half of a twenty-week, two-term
introductory course in biology, providing an
overview of the discipline and prerequisite for many
intermediate and advanced biology courses. The
course will emphasize biological structures at the
level of whole organisms and organs and their role in
the survival and reproduction of individuals and the
evolution of populations. We will explore principles
of evolution, classification, anatomy and physiology,
epidemiology, behavior, and basic ecology. The
primary focus of the course is on vertebrate animals
and vascular plants, but we will make forays into
other phylogenetic lineages at intervals. Weekly field
and laboratory studies introduce students to the
local range of habitats and a broad array of protists,
plants, and animals. Attendance at two lectures and
one lab each week is required; course evaluation is
based on class participation, exams, preparation of a
lab/field notebook, and a presentation. It should be
stressed that this course emphasizes the unity of the

subsequently enroll in Biology: Cells and Molecules in
order to further their exploration of issues in a more
reductionist form, but neither course is a prerequisite
for the other.

ES 1056 Physics and Mathematics of
Sustainable Energy
FELDMAN, DAVID
In this course students will learn content and skills
so that they can participate effectively in sustainable
energy projects, make personal and community
decisions that reduce carbon emissions, and work

in ventures in sustainable energy. Additionally,
this course will be useful for those interested in
energy and climate policy, either internationally or
domestically. We will begin with a quick overview
of current CO2 emissions levels and look at how
this is related to energy use. We will then turn our
attention to basic ideas from physics, including the
definition of energy and the difference between
energy and power. The bulk of the course will consist
of a survey of different forms of energy consumption
and generation. Throughout, we will quantitatively
analyze technology from both a local and global point
of view. For example, we will calculate how much
electricity one can generate on a rooftop, and we will
also examine the role that solar PV could play toward
the goal of eliminating fossil fuel use worldwide. In
a unit on financial mathematics, students will learn
about the time value of money and several ways
of quantifying investments, including ROI (return
on investment) and IRR (internal rate of return).
Students will apply these financial tools in several
short case studies. If time permits, we may also cover
negative emissions technologies and the electrical
grid, including grid stability issues and the potential
of smart-grid technology. This will be a demanding,
introductory, class. Evaluation will be based on weekly
problem sets.

ES 1066 Chemistry I
HUDSON, REUBEN
This is the first half of a two-term sequence designed
to help students describe and understand properties
of materials. The course first explores how atomic and
molecular structure relates to the physical properties
of materials and their reactivity. The course explores
the reasons, rates, and outcomes of chemical
reactions. Course material is applied to better
understand living systems, the natural environment,
and industrial products. The course meets for three
hours of lecture/discussion and for three hours of lab
each week. Students are strongly urged to take both
terms of this course. Evaluations are based on class
participation, lab reports, and quizzes.

equilibrium, colloids, and solubility of gases in
liquids. Major biology topics include photosynthesis,
respiration, plant and yeast life histories, cellular
reproduction, and metabolism. We will also explore
agricultural chemistry from a systems perspective,
examining strategies for keeping pace with the
demand for nitrogen and phosphorous in soils. This
course is meant to offer important, fundamental
chemistry and biology through the framework of food,
a universal human experience. These fundamental
topics in chemistry and biology will be explored from
the ground up, so no prior experience is required.
Meanwhile, the culinary and agricultural framework
should offer enough new content for students with
a background in natural sciences. Students will be
evaluated based on participation in classroom and
laboratory sessions, projects, and quizzes.

ES 1075 Geology of National Parks
HALL, SARAH
In this introductory geoscience course students will
learn foundational principles and concepts such as
plate tectonics, geologic time, climate and weather,
rocks and minerals, and surface processes through
an exploration of some of the National Parks of the
United States. Through virtual field trips of various
parks, students will visualize how regional climate and
surface processes such as rivers, glaciers, and wind
interact with the bedrock and surficial materials to
produce some of the most iconic landscapes. While
Acadia National Park offers a view of an ancient and
eroded supervolcano, Yellowstone offers a glimpse of
a dynamic landscape built on a modern supervolcano.
While a few glaciers still cling to the high peaks of
Glacier National Park, Yosemite hosts steep glacially
carved valleys and polished domes reminiscent of a
glaciated past. Class time will be used for lectures,
discussions of readings, and laboratory exercises.
During labs, students will get to know approximately
six different parks in detail through interaction with
geologic maps, rock samples, aerial imagery, and
scientific reports. The students will be evaluated
based on laboratory exercises and a final project
through which students will explore one park of their
choosing.

ES 1076 Polar Ecology and Exploration
TODD, SEAN
The Arctic and Antarctic represent some of the most
extreme environments on the planet. As physical
places, both poles play an important role in governing

64

the planet’s climate and heat flow. Both are suspected
to be rich in minerals and are thought to perhaps
hold short-term relief from current world shortages
in natural resources. As ecosystems, both are hugely
productive in spite of, and in part because of, the
extreme temperatures they experience; certain
species are found nowhere else and in fact thrive
in these remote locales. Superimposed upon these
natural environments is the presence of humans.
Exploration of both areas has been particularly
focused in the past century, with countless stories of
the perseverance and persistence of our pioneering
spirit. Initially surveyed to forward nationalistic
agendas, both poles are now sites of scientific inquiry.
In particular, the political model that currently
governs Antarctica as one massive protected area has
no precedent and perhaps suggests a way forward
for environmental agendas working on global scales.
More recently, the poles have been exploited by
ecotourism businesses.
This class examines the provinces of the Arctic
and Antarctic, wildernesses whose boundaries can
be defined physically, biologically, geologically,
and politically. We will examine the rich and highly
adapted diversity of life as it is affected by local and
global oceanography and atmospheric science, and
assess the impacts of climate change on these fragile
environments. We will also review our relationship
with these places and examine what future we
might play in preserving and/or exploiting the polar
regime, using human ecology as a model for our
understanding. Evaluation will be by two term papers
and participation in class activities.

ES 1081 Plants and People: Economic
Botany
LETCHER, SUSAN
This class offers an introduction to plant biology
centered around plants that are useful to human
societies. We will explore plant anatomy, physiology,
evolution, and ecology through case studies involving
plants that are useful to humans. Through lectures,
readings, and discussions, students will gain a rich
understanding of how plants function and how
human societies depend on them in myriad ways. We
will cover universal and familiar uses of plants such
as food, building materials, and textiles, as well as
less widely practiced uses including arrow poisons,
lacquers, and living fences. We will discuss the origins
of agriculture and methods of plant breeding, as
well as the biogeographical history of important
cultivated plant lineages. The focus will be on plants
and our uses for them, but we will also discuss ethical
concerns surrounding practices like bioprospecting
and ex situ conservation. Students will be evaluated

ES 1082 Climate and Seasons: Maple
Production
HUDSON, REUBEN
Through the lens of maple production, we will
explore a variety of chemistry, biology, and climate
science topics, including: climate, seasonality, plant
physiology, density, (reverse) osmosis, and the
chemistry of sugars. The hands-on aspects of these
topics will be covered during an intensive 2-week
period over spring break, which historically overlaps
with the maple sap run in this area. Students will
learn how to identify maple, birch, butternut and
other tree species which produce viable sap for syrup
production. Students will tap these trees, collect
the sap, and concentrate it by reverse osmosis and
by boiling. Students will also learn how to prune
fruit trees, and why we do this in the same season.
Students will be evaluated based on their participation
in the 2-week spring-break session, as well as through
assignments, papers, and a final project completed
during the spring term.

ES 1083 Lichen Biology
OLDAY, FRED
This course is a general introduction to the biology
of lichens, including the unique nature of the lichen
symbiosis and the structure, reproduction, chemistry,
and ecophysiology of these intriguing organisms.
Particular emphasis is given to field and laboratory
methods of identification including field recognition
of important genera, micro-habitat preferences of
selected species, collection techniques, use of keys,
methods of identification, and proper curation. Major
goals of the course are to have students develop
the “hands on” skills and the confidence necessary
to identify lichens to the species level. The class will
meet twice a week, three hours each meeting, with
one hour devoted to lecture, two hours to lab. An
all-day Saturday field trip is planned at the beginning
of the term to introduce students to the diversity
of microhabitats in which lichens are found, proper
collection techniques, writing brief, accurate field
notes, and starting their personal collections. In
addition, one or more Saturday morning help sessions
will be provided if needed to help students get started
on their personal collections. The course grade
will be based on: (a) class participation (10%); (b)
demonstrated capacity for doing independent work
(20%); (c) bi-weekly quizzes (40%); and (d) a student

final project consisting of a properly identified and
curated collection of 15 species of lichens, excluding
taxa previously identified in class as part of group
keying exercises or needing the assistance of the
instructor (30%). The final project must include a
minimum of seven crustose lichens. Bonus course
credit will be given for any new MDI, county, or state
records (5%).

ES 1085 Data Science I: Visualization
BAKER, LAURIE
How can one summarize information and data and
convey its meaning to others? What is an effective
data visualization? What is an ineffective or dishonest
one? And, for that matter, what is data? This course
will explore these questions by introducing students to
the broad field of information visualization. Students
will learn about different types of visualizations that
may be used to explore variation and covariation, the
evolution of processes through time and space, and
representing parts of a whole. Much of the work of this
course will be carried out using computers and the R
programming language, but we will also explore noncomputational approaches to visualization. Students
will develop skills in data collection, data cleaning, and
creating different types of data visualizations (e.g.
bar charts, scatter plots, density plots, heat maps,
violin plots, time series, and interactive graphics)
and effective data communication while working on
problems and case studies inspired by and based on
real-world questions. We will also critique and reflect
upon data visualizations in our daily lives. Students
will also gain familiarity with descriptive statistics
and ways to organize and summarize categorical and
numerical data to pick out key information.
This course is designed to serve as an introduction to
programming in R. Students will learn to gain insight
from data, to use literate programming and version
control so that these insights are reproducible by
others, and to develop code collaboratively. Students
who successfully complete this course will be able to
work with large data sets, transform those data, and
implement effective visualizations. Throughout the
course we will be using GitHub, ggplot2, Rmarkdown,
gganimate, RShiny and the tidyverse packages for
data manipulation. This course is intended to appeal
to a wide range of students. The skills and habits of
mind taught in this course are applicable not only
in the sciences and social sciences, but in almost
all fields. Evaluation will be based on several short
homework and lab assignments, participation in inclass activities, and a final project.

ES 1086 Introduction to Field Sampling:
Collection to Data Points
HUDSON, REUBEN
In this course, students will learn how to ask relevant
field science questions, how to collect samples in
the field (soil, water, air, plant, plankton, sediment),
how to process the samples in the lab (sieving,
counting, digesting, extracting), how to turn those
samples into data points, and how to communicate
the findings. When technical field skills are necessary
for sample collection, we will offer co-curricular
instruction (knot tying, canoeing for lake sediment
coring, kayaking for water sampling, etc). This course
will cover microplastic analysis in water and soils,
water chemistry (ions, pH, organic pollutants), and
charcoal analysis in sediments. Students will be
evaluated based on participation in field sampling,
lab processing, and lecture discussions, as well as
through regular problem sets and a term-long writing
project. Students will need waterproof shoes, sturdy
hiking boots, raingear (rain pants and raincoat) and
appropriate layers (synthetic or wool) for spending
prolonged periods of time outside. If students do not
have their own personal gear we can provide it for
them if we are informed by the start of the course.
All technical equipment (canoes, lifejackets, coring
equipment) will be provided.
This course is not by permission of instructor, but it is
linked to a pre-matriculation summer STEM program.
All seats will be reserved for first-year students.
Admitted students will be invited to join the prematriculation summer STEM program. Students who
join the summer STEM program (this will happen prior
to registration) will be given priority to join the class.
If there are open seats not taken by students doing
the summer STEM program, then these seats can be
made available to other incoming first-year students
when they register.

In this course, students will learn to identify ~70
common rocks and minerals in hand sample, and
a few common minerals in thin section. Building
on their ability to identify minerals, students will
learn to properly classify igneous, sedimentary, and
metamorphic rocks using standard classification
methods. Beyond learning about igneous,

sedimentary, and metamorphic rock-forming
environments, we will cover topics such as plate
tectonics, geologic time, basic petrology and
mineralogy, tools and instruments used for chemical
and physical analysis, and natural resources related to
rocks and minerals. By the end of the term, students
will be able to relate a rock to its environment of
formation, identify common rocks and minerals
in hand sample, and relate the types and spatial
distribution of rocks and minerals to the geologic
history of Mount Desert Island and Maine. The course
will include weekly readings from mineralogy and
petrology textbooks and web resources. Students will
complete a rock/mineral lab each week and quizzes
every other week. We will visit a few local field sites
and as well as conduct one weekend-long collecting
trip to sites throughout Maine. The students will be
evaluated based on their performance on the weekly

GRAHAM, CARRIE
Nearly 80% of all described species belong to the
class Insecta. Due to their abundance, diversity,
and adaptability, insects are crucial components of
terrestrial, freshwater, and human-made ecosystems.
Students with a background in entomology can
apply their knowledge of insects to many other
fields, including botany, ecology, anthropology,
epidemiology, medicine, agriculture, climate change,
visual arts, history, and even the culinary arts. This
course will give students a sampling of entomological
applications within these diverse fields. Students
will be given a solid introduction to insect biology,
ecology, taxonomy, and identification through
lectures, lab sessions, and field trips. They will
assemble their own insect collections and will learn
to identify all Maine insect orders and many common
insect families. Lectures, field trips, and readings will
emphasize the important role of insects in human
lives and our impact on the environment. Students will

ES 2041 Physics II: Relativity
FELDMAN, DAVID
This version of Physics II covers Einstein’s theory of
special relativity. Topics covered include the principle
of relativity, spacetime intervals and proper time,
coordinate transformations, Lorentz contraction,
and relativistic energy and momentum. We will start
with first principles and carefully build toward key
results, allowing students to see how relativity—one
of the pillars of modern physics—was constructed
and how it coheres as a mathematically consistent
and experimentally verified theory. To gain a sense
of the scientific, social, and material context in which
the theory of relativity was developed, we will read
Einstein’s Clocks and Poincaré’s Maps: Empires of
Time, by Peter Galison. This class makes extensive use
of algebra. Students should be comfortable working
with mathematical abstraction. Evaluation based on
weekly problem sets, class participation, several short
writing assignments, and a final exam or project.

ES 2045 Applied Data Science
SHANK, KYLE S
There isn’t really much consensus on what data
science actually is. Some argue that it’s a nascent
68

interdisciplinary field that encompasses elements
of computer science, applied statistics, and data
visualization. Others insist that it’s a “fourth
paradigm” of science: empirical, theoretical,
computational, and now data-driven. Regardless
of what it is, what may be most important is to
understand what data science does and what you can
learn to do with it!
This course will be both a broad overview of how data
science is done in the “real world” with a specific focus
on learning applications of practical data science
skills. This would be a great class for those interested
in an introductory exploration of data science as a
primary area of focus as well as those looking to add a
degree of technical expertise with data to preexisting
work and interests. We’ll be focusing on four major
areas of application: (1) properly building data-driven
questions and hypotheses; (2) obtaining, organizing,
and transforming data; (3) exploratory data analysis
and pattern recognition; and, as time permits, (4)
data visualization and communication. Leaving this
class, students will be able to immediately apply these
concepts to a broad array of interests. For example:
students should be able to generate hypotheses
from disparate data sources (such as minutes from
ACM), obtain and transform data from websites (like
accessing the US Census Bureau API), explore and
analyze data to discover patterns (such as through
spatial biological data sets), and visualize such data
for easy communication to peers and laypersons.
Classes will be taught as a mix of live coding
exercises, lectures, and group discussions. No prior
programming experience is required—we’re going to
be learning to use the R programming language in
this course— but a familiarity with computers and data
will be helpful. Students will need to use either their
personal laptop or a COA loaner laptop for class and
programming exercises. Evaluation will be through
class participation and discussion, several data
investigation exercises, and a final project. The data
investigations will take the form of written analyses of
several well-known data sets as well as investigations
of synthetic ones created specifically for the course.
The final project will take the form of an oral
presentation of an analysis. This can be either done in
a group or as an individual and may be of any topic of
sufficient interest to the student(s) involved.

ES 2046 Physics II: Modern Physics
FELDMAN, DAVID
What are relativity and quantum mechanics, and
why were they viewed as revolutionary when they
were formulated in the early 1900s? How and why
does relativity and quantum mechanics compel us
to discard commonsense ideas about the nature
of the physical world that are part of classical
COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

mechanics? Why is there not agreement on how
to interpret quantum mechanics, and why does
quantum mechanics even need interpretation?
This version of Physics II covers Einstein’s theory
of special relativity and selected topics in quantum
mechanics, and is designed to introduce students
to some of the formalism and central results of
relativity and quantum mechanics, so that they can
formulate scientifically grounded answers to the
above questions. Throughout the course we will start
with first principles and carefully build toward key
results, allowing students to see how relativity and
quantum mechanics—two of the pillars of modern
physics—were constructed and how they cohere
as mathematically consistent and experimentally
verified theories. The first half of the course will
cover relativity topics including the principle of
relativity, spacetime intervals and proper time,
coordinate transformations, time dilation and Lorentz
contraction, and relativistic energy and momentum.
The second half of the course will turn toward the
foundations of quantum mechanics, including:
spin-1/2 particles, wave-particle duality, and Bell’s
inequalities and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.
If time permits, we may cover additional topics such
as blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect,
Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom, and quantum
cryptography. To gain a sense of the scientific, social,
and material context in which the theories of relativity
and quantum mechanics were developed, we will read
a number of papers and book chapters by historians
and philosophers of science. This course is designed
to appeal to a wide range of students—both those
whose interests lie outside of science as well as those
who are drawn toward the sciences or mathematics.
Students who take this course should be comfortable
working with mathematical abstraction. Evaluation is
based on weekly problem sets, participation in weekly
discussion sections, and several short reflection
assignments.

ES 3010 Agroecology
MORSE, SUZANNE
The global demand for food and fiber will continue
to increase well into the next century. How will this
food and fiber be produced? Will production be at
the cost of soil loss, water contamination, pesticide
poisoning, and increasing rural poverty? In this
course, we examine the fundamental principles and
practices of conventional and sustainable agriculture
with a primary focus on crops. By examining farm case
studies and current research on conventional and
alternative agriculture we develop a set of economic,
social, and ecological criteria for a critique of current
agricultural practices in the United States and that
will serve as the foundation for the development and

analysis of new farming systems. Evaluations are
based on two exams, class presentations, participation
in a conference on potato production, and a final
paper.

ES 3014 Ecology
ANDERSON, JOHN
This course examines ecology in the classic sense:
the study of the causes and consequences of the
distribution and abundance of organisms. We examine
the assumptions and predictions of general models
of predator-prey interactions, inter- and intra-species
competition, island biogeography, and resource
use, and compare these models to the results of
experimental tests in lab and field. In addition we
discuss appropriate techniques used by ecologists
in collecting data in the field, note taking and the
appropriate collation and storage of field data.
Although this course is NOT a course in conservation
biology, we examine how ecological principles are
applied to conservation questions. Readings include
selections from the primary literature. Students are
evaluated on the basis of class participation and two
in-depth problem sets, drawing extensively on the

community ecology. Readings are chosen from a
text and from primary literature. The course consists
of two lecture/discussion sessions per week and
one lab/field trip every week. Weather dictates the
number and focus of field trips, but students should
expect to participate in both day and night field trips
throughout the term. Students are evaluated on class
participation, exams, and a term-long field project.

Placement Calculus tests, are ready for Calculus III,
as are students who have had Calc I and II here or
at another college. Calc III re-visits topics from Calc
I and II and extends them to multivariable functions
and vector fields. This is a great class for students
who want to review their calculus and take their math
to the next level.

ES 3028 Calculus III: Multivariable
Calculus
FELDMAN, DAVID
The functions studied in Calculus I and II are onedimensional. But the universe of everyday experience
is, at minimum, three-dimensional. In this course
we explore how calculus can be extended so as to
apply to functions of more than one variable, and
thus apply to the three-dimensional world. We will
begin by reviewing vectors and functions of several
variables. We will then learn about partial derivatives
and gradients and how apply these tools to
multivariable optimization. Turning our attention to
integral calculus, we will next cover double and triple
integrals and their applications. We will conclude
with a treatment of line integrals, flux integrals, the
divergence and curl of a vector field, and Green’s,
and Stokes’s theorems. Evaluation will be based on
class participation and lengthy weekly problem sets.

ES 3032 Genetics
This course will explore the many roles that genes
play in the biology of organisms, the molecular basis
of gene function, and the methodologies used in
genetic research and application. Students in this
course should already have a basic understanding
from an introductory biology course of the structure
and function of genes and chromosomes, the
processes involved in gene expression, and patterns of
inheritance. This course will explore these phenomena
more deeply as well as delve into a range of other
topics, including population genetics, quantitative
genetics, genes in development, genomics, and using
genetic data to understand human evolution. We
will also discuss the use of genetic engineering in
industry, agriculture, medicine, and research. We will
meet twice weekly for lectures and once per week for
discussion of readings and problem sets. Evaluation
is based on short problem sets, take-home exams, an
oral presentation, and a final paper.

ES 3036 The History of Natural History
ANDERSON, JOHN
Natural history can be regarded as the oldest science—
indeed, at one point within the Western canon natural
history WAS science. Beginning with discussion of
early hunter-gatherers, working past Ashurbanipal,
King of Kings, Hellenistic Greece, the Roman Empire,
and into the herbals and magicians of the Middle
Ages, this course will survey the development and
eventual fragmentation of natural history into more
specialized branches. Once a foundation has been
established, we will engage with the naturalists of
the great age of exploration and conquest during
the 17th through the 19th centuries, ending with an
examination of natural history’s legacy in the rise of
modern ecology. Course readings will draw heavily on
original sources, using translations where appropriate.
Towards the end of the term we will discuss the
strengths and limitations of inductive and deductive
reasoning in science and the implications of the 20th

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

and 21st centuries’ increased emphasis on theoretical
reasoning. Students will gain a better sense of EuroAmerican history overall and of the history of science
in particular; the ability to use original sources;
understanding of the importance of comparing
multiple sources in arriving at historical conclusions,
and of the importance of recognizing cultural and
historical biases in interpretation of information.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and
the spoken and written presentation of individually
chosen research on a person or topic important to the
development of natural history as a science.

OLDAY, FRED

HUDSON, REUBEN

This companion course to Lichen Biology covers the
biology of the group of land plants known collectively
as bryophytes, which includes the “true” mosses,
as well as the liverworts and hornworts. The course
will cover the classification, morphology, life history,
physiology, and ecological requirements of the various
groups, as well as their rich diversity as directly
experienced by students in the field and laboratory
where emphasis will be given to the collection,
identification, and curation of representative taxa. The
ecology of sphagnum and peat formation will receive
particular attention, since poor fens and bogs are such
a striking feature of the regional vegetation. Two allday field trips are planned. Students will be evaluated
on: (a) class participation, including field trips (20%);
(b) demonstrated capacity for doing independent
work (20%); and (c) a student final project consisting
of a properly identified and curated collection of 30
species of bryophytes excluding taxa identified in
class as part of group keying exercises (60%).

This course explores the physical, chemical, and
environmental properties of carbon-containing
materials such as plastics, solvents,and dyes, as well
as all living things and once-living materials. The
emphasis is on learning fundamental principles that
allow one to understand and to predict the behavior
of various types of organic substances. There is
an optional lab section. Evaluations are based on
midterm and final exam. The equivalent of this course

ES 3061 Functional Plant Morphology
MORSE, SUZANNE
Despite uniform rules of development, seed plants
exhibit an incredible range of forms including
succulent cacti, bug-eating sundews, dainty annuals,
and leafless parasites. These differences in form
often are correlated with habitat and life history
parameters such as nutrient and water availability,
herbivores, light quality, and modes of perennation. In
this course we begin by examining the morphological
development and organization of seed plants from
inception in the seed to reproductive maturity. With
this general developmental framework, we then
examine whole plant and organ level patterns of
variation, modification, and ecological specialization
that underlie the variation in form observed today.
Evaluations are based on laboratory quizzes, paper,
midterm, and final exam.

recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded,
damaged, or destroyed.” In this era of widespread
environmental degradation, restoration ecology
provides an important set of methods for mitigating
anthropogenic damage. However, the science of
restoration is still in its early phases, and important
theoretical and practical questions remain to be
resolved. This class will critically examine the
assumptions that underlie restoration planning, both
in the ethical dimension and in the realm of scientific
theory. We will consider the validity of conceptual
models of ecological communities and ecosystems
and the way that these models shape decision making.
We will survey the factors that must be taken into
account during restoration and study best-practices
approaches, with a focus on adaptive management. In
the final project, groups of students will develop and
present restoration plans for a local site. Students will
be evaluated based on two essays, class participation,

ES 3083 Linear Algebra with Applications
to Differential Equations
FELDMAN, DAVID

ES 3065 Molecular Genetics Workshop
PETERSEN, CHRISTOPHER
This workshop teaches students how to apply and use
a variety of molecular genetic and cellular laboratory
techniques at Mount Desert Island Biological
Laboratory. Students learn how to do basic molecular
genetic techniques, including some subset of DNA
extraction, RNA extraction, PCR, RT-PCR, cloning,
and bioinformatics. Students work on how to carry
out a research design around a specific question, how
to carry out the research and interpret results. The
material will be taught around a research question
that the group will work on for a one-week period over
spring break. The course is taught by various MDIBL
research staff. Successful completion of the workshop
requires attendance for the entire week.

The first half of this class will consist of a rapid tour
of the key elements of linear algebra. We will cover
vector and matrix algebra, linear vector spaces and
subspaces, basis and dimension, the determinant,
and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We will then
consider first-order linear differential equations—first
scalar equations and then systems of equations. We
will see that linear algebra is an indispensable tool
for solving systems of linear differential equations
and understanding the geometric structure of their
solutions. In addition to covering basic theory, we
will consider a handful of case studies that illustrate
the power of the mathematical techniques we are
learning. These case studies will be drawn from across
the sciences. The particular case studies we examine
will depend on student interests.

LETCHER, SUSAN

Students who successfully complete this course
will gain a solid introduction to the calculational
techniques and key constructions and ideas of linear
algebra. Students will also learn techniques for solving
and understanding systems of linear differential
equations. Additionally, this course serves as an
introduction to formal mathematics; students will
gain experience working at a level of generality and
abstraction a bit above that encountered in a typical
introductory calculus sequence. Evaluation will be

ES 3085 Watersheds
HALL, SARAH
In this course students will learn the basic field
and quantitative methods used to characterize
watersheds. The course will focus mainly on
watersheds of Mount Desert Island and some of the
larger rivers in Maine and will build upon foundational
concepts in earth science. The course will feature
field, lab, and lecture components. Students will
conduct geomorphic mapping (field and GIS),
surveying, stream discharge measurements, pebble
counts, and other common tools and methods
to conduct a term-long field study of multiple
island watersheds. Upon returning from the field,
students will use their data to calculate flows and
sediment loads associated with less frequent flood
events. Large magnitude flow events tend to shape
steam channels and have implications for human
infrastructure and intertidal zone dynamics. Students
will be evaluated based on weekly assignments,
quizzes, presentations, and the term-long project.
Students will work in teams to complete a basin-wide
study of one of the island watersheds of interest to
community partners for long-term monitoring. The
field project will culminate in a written report and
presentation. They will work on their project report
throughout the term with opportunities for peer
review and revision. It is strongly recommended
that students have taken high school math courses

ES 3090 Practicum in Sustainable Energy
GIBSON, DAVID

This is a hands-on, project-based class in which
students will collaboratively plan for and participate
in all aspects of renewable energy projects on
College of the Atlantic’s campus. Examples of
projects include installation of a solar photovoltaic
array, airsealing and insulating one of the college’s
buildings, or planning and installing a greenhouse
heating system. Students will learn how to take a
project from design through fruition while navigating
the various phases of the project lifecycle including
operation and maintenance. The course will begin with
an overview of existing technology and an analysis
of the current energy generation and consumption
data for the project site(s). The class will then plan
the project and present this plan to the community.
As part of this planning process, students will learn
about the economics of renewable energy systems,
including ROI (return on investment), IRR (internal
rate of return), and related quantities. Students who
successfully complete this class will gain the skills
necessary to conceptualize, plan for, finance, and
implement renewable energy projects. Evaluation will

ES 3093 Plants and the Urban Environment
LAWLOR, JOSIE
The proportion of people living in cities is increasing
worldwide. As we hasten to make our cities and
towns sustainable in the face of climate change, more
livable and healthy for the world’s population, we will
need to integrate plants more intelligently into our
built environments. Green roofs, rain gardens, and
bioswales are successful examples of highly designed
plant communities that serve multiple functions in the
built environment. Yet, generally, urban landscapes
present challenging and extreme living conditions for
many plants.
In this botany course we examine plant adaptation
to extreme environments. What do alpine plants
have in common with plants in a desert, or beside a
highway? What mechanisms and morphologies enable
plants to withstand heat, drought, or water loss?
With awareness that plants are the foundation of
our own habitat, we explore these questions through
lectures, lab sessions, and field trips to local sites. This
course is intended for students with previous botany
coursework who want to deepen their appreciation of
plants and their adaptations. Evaluations are based
on weekly quizzes, an exam, a field/lab notebook, and
class participation.

ES 3094 Dynamic Landscapes
HALL, SARAH
In this course students will learn to make place-based
observations of landscapes to consider the processes
shaping them. Various climatic and tectonic processes
such as erosion and active mountain building are
continuously shaping Earth’s diverse landscapes.
Humans and other organisms are also shaping and
reshaping the earth’s near surface and have been
for at least thousands of years. We can describe
these geomorphic processes both qualitatively and
quantitatively in order to understand the rates and
timescales over which different landscapes develop
and evolve. Our descriptions and interpretations of
evolving landscapes enable thoughtful interaction and
inhabitation. Students will learn about the processes
forming and shaping landscapes through both the
interpretation of their own local observations as well
as an exploration of prior accounts. We are fortunate
to have a rich record of people’s interactions and
considerations of the landscape of coastal Maine
spanning thousands of years. Students will engage
with different accounts of the regional landscape
through readings, maps, and conversations with
community members. We will also compare aspects of
this region’s iconic glacially carved coastal landscape
with that of other similarly formed landscapes that
are currently located in different geographic, climatic,
tectonic, and built environments and therefore
exposed to different active processes. Students will
learn methods of determining the rates of landscapeshaping processes in order to consider the role of
human activities in landscape change. By combining
different types of temporal and spatial information,
students will learn to identify regional hazards such
as mass-wasting events (landslides, debris flows, rock
falls, etc.), flooding, and coastal erosion. Students will
be evaluated based on their performance on weekly
assignments and a final project in which students
choose one specific coastal Maine location to study.
As we will engage with various materials describing
landscapes throughout the term (i.e. narrative
accounts, maps, scientific reports), this project will be
an opportunity for students to practice place-based
communication. This course will make use of algebra,
GIS-online software, and digital spreadsheets (using
Excel or similar software).

the ways in which plants and animals cope with the
laws of physics, can promote an understanding of
organisms at all levels of organization, from molecules
to ecosystems. In this course we explore several areas
of physical science, including mechanical engineering,
materials science, and fluid dynamics, as a means

ES 4012 Winter Ecology
RESSEL, STEPHEN
In higher latitudes and higher altitudes of the world,
up to nine months of each year can be spent locked
in winter. Although migratory species appear to have
a selective advantage over non-migratory species
during the winter season, year-round resident animals
have evolved a remarkable array of physiological,
morphological, and behavioral adaptations that allow
them to cope with potentially lethal environmental
conditions. In this course, we focus on the special
challenges of animals wintering in northern latitudes.
Some of the topics that we address are: the physical
properties of snow and ice; general strategies of
animals for coping with sub-freezing temperatures;
life in the subnivean environment; animal energetics
and nutrition; physiological acclimatization; and
humans and cold. There are two discussions/lectures
and one field exercise every week, as well as two
weekend field trips. Students should be prepared
to spend a significant amount of time outdoors in
winter conditions. Students are evaluated on class

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

at the last count—and the history and pre-history of
these islands is intimately entwined with that of the
continent itself. This course examines historical and
current interpretations of island biogeography and
the interplay between natural and human history
and human ecology. The class will be taught as a
combination of term-time seminar and in the field,
based on the college’s field station on Great Duck
Island and the college’s research vessel. During the
spring term we will be meeting regularly to examine
the theoretical basis of island biogeography and
islands as the subject of scientific and literary
discussion since Aristotle. Readings will include
Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace, and contemporary
authors. In late August we will re-convene for the
field component of the class. During the first half
of this component, we will be focusing primarily on
Great Duck Island and its immediate surroundings,
learning and applying theoretical approaches to island
landscapes, with extensive reading from the primary
literature. During the second half of the class, we will
move further afield, exploring a variety of islands
in eastern Maine, and relating our observations to
theoretical predictions. Ultimately we hope to travel
to Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy to observe
a large island community, see the traditional weir
fishery, and observe firsthand migrating right and
humpback whales, and northern seabirds. Evaluation

ANDERSON, JOHN
The American West has played a key role in the
development of modern ecology and in our overall
understanding of the natural history of North
America. Researchers such as Joseph Grinnell,
Starker Leopold, Ned Johnson, Phillip Munz, and Jim
Patton contributed enormously to our understanding
of the interactions, distribution, and abundance of
the enormous range of plants and animals occupying
the western states, while the incredible variety of
topography found between the Pacific slope and
Great Basin Desert, containing both the highest and
lowest points in the Lower 48, has provided an ideal
setting for both observation and experimentation.
This intensive field-based course will provide students
with the opportunity to examine first-hand some key
habitats within Nevada, California, and New Mexico,
and to conduct a series of short projects on the
fauna and flora in select sites. Areas to be examined
will include terminal saline lakes, open deserts,
montane meadows, pine forest, riparian hardwoods,

Today this critical interdependence is rich with
questions that are at the center of the food security
and food sovereignty debates. Some questions of this
human-plant co-evolutionary story to be addressed
in this course are: How is crop breeding done in
different parts of the world? What are the techniques
for breeding, seed saving, and storage? What traits
are selected for in traditional and modern breeding?
What role do seed banks and libraries play in our
common future? What are the current laws governing
seed quality and ownership? How do these laws and
treaties structure corporate consolidation, community
initiatives, and possible mechanisms for developing
crops in the face of global climate change? What is
the “free the seed movement” and why might it be
important? The second major debate to be explored
will be the ethical and ecological implications of the
“assisted migration” of wild plants as a means of
conservation and adaptation to global climate change
and the replacement of horticultural materials with
wild plants as means for expanding native habitat
corridors. We will contextualize these two major
themes with an in-depth look into the biology of seeds
as well as the ecological and evolutionary significance
of seeds. In preparation for required attendance at
the Organic Seed Alliance conference, laboratory
exercises will cover seed dormancy and germination,
and build skills in hand pollination and trait selection.
Evaluation will be based on class participation,
leadership in seminar discussions, quizzes, a group
report on the Organic Seed Alliance Conference, and
the development of a final project based on one or
both of themes in the course.

ES 4048 Biostatistics
LETCHER, SUSAN
This course will provide students with a toolbox of
techniques in statistical analysis, with a focus on
the biological sciences. Students will learn how to
choose and apply a variety of widely used statistical
tests, how to design experiments and studies with
statistical analysis in mind, and how to use a range
of specialized statistical approaches for data types
frequently encountered in the biological sciences.
The methods we will cover include: parametric
and nonparametric tests; approaches designed for
categorical, ordinal, and continuous data; biodiversity
statistics and ordination methods; Bayesian vs.
frequentist inference; and robust experimental design.

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

The class will highlight the assumptions involved in
statistical inference and the conditions that must be
met in order to use statistical tests appropriately. In
the lab, students will use the statistical programming
language R to explore, display, and analyze data
using the methods covered in class. By the end of the
term, students should be able to choose appropriate
analytical methods for a wide range of data types,
design statistically valid experiments, and write
code for basic statistical tests in R. Students will be
evaluated based on daily homework assignments,
weekly lab work, several take-home exams, and a final
group presentation based on an original analysis of an
archived data set chosen by the students. Note: each
student should have a laptop for lab (PC preferred;
limited support will be provided for Mac users).
Contact the instructor if you do not have your own
laptop.

(i.e., groups of organisms of the same species),
while community ecology studies the interactions
among populations. We will study classic models in
population and community ecology, developing the
models from first principles, applying them to real
data, and critically examining the shortcomings of
the modeling approach. Concepts to be covered in
the class include exponential vs. logistic population
growth, competition, predator-prey interactions,
metapopulation dynamics, stochastic vs. deterministic
processes, optimal foraging theory, succession,
and behavioral ecology. This course will be useful
for students who are considering graduate school
in ecology and related disciplines, and it is open
to anyone with relevant background knowledge
and curiosity. Students will be evaluated based on
participation in class discussions, a series of problem
sets, and a final paper.

biochemistry. Emphasis will be placed on the flow and
regulation of genetic information from DNA to RNA to
protein, protein composition, structure and function,
enzyme kinetics, metabolic pathways, and sensory
systems. The integration of these key concepts will
be explored through the lens of drugs: mechanism
of action, metabolism in the body, and manipulation
of protein and pathway function. This course should
be especially useful to students with an interest in
medicine, nutrition, physiology, toxicology, genetics,
and pharmacology. This class meets for three hours
of lecture per week; some sessions will include

ES 4053 Ecosystem Ecology
LETCHER, SUSAN
Ecosystem ecology is the branch of ecological
science that considers the large-scale transfer of
matter and energy among different living and nonliving compartments in ecosystems. Thinking about
the natural world with this level of abstraction has
provided critical insights into the processes that
support life on Earth, the feedbacks that connect
the geosphere and atmosphere to the biosphere,
and the ways life is likely to respond to large-scale
perturbations such as climate change. In this course,
we will explore the deep history of life on Earth and
how living things have transformed the chemistry
of the planet. We will study how energy flows and
nutrients cycle in present-day ecosystems, and how
these processes are coupled and regulated by the
actions of living organisms. Using examples from
terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, we will
study how to quantify fluxes of energy and matter. We
will analyze the factors that affect rates of ecosystem
processes such as plant growth and decomposition in
different ecoregions. We will explore the feedbacks
that link living and non-living matter into a single
complex network. The drivers and ramifications of
climate change will be a recurring theme throughout
the term. This course will be useful for students
interested in global change research, particularly
those who plan to pursue graduate degrees in related
fields. Students will be assessed based on class

ES 4059 Advanced Topics in Marine
Mammal Biology

ES 4061 Topics in Scientific Research:
Geoscience and Geochemistry

TODD, SEAN

HALL, SARAH

This class will extend on themes and topics that were
begun in Marine Mammal Biology. In addition to a core
syllabus in marine mammal behavior and physiology,
each student will choose a subject area of focus that
they will pursue individually—such topics could include
molecular science, sound ecology, communication,
and applied conservation issues. Prior to the actual
class, students will undertake a substantial block
of primary literature core readings assigned by the
instructor, in addition to other readings that specialize
in their individual areas of focus. In late August,
students will assemble at the Mount Desert Rock
Marine Research Station and become part of the
resident crew at the station. During this time they will
meet on a daily basis with the instructor for regular
classes; they will also conduct a research project
on the island as a team. Their residency at Mount
Desert Rock will be approximately two weeks. Once
the students have returned to the mainland, they will
continue to work on analyses of data for their project,
as well as individual term papers based on their area
of interest. Evaluation will be based on the team
project and its presentation to a peer community, a
journal/annotated bibliography of their readings, and
a final term paper.

This is a course in conducting scientific research
and practicing scientific communication through
writing and oral presentation. Each student will
spend the term working on one research project that
is part of broader ongoing research by COA faculty
or community-based work in the MDI region. Topics
for student projects will be tied to existing projects
and in collaboration with researchers, educators,
and community members. The projects may follow a
wide range of formats and should connect to student
interests. Some examples of possible projects include:
investigating seasonal variation in surface water and
groundwater quality and quantity, identifying the
resource needs of high school educators teaching data
literacy based on geoscience datasets, interpreting
the paleoecology of a location based on a sediment
core, exploration of geochemical reactions, analyzing
levels of contamination in the environment, or the
review and synthesis of the state of EPA standards
for the acceptable limits for chemicals found in
drinking water. After choosing a project, students
will ask questions of existing data, review existing
literature, design the next phase of a project, collect
observations, and make interpretations based on
those observations. Each week, students will practice
writing and peer review of project components:
proposal preparation, literature review, methodology
description, presentation of results or products, data
visualization, interpretation and synthesis connected
to prior work, and potential future work. Class time
will be used for lectures, meetings with visiting
collaborators or field trips, student presentations,
and writing instruction and revision. Students will be
evaluated based on their weekly written work, their
ability to meet milestones throughout the project
work, and their final dissemination (report and oral
presentation) of their project.

ES 4060 Mammalogy
ANDERSON, JOHN
This class will examine the anatomy, physiology,
ecology, and evolutionary history of the class
Mammalia. Beginning with the evolutionary origin
of the first mammals in the Triassic we will follow
the adaptive radiation within the group, and the
development of increasingly specialized organisms
in response to changing climactic and biological
conditions. During the final portion of the course, we
will examine current theories of hominid evolution
and the effects of human dispersal patterns on
mammalian biodiversity. Lab work will focus on the
identification of North American mammals, but we
will also take advantage of other specimens as they
become available. Evaluation based on a series of
quizzes, a lab practical, and a term project focusing
on one family of mammals. Three hours of lecture/

ES 4062 Applied Data Science II
SHANK, KYLE S
Applied Data Science II is a continuation of the themes
and topics covered in Applied Data Science I. Whereas
Applied Data Science I focused on data cleaning,
COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

organization, and visualization, Applied Data Science
II will be focused on building quantitative models
from data and using those models for predictive
purposes. This would be a great class for those
interested in a deeper, more focused exploration of
modeling within data science and how those skills
can be applied across a wide variety of fields. We’ll
focus on three major areas of application: (1) practical,
field-invariant skills for building complex models
from data; (2) understanding, designing, and building
predictive models (as opposed to other types such
as inferential); and (3) understanding, designing,
and building models that rely on various types of
statistical learning (also known as machine learning)
to produce results. Leaving this class, students will be
able to immediately apply these modeling skills to a
broad array of interests and topic areas. For example,
students should have the skills necessary to build
predictive models for population sizes in ecological
settings based upon field data, or students should be
able to build a machine learning-based classification
model for whether or not a given student will attend
ACM in a given week. We will also take special note to
cover areas of ethical concern that arise when using
predictive and machine learning models. Classes will
be taught as a mix of live coding exercises, lectures,
and group discussions. Prior familiarity with the
R programming language and statistics—such as
building linear models and hypothesis testing—are
required. Students will need to use either their
personal laptop or a COA loaner laptop for class and
programming exercises. Evaluation will be through
class participation and discussion, several data
modeling exercises, and a final project. The data
modeling exercises will take the form of written
analyses of several well-known data sets as well as
investigations of synthetic ones created specifically
for the course. The final project will take the form of
an oral presentation of an analysis. This can be either
done in a group or as an individual and may be of any
topic of sufficient interest to the student(s) involved.

ES 4063 Analytical Chemistry
HUDSON, REUBEN
This course will focus heavily on field sampling
(primarily lake sediment coring), technical
field skills (canoeing, knot tying, camping) and
laboratory processing of the collected samples
(extraction, analysis, selection). This course will
cover a variety of analytical techniques including
gas chromatography mass spectrometry (analysis
of biomarkers from human habitation preserved in
lake sediment cores), inductively coupled plasma
atomic absorption (heavy metal analysis in sediment
samples), thermogravimetric analysis (to determine
organic and carbonate content of soil and sediment

samples) and 14C dating. For each type of analysis,
students will learn the technique’s theory, followed
by hands-on laboratory practice. Students will be
evaluated based on participation in field sampling, lab
processing, and lecture discussions, as well as through
regular problem sets and a term-long writing project.
Although field sampling will be a major component
of the course, students do not need to have any prior
experience with technical field skills; we will teach the
necessary field skills as part of the course. Students
will need waterproof shoes, raingear (rain pants and
raincoat) and appropriate layers for (synthetic or
wool) for spending prolonged periods of time outside.
If students do not have their own personal gear we
can provide it for them if we are informed by the
start of the course. All technical equipment (canoes,
lifejackets, coring equipment) will be provided.

marine mammals. The course includes a general
description of the key physiological systems, and
the most common diseases and health threats
to marine mammals as well as the role of marine
mammal health in changing ocean ecosystems.
Practical classes include an introduction to the
incident command structure, marine mammal
necropsy technique, sample collection, and the role
of necropsy investigation in marine mammal research
and stranding response. These dissection classes
also provide the material to review the link between

This field-based course will introduce students to
the immense diversity of amphibians and reptiles of
Central America. Students will meet weekly during
the term to read and discuss aspects of the taxonomy,
systematics, ecology, behavior, and biogeography of
species native to Costa Rica but the major emphasis
of the course will be on-site instruction and fieldwork
within Costa Rica. Students will travel to several
field stations located in different bioclimatic zones,
spending extensive time in the field learning the
herpetofauna of each region through observation
and application of field techniques. Non-travel days
will typically consist of early morning to early/
mid-afternoon field time, afternoon lectures or

ANDERSON, JOHN

ES 5038 Tutorial: Ecology and Evolution of
Parasites
HESS, HELEN
Parasites live on the surface or within the bodies of
a host, feeding off host fluids or tissues. Because
parasites do not directly kill the host, a parasitic
infection may persist indefinitely, sometimes decades
in the case of long-lived hosts. Parasites include
tiny, single-celled organisms as well as worms that
can reach many meters in length. This course will
explore the biology of parasites, with a focus on those
species that affect humans and domestic animals.
Some of the most prevalent human diseases, such as
malaria and schistosomiasis, are caused by parasites.
Students will learn about the evolution o f complex life
histories and the various means of evading the host’s
immune system employed by parasites. We will meet
twice a week for lecture and discussion of reading
from the primary literature as well as the popular
literature. Students will take turns presenting material
on specific issues and examples they have research.

This is a course in Ornithology in the traditional
sense: a literature and lab-based assessment of the
evolution, taxonomy, and structure of Class Aves.
We will begin with an overview of the evolutionary
diversification of birds, discuss unique adaptations
that have allowed this group of vertebrates to spread
across the entire planet, and then examine details
of physiology and anatomy, including reproduction,
developmental biology and feeding and locomotion.
We will explore both current and historical literature
in bird behavior, with occasional guest lectures from
authors of some papers we discuss. A strong interest
in taxonomy is assumed. Labs will include dissection,
some microscopy, and observation of behavior.

and discussing both primary literature and review
papers covering the ecology and evolution of marine
organisms. Students will read papers, provide short
written responses before class, and have two small
synthetic problem sets or essays over this portion
of the term. The second half of the term students
will divide their time between a large class project
and small group projects, with projects largely
based in the local intertidal community. Much of this
fieldwork will be tide dependent and occur outside
of the listed classroom time. Projects may include
the population biology and ecology of introduced
species, intraspecific variation in morphology and
behavior, using eDNA or individual barcoding to help
determine local species composition, and estimates of
biodiversity in local habitats. Students will also take
part in an applied class project aimed at assisting
with the management and monitoring of locally comanaged species, clams, and alewives.

HUMAN ECOLOGY
HE 1010 Human Ecology Core Course
STAFF
Human ecology is the interdisciplinary study of the
relationships between humans and their natural and
cultural environments. The purpose of this course is
to build a community of learners that explores the
question of human ecology from the perspectives of
the arts, humanities, and sciences, both inside and
outside of the classroom. By the end of the course
students should be familiar with how differently these
three broad areas ask questions, pose solutions, and
become inextricably intertwined when theoretical
ideas are put into practice. In the end, we want
students to be better prepared to create their own
human ecology degree through a more in-depth
exploration of the courses offered at College of the
Atlantic. We will approach this central goal through a
series of directed readings and activities.

HUMAN STUDIES
HS 0958 Introduction to Academic Writing
CASS, BLAKE
Introduction to Academic Writing introduces students

not only to writing as process—prewriting, writing, and
rewriting—but also to resources that aid students in
writing successfully in an academic setting. Students
will meet weekly as a class and individually with the
instructor and/or peer tutor. They will also meet with
library staff who will introduce students to the range
of online resources available and how best to access
them. Both the writing and speaking assignments are
based on assignments in other courses, particularly
the Human Ecology Core Course. Since writing is a
maturation process, evaluations are based on the
student’s growth as a writer, participation in class
discussions and peer review sessions, and ability
to meet deadlines. This course may be taken either
for credit or non-credit, and prepares students to
successfully take Writing Seminar I and II, Introduction
to Journalism, Communicating Science, and any of the

CLINE, KEN
The law affects every aspect of human activity.
As human ecologists we must garner some basic
understanding of how law is used (or misused) to
shape society and human behavior. This course
examines two aspects of the American legal system:
1) the judicial process or how we resolve disputes;
and 2) the legislative process or how we enact policy.
Course readings cover everything from classic
jurisprudence essays to the daily newspaper. We use
current environmental and social issues to illustrate
specific applications of the legal process. Legal brief
preparation, mock courtroom presentations, lobbying
visits to the Maine legislature, and guest lectures are
used to give a practical dimension to course subjects.

HS 1014 Feminist Theory in a Transnational
Frame I
VAN VLIET, NETTA
This course introduces students to some of the
central texts and genealogies of feminist thought,
with a focus on transnational feminist theory. We will
address periods of feminist thought that have been
significant in shaping the concerns of transnational
feminisms, including 1970s US feminism, French
feminism, postcolonial theory, and Marxist thought.
Over the course of the term, we will consider how
differences across national borders have informed
discussions about transnational feminist solidarity.
We will examine how feminist theory can help us think
about the following: kinship; reproduction; the law and
justice; human rights discourse; political economy;
racialization and other forms of difference; existence
and the subject; the relation between individual and
group; the relation between terms such as “gender”
and “sex;” and the varied currencies the terms
“queer” and “feminist” have carried in different
national and transnational contexts.
The course will explicitly address debates in
feminist theory about the following topics: the sex/
gender distinction; histories and politics of the
term “rape;” political representation, the juridical
and the nation-state in the contexts of religious
and cultural differences around practices such
as veiling, circumcision/genital mutilation; and
questions of labor, prostitution, and sex work. The
course draws on work in French feminist theory,
queer theory, postcolonial studies, psychoanalysis,

the American conservation movement from the
1600s through the present. Through an examination
of historical accounts and contemporary analysis,
students develop an understanding of the issues,
places, value conflicts, and people who have shaped
conservation and environmental policy in the United
States. They also gain an appreciation for the
relationship between the conservation movement and
other social and political movements. Students should
come away with a sense of the historical and cultural
context of American attitudes toward nature. We also
seek to apply these lessons to policy debates currently
underway in Maine. Working from original writings,
students do in-depth research on a selected historical
figure. Evaluation is based on problem sets, group
activities, participation, and a final paper.

HS 1032 Acadia: Exploring the National
Park Idea
CLINE, KEN
Using Acadia National Park as a case study, this
course will explore the various facets of the national
park idea, and what it means for Americans in terms
of history and identity. Through direct experiences
in one of the crown jewels of the park system, the
class will examine the historical, ecological, cultural,
social, legal, economic, and spiritual context in which
national parks are formed and continue to exist in
the 21st century. We will work with National Park
Service professionals to look at various aspects of
park management and day-to-day challenges of
implementing the national park idea. Through weekly
field trips, journaling, service learning opportunities,
and projects, we will be immersed in the management
and experience of Acadia. We will explore, through
reading and writing, the broader themes of wilderness
preservation, attitudes toward nature, the history of
conservation, and the commodification of nature. This

HS 1042 Globalization/Anti-Globalization
VAN VLIET, NETTA
The terms globalization and anti-globalization are
often used to refer to increasing cultural homogeneity
across the globe, but also to growing familiarity with
multiple forms of diversity and intercultural exchange.
These terms also reference notions of progress
and development, but also increasing poverty and
inequality. In this course, we will look at how historical
perspectives of the forces of globalization— including
capitalism, European modernity and its colonial
histories —shape contemporary understandings of,
and debates over, immigration, labor, gender and
ethnic differences, national boundaries and their
transgression, the law, justice, and human rights. We
will think critically about concepts such as agency,
freedom, and even the notion of the human itself.
Relatedly, this course will challenge you to think
about the implications of how difference—national,
gender, ethnic, and otherwise—is understood in
terms of globalization for political problems such
as war, poverty, environmental destruction, sexual
violence, imperialism, and freedom of movement
and expression. Over the course of the term, we will
examine how human relations in specific locales are
shaped through economic and cultural exchanges,
mass media, different forms of representation and
changing means of mobility. To this end, we will
draw on specific examples from African, European,
Middle Eastern and Latin American contexts. This is
an interdisciplinary course that draws on the fields
of anthropology, literature, feminist theory, and

we will be reading from novels, engaging with film,
and listening to music. Evaluation of students will be

one midterm paper and one final paper, and class
participation.

HS 1046 Introduction to Economics and the
Economy
TAYLOR, DAVIS
This course provides students with an introduction
to both economic theory and the historical and
institutional background needed to understand the
context, functioning, and trajectory of 21st century
economies. On the theoretical side, students will
be introduced to explanations of the economic
behavior of individuals and firms (microeconomics)
and the workings of national economies and
money (macroeconomics), including economic
development and international topics such as trade
and exchange rates. In addition to the standard
neoclassical approaches to these topics, we will
also introduce behavioral, feminist, Marxist, and
ecological economics perspectives. Complementing
these theoretical approaches will be a rich immersion
in historical and institutional themes such as the
history of capitalism, the rise of corporations, the
institutional background of markets for stocks,
bonds, and derivatives, inequality and poverty,
state-led capitalism (e.g. as seen in China and Brazil)
and the events that led up to recent financial crises
in the United States and Europe. Evaluation will be
based on bi-weekly problem sets, a final exam, and
various forms of classroom participation. Learning
will be facilitated by a weekly lab session that will be
scheduled the first week of the term.

HS 1052 Ethnographic Methods
VAN VLIET, NETTA
Ethnographic research is based primarily on
anthropology’s signature research method, known
as participant-observation fieldwork. This course
introduces students to the main techniques,
questions, insights and debates that this research
method has historically involved in the formation of
the discipline of anthropology, and the contemporary
relevance of these questions and debates for a range
of ethnographic and interdisciplinary projects. Over
the term, students will view ethnographic films and
read classic and contemporary ethnographic texts, as
well as social and political theory that has informed
ethnography. The course will address questions about
84

representation, authenticity, experience, evidence,
familiarity and difference, place and time, the
everyday and the extraordinary, politics and ethics.
Students will be asked to participate in the central
methods of ethnographic research including taking
fieldnotes, conducting formal and informal interviews
with both familiar others and with strangers,
formulating a research question, and analyzing
qualitative data. Assignments will include informal
reading responses, a midterm mini-field project, and
a final mini-field project that builds on the midterm.
Evaluation will be based on these assignments and
on class participation and final presentations of their
projects.

HS 1053 Intimate Partner Violence:
Dynamics and Community Response
GAGNON DA SILVA, PAMELA
From a historical perspective domestic violence
has been noted as primarily a “women’s issue.” We
now recognize the misuse of power and control in
relationships as a complex and prevalent social issue
that profoundly impacts our society as a whole. To
address the complexity of domestic violence we
must strive toward changing the belief systems that
allow this problem to exist. Together we will explore
these belief systems by examining the aspects of
culture that shape and support domestic violence
on individual, community, institutional, and global
levels. We will review the history of the domestic
violence movement, including its roots in the women’s
movement and how that movement grew into a
network of victim-centered services and communitybased advocacy responses. As a student you will
learn how best to respond to victims of intimate
partner violence, and how to apply the core principles
of individual, community, institutional, and social
change advocacy. You will be challenged to consider
and reflect upon your own beliefs and cultural lenses
throughout the course. The class format includes
lectures, roleplays, media presentations, interviews
with guest speakers, group work, and discussions.
Opportunities will be provided for students to reflect
upon experiences, to practice skills, and to apply new
learning through community and cultural change
projects. Students will be evaluated on their critical
thinking, analysis, and synthesis of the course goals
and objectives as demonstrated by participation
in class activities (responsiveness to required and
suggested readings and materials, guest and peer
generated discussion) and personal culture analysis
(personal reflection, self-evaluation).

HS 1054 Climate Justice
STABINSKY, DOREEN
Climate change is one of the biggest and most difficult
challenges faced by contemporary societies. The
challenge has multiple facets: environmental, social,
political, economic—each with its own complexities.
This course focuses primarily on the social, political
and economic components of the climate problem,
framed by the concept of climate justice. In the
course students are introduced to basic conceptions
of justice, the latest findings of climate science
and possible impacts on regional scales, and the
global politics of climate change, principally in the
context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change. Climate justice and its operationalization
is the principal organizing theme for work over the
term, addressing questions such as: how the costs of
climate change impacts and efforts to address climate
change could or should be distributed between rich
and poor, global north and global south; and what are
the possible means whereby those costs might be
addressed through collective action at various levels—
local, national, and global. Students will be evaluated
based on regular quizzes, several short papers, class
participation, and a final synthetic paper or project.

HS 1062 Problems and Dilemmas in
Bioethics
LAKEY, HEATHER
Bioethics studies ethical problems that occur in
medical practice and the life sciences. Contemporary
bioethics is an expansive and fundamentally
interdisciplinary field, but this course will consider
key dilemmas in bioethics from a philosophical
perspective. We will begin by reviewing dominant
ethical frameworks, including teleological ethics,
deontological ethics, utilitarianism, natural law
theory, and virtue ethics. Next, we will discuss specific
ethical issues such as, abortion, euthanasia and
physician-assisted suicide, life-sustaining treatments,
resource allocation, cloning, biotechnologies, animal
research, and informed consent, and the doctorpatient relationship. In particular, we will consider how
different ethical frameworks shape our assessment
of specific ethical dilemmas. My goal in this course
is to introduce students to the principles of ethical
thinking, to familiarize students with pressing debates
in bioethics, and to consider how ethical thinking
impacts our response to issues that are politically and
socially contentious. Course requirements include
class participation, an in-class presentation, a midterm
exam, and a final paper.

HS 1064 College Seminar: Practical Skills in
Community Development
BEARD, RONALD
In rural areas throughout the world, citizens,
nonprofit leaders, agency staff, and elected officials
are coming together to frame complex issues and
bring about change in local policy and practice. This
course outlines the theory and practice of community
development, drawing on the instructor’s experience
with the Dùthchas Project for sustainable community
development in the highlands and islands of Scotland,
Mount Desert Island Tomorrow, and other examples
in the literature. In short, community development
allows community members to frame issues, envision
a preferred future, and carry out projects that move
the community toward that preferred future. By using
writing as process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting—
to frame and communicate complex public issues,
students gain practical skills in listening, designing
effective meetings, facilitation, project planning and
developimng local policy. Readings, discussions, and
guests introduce students to community development
theory and practice. Class projects are connected to
community issues on Mount Desert Island. By writing
and revising short papers, students can reflect on
class content, community meetings, newspaper
stories, and reading assignments. Evaluation will be
based on preparation for and participation in class
discussion, several short papers, participation in
field work, and contribution to a successful group
project. This class meets the first-year writing course
requirement.

HS 1065 Philosophies of Good and Evil
LAKEY, HEATHER
Good and evil are timeless topics and they have
motivated centuries of philosophical thinking.
Although the terms “good” and “evil” are commonly
used across a range of discourses, they are
ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In
an effort to clarify our ideas about good and evil,
this course provides a broad overview of the issues,
arguments, and debates that shape philosophical
ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What
are the origins of good and evil? What makes an
action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What
should we do with someone who commits a horrific
act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? Is evil
an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of
good and evil help or hinder moral thinking?
To critically explore the concepts of rightness,
wrongness, goodness, and badness, we will move
between fiction and philosophical treatises. We will
read works by key thinkers including St. Augustine,
Niccolo Machiavelli, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich

Nietzsche, Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre,
Simone de Beauvoir, Flannery O’Connor, James
Baldwin, William Golding, Sherman Alexie, Rosalind
Hursthouse, and Cornel West. Along the way, we will
study deontology, utilitarianism, natural law ethics,
virtue ethics, ethical relativism, feminist ethics,
existentialism, and nihilism. In addition, we will unpack
the ethical arguments that orbit concrete topics such
as execution, murder, abortion, moral character, racial
injustice, pornography, prostitution, duties to animals,
and our duties to one another.
This course will familiarize students with the
influential frameworks of moral philosophy, and it will
encourage students to apply these frameworks to
specific moral problems. Students will be evaluated
on class participation, weekly writing assignments, a
midterm exam, a final paper, and a presentation.
Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: None, but students
should be prepared to engage difficult, philosophical
texts and to discuss these texts in class. Class

PEÑA, KARLA
This course is for students who have some
acquaintance with general ideas, basic expressions,
and vocabulary of the Spanish language but lack
grammatical structures and development of the
basic language abilities of speaking, writing, and
listening comprehension skills. Objective: Students
will express themselves orally and through writing,
using vocabulary and simple construction of Spanish
in the indicative tense. This includes present tense
study, vocabulary, numbers, proper nouns, salutations
and presentations, present perfect tense, action
verbs, the use of “to be” and “is,” future tense,
vocabulary, and some use of “for.” Evaluation criteria:
two compositions, two auditory tests, two writing
tests covering grammar, two oral tests, assignments/
homework, class participation.

HS 1075 Animals and Ethics
LAKEY, HEATHER
This discussion-based course will explore philosophical
and ethical questions pertaining to the relationships
between humans and non-human animals. We will
read a wide range of fiction, philosophical essays, and
ethical arguments in order to articulate and unpack
our beliefs, assumptions, and understandings of
animals, human-animal relations, and the implications
and consequences of the human-animal binary.
This course will focus on a wide range of theoretical
approaches, including the tradition of animals rights
86

and animal liberation as articulated by thinkers such
as Peter Singer, the growing field of animal studies
as represented by thinkers like Donna Haraway and
Kari Weil, as well as texts rooted in the tradition of
Continental philosophy which includes thinkers like
Derrida, Agamben, and Irigaray.
This course is premised on the following questions:
What are our moral obligations to other animals?
Should non-human animals have legal rights and moral
standing? If so, on what basis? How does the moral
treatment of animals change across the contexts of
food, research, captivity, and the home? Do we have
different ethical obligations to wild and domestic
animals? Historically, western philosophers construct
the “animal” in opposition to the human. Why? What
is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted
with it? How do we use the concept of the “animal”
to delimit our concept of the “human”? How does
language shape and produce our relationships with
animals? Upon complete of the course, students will
have refined their understanding of the concept of the
“animal” and they will be familiar with the key legal and
ethical debates regarding human-animal relationships.
Course requirements include class discussion, weekly
writing exercises, a midterm exam, and a research
project focusing on a human-animal relationship
somewhere in Maine. Students should come to this
class prepared to engage challenging philosophical
essays and to share their ideas with others.

HS 1076 College Seminar: Truth
COX, GRAY
What is the opposite of “fake news”? Does science
have the power—or the right—to tell us where we
came from or what the future of our climate will be?
Are there such things as universal human rights or
ethical norms that are independent of the prejudices
of individual people or cultures? Do intuitions or
emotions give us higher truths than rationality?
Can computers with Big Data discover truths that
are inaccessible to mere humans? This course will
explore these and related questions about what
“truth” might mean, what forms it might take, how
we might arrive at it, and how it might inform our
public politics and private lives. It will look at a mix of
classic and contemporary short texts that exemplify
good writing about these general questions. It will
also look at current cases and applications of these
ideas in the news of the day. Using a college seminar
format, the course will emphasize the writing process
to practice skills to formulate, thoughtfully analyze,
and revise views about these issues. The course goals
are to develop student skills in the critical analysis
of arguments and texts and to increase skills in
writing clear expositions and persuasive prose. It will

include some reading materials and in-class exercises
to explore alternative writing processes. Course
assignments will include brief homework activities,
short papers with revised versions of each, and one
longer research paper providing an extended revision
of an earlier piece. Students will be evaluated based
on the extent to which their class participation,
homework, and writing assignments demonstrate
substantive progress on the course goals. Class
sessions will alternate between seminar discussions,
short lectures, and peer review sessions of papers.

HS 1077 Ethnographic Writing
VAN VLIET, NETTA
Ethnographic writing, literally the “writing of a
people,” is anthropology’s primary disciplinary mode
of representation, based on participant-observation
fieldwork. Early ethnographies were usually written by
European and American anthropologists about people
they had studied in far away places. In the 1970s and
on, critical questions about representation began
to challenge assumptions about ethnographic work,
raising questions about objectivity, transparency, and
the relationship of the ethnographer to the people
and place about which they are writing. This class will
introduce students to a range of ethnographies in the
discipline of anthropology, as well as to the political,
cultural, and intellectual contexts in which these
ethnographies were produced. At the same time, we
will consider epistemological, ethical, philosophical,
and methodological issues that such writing involves,
including questions about representation and
interpretation. In addition to classic ethnographies,
we will also read some fiction, travel writing, and
journalism. We will consider questions about
how ethnographic knowledge is authorized, how
assumptions about interpretation shape ethnographic
writing, and the relationship between author and
reader. Students will be asked to experiment with
ethnographic writing themselves, through a series of
short writing assignments as well as a final project.
The course is designed to allow students to workshop
their own writing. Students will be evaluated on the
development and improvement of their own writing
over the course of the term, as well as on their ability
to critically evaluate and closely read ethnographies
as texts, and on their engagement with their peers’
writing, considering elements such as authorial
voice, the nature of characterization, and the overall
movement of a text.

HS 1084 College Seminar: Utopia/Dystopia

LAKEY, HEATHER
The practice of social dreaming has a long history in
philosophical thinking, stretching back to Hesiod and
Plato. What constitutes a perfect or ideal society?
Or, if no such place is possible, what makes for a
well-functioning society? Likewise, what constitutes
a terrible society? What kind of places and spaces
do we want to avoid? These are important questions
for human ecologists to ask as we seek to improve
our relationships with our natural, social, and
technological environments. To explore questions
of ideal and flawed places, this course studies the
concepts of utopia and dystopia across a range of
philosophical, political, and literary writings. Although
we will focus our attention on theoretical literature,
we will read several novels and short stories, and
students will present research on a work of utopian or
dystopian fiction.
Additional course questions include: What motivates
us to envision utopias and dystopias? Does political
philosophy require a utopian vision? What do utopias
and dystopias tell us about social fears, anxieties, and
hopes? Course readings will focus on classical Greek
thought, Enlightenment thought, political theory, and
critical theory. Texts may include Plato’s Republic,
Thomas More’s Utopia, Marx and Engels’ Communist
Manifesto, William Godwin’s Enquiry Concerning
Political Justice, Sigmund Freud’s Civilization and
Its Discontents, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland,
Octavia Butler’s Blood Child, Ursula K. LaGuin’s
The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, Hannah
Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, George
Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and selections from
The Utopian Reader by Gregory Claeys and Lyman
Tower Sargent. Since this course is being offered as
a college seminar and will meet the first-year writing
requirement, we will focus on writing as process—
prewriting, writing, and rewriting. As students draft
bi-weekly writing assignments, they will meet with
the professor or TA either individually or as part of a
weekly writing lab. Papers will be peer reviewed and
each student will be expected to revise each paper. In
addition to bi-weekly papers, there will be an in-class
presentation, a midterm exam, and a final paper.

HS 1085 Introduction to Sexual Health
MAGNUSON, MADALYNNE
This multidisciplinary course will explore a breadth
of human sexuality topics drawing from public
health theories, prevention education practices,
feminist scholarship, and queer activism. Prevention
education promotes the knowledge, attitudes, and
skills necessary for a sexually healthy population and
seeks to prevent the spread of disease and violence.
In addition to educating individuals in how to engage

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

87

in health promoting behaviors, effective prevention
education takes into consideration cultures that
inhibit or facilitate health. Prevention education
supports policies, practices, and norms that create an
environment where all populations can thrive.
The World Health Organization defines sexual health
as, “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social
well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the
absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual
health requires a positive and respectful approach
to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the
possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual
experiences free from coercion, discrimination and
violence.” With this definition in mind we will discuss
topics including sexual health and reproduction,
sexual identity, intimacy, sensuality, and sexualization.
Sources of discussion may include the socialecological model of health, theories from 20th
century sex researchers such as William Masters and
Virginia Johnson, tactics of sexual health activists
such as ACT UP, feminist writers such as Audre Lorde,
and web-based sex education platforms such as
Afrosexology and Amaze. From discussions students
can expect to examine their personal attitudes, gain
up-to-date knowledge and resources, and grow their
skills for promoting sexual health in their lives and
communities. This course may be most helpful for
students interested in working in the fields of sexual
and interpersonal violence prevention, HIV prevention,
or reproductive health. Students will be evaluated
based on class participation, two papers, and a final
project. This is an online course and will be taught
using platforms for synchronous and asynchronous
discussions.

HS 1086 The Poet’s Profession: An
Introduction to Poetry
LEWIS, RHIANNON
What kind of work is writing poetry? How do poets
construct verse through diction, imagery, and
technical elements? This introductory course traces
the development of the poetic vocation and poetic
form through Western literature. We will focus on how
poets writing in English from the 14th century onward
have worked to establish their profession, drawing on
classical tradition to define a new social and economic
role. We will also investigate how social, political,
economic, and linguistic developments, such as the
Industrial Revolution, Great Depression, movements of
the 1960s, and rise of internet culture, have informed
what it means to be a poet in our society. Reading
selections of poetry from medieval and early modern
periods through the present will enable us to study
how socioeconomics, race, gender, and assumptions
about the nature of work shape who has historically
been eligible for and excluded from the profession.
88

Evaluation is based on two short papers, weekly
response papers, and class participation. Students
are encouraged to consider poetry broadly, including
spoken word, song, and concrete poetry, and to
explore other national poetic traditions in assignments
and class discussions.

HS 1091 Introduction to Feminist Therapy:
Practices and Principles
GAGNON DA SILVA, PAMELA
Feminist therapy is focused on empowerment through
self-awareness and self-assertion as shaped by
an understanding of the larger social and political
constructs that influence our thoughts and behaviors.
In practice the application of feminist therapy
synthesizes tenets of gender-based psychology,
psychosocial theories of lifespan development,
multicultural analysis, and applied social change
activism with the objective of self evolution in relation
to personal, social, political, and cultural exchanges.
This course offers an overview of the origins and
applications of feminist therapy as a conceptual
framework developed in response to androcentric
therapies. We will begin by acknowledging the
forerunners of feminist therapy such as Karen Horney
and Leta Stetter Hollingworth. We will continue
studying the contributions of contemporary feminist
therapists such as Ellyn Kaschak, Lenore E. Walker,
Jean Baker Miller, and Laura Brown, including
prominent contributions by women of color in clinical
psychology such as the work of Ruth Winifred Howard
and Ellen Kitch Childs, and those who are currently
pioneering the development of women’s psychology
in other countries such as Vindhya Undurti. We
will explore the core principles of feminist therapy,
and the influences and implications of power and
gender biases at play in clinical practice throughout
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Students
will have the opportunity to learn about feminist
therapeutic techniques.
The objective of the course is to aid students in
developing a functional knowledge of feminist therapy
and its various clinical applications. Students who
have a desire to pursue psychotherapy and social work
are encouraged to consider this course as a means of
understanding the benefit of feminist therapy in the
development of egalitarian therapeutic relationships.
The class format includes lectures, roleplays, media
presentations, interviews with guest speakers, group
work, and discussions. Opportunities will be provided
for students to reflect upon experiences, to practice
skills, and apply learning through a community
project.
Students will be evaluated on their critical thinking,
analysis, and synthesis of the course goals and
objectives as demonstrated by participation in class

HS 1092 This Place Called India
TANEJA, PALAK
What is the first thing that comes to mind when
you hear the words “India,” “Bollywood,” “Curry,”
“Poverty?” The way we encounter a place/space and
form an opinion about it has a lot to do with the kind
of popular cultural representations that float around
with the power to perpetuate (or dispel) stereotypes.
Literature, for example, offers a fertile ground to
explore the idea of a place like India. Therefore, this
class will be your literary introduction to India in its
diversity. Students will be evaluated based on class
participation, along with written assignments and
a multimodal presentation. So, by producing wellthought-out and carefully researched responses,
movie reviews, presentations, and more, you will get
to engage with various aspects of India. We will be
studying works by Jhumpa Lahiri, William Dalrymple,
Anita Desai, among others. These literary texts and
additional materials like films, food, advertisements,
and newspaper reports will be a means to study the
politics of history, location, image, identity, diaspora,
gender, and (mis)representations. The main purpose
of this class is to help you use literature to develop
your own idea of this place called India.

HS 1094 Public Speaking Workshop
RAND, KENDRA
Consider all the ways that public speaking could
be a part of your academic and professional paths:
presenting your research; sitting on a webinar panel;
speaking up at ACM; advocating for an urgent cause
or policy; preparing your senior project presentation;
delivering a formal address at a special occasion; or
even deciding to perform spoken word at an open
mic. This course will prepare you to thoughtfully
analyze your audience, research and organize relevant
information, and deliver the critically important,
well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.
Along the way we will be guided by, and critically
analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory
premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of
formal, standard presentation/speech delivery; that
it’s equally important to respect and refine your own
unique, authentic voice and speech communication
style; and that important change happens when we

both listen carefully and speak up loudly. This class
will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on
students producing increasingly advanced speeches
for public performance and/or consumption. Students
will complete three graded, formal presentations
while also considering additional creative approaches
and formats for public communication. Students
will work with a variety of short texts and videos
to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking
habits. The real benefits of this course come from the
positive, supportive environment in which students
can practice new public speaking skills and learn from
each other. This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic,
hands-on approach to constructing speeches.
Students who feel that they are less proficient in the
area of public communication should not be worried
that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms
of their overall evaluation. All students, regardless
of their levels of comfort, experience, or and Englishproficiency are encouraged to consider this course.
This workshop is designed to help you improve your
public presentation skills regardless of whether you
are a complete novice to public speaking, or already

HS 1095 Introduction to Postcolonialism
TANEJA, PALAK
This course will engage with postcolonialism as a field
of academic inquiry and culture critique in a globalized
world, especially as a tool to analyze postcolonial
literature. We seek to understand how multiple
histories and different aspects of colonialism inform
the content and form of the fiction we read and our
lives today. Postcolonialism, with its interdisciplinary
approach, offers a lens to look at imperial literature
and the new literature produced in the former
colonies of Africa, South Asia, the Caribbean, and
the like. The course will begin with a brief history
and exploration of the word “postcolonial” before
moving on to look at some of the significant issues
and intersections in the field, such as the questions
of language, nation, gender, and otherness, among
others. The texts by Chinua Achebe, Salman Rushdie,
Jean Rhys, accompanied by theorists like Frederic
Jameson, Aijaz Ahmad, and Gayatri Spivak, will create
a balance where we will use the theoretical pieces
as a lens to read and parse out the major and, in
some senses, representative postcolonial texts. You
will be evaluated on class participation and written
assignments like discussion posts, a book review, an
annotated bibliography, and a short paper.

HS 1096 Introduction to Art Therapy
CHERMAK, HILARY
Not all people are able to talk about their feelings,
some people need to express them. Introduction to
Art Therapy is designed to introduce undergraduates
to the philosophical, pragmatic, and historical
foundations of the human service field of art therapy.
Art processes have been used successfully in almost
all psychotherapeutic contexts, ranging from work
with those who are severely ill to the facilitation
of mindfulness. Art therapy continues to grow in
communities to bring personal healing to mental,
emotional, and physical health concerns. Art therapy
is used in educational settings, hospitals, hospice,
corporations, and community art projects, especially
after traumatic events. The intellectual framework
and methodologies of art and psychotherapy will be
outlined and discussed within the course lessons.
Class discussions will stimulate integrated thinking
and provide a platform to reflect on personal growth.
Specific art directives will give you an opportunity
to be creative and strengthen your understanding of
art therapy. A weekly visual journal will be required
(prompts will be given). Lecture, discussion, audiovisual presentation, and experiential exercises
creating expressive art comprise the structure of
the class. Evaluations are based on two papers, class
presentations, participation and weekly visual journal,
and a final self-reflection.

HS 1097 Buddhist Philosophies
LAKEY, HEATHER
What is the nature of self? What is the nature of
mind? Why do we suffer? What is enlightenment?
This course introduces students to the foundations
of Buddhist philosophy and practice. Buddhism
encompasses a variety of different traditions,
teachings, practices, and goals. In this class, we
will adopt a philosophical perspective to explore a
range of Buddhist thinking on topics such as reality,
consciousness, nothingness, selfhood, and ethical
conduct.
We will begin by reading Asvaghosa’s Buddhacarita,
which tells the story of Siddhartha Gautama, the
historical Buddha. Next, we will study the Theravada,
Buddhism’s foundational structure, and then
proceed to explore the later Mahayana teachings.
This course will study primary literature, including
excerpts from the Pali Canon and several Mahayana
sutras, alongside selections from contemporary
thinkers such as Thich Nhat Hanh, angel Kyodo
williams, and Pema Chodron. Along the way, we will
discuss suffering (duhkha), emptiness (sunyata),

90

impermanence (anitya, non-self (anatman),
interdependence (pratityasamutpada), craving
and attachment (trsna) the four noble truths,
the eightfold path, liberation and enlightenment
(nirvana), action and causation (karma), wisdom
(prajna), compassion (karuna and bodhicitta), and our
responsibilities to other beings.
Over the course of the term, students will consider
the relationship between Buddhist philosophy
and Buddhist practice. To do so, students will be
introduced to different meditation practices through
a series of guest speakers and, depending on COVID
restrictions, a visit to a local Buddhist center. This
course will be conducted in seminar style with an
emphasis on class participation. No prior background
in Buddhism or philosophy is required. Course
requirements include an in-class presentation, weekly
writing assignments, a midterm essay, and a final
project.

HS 1098 Intercultural Communication
CHIEN, MING-TSO
Intercultural communication deals with the
communicative interactions of people and groups
across cultures. In this interdisciplinary course,
you will examine the communication factors within
intercultural encounters and consider topics including,
but not limited to: the significance and history of
intercultural communication studies; language,
identity, and culture; intercultural competencies;
power and ideology in intercultural communication;
intercultural conflicts and relationships; intercultural
communication in educational and other contexts.

awareness of intercultural communicative differences;
(2) provide you with the concepts, knowledge,
and skills to analyze, interpret, and respond to
different intercultural communicative processes
on the interpersonal, group, and/or organizational
levels. To accomplish these goals, the course will
introduce you to texts and other audiovisual materials
featuring narratives and scenarios of intercultural
communication; engage you in immersive and
interactive learning activities that will expose you to
others’ perspectives and experiences of intercultural
communication; equip you with the tools to develop
intercultural competence. Class sessions will
include some lectures but mostly consist of guided
discussions, activities, and presentations. Evaluations
will be based on individual and group projects
that involve intercultural interactions, interviews,
film screenings and discussions, and intercultural
competence workshops.

Management
MALTZ, ERICA
In this course you will gain a practitioner-level
framework for understanding regulatory, policy, and
collaborative mechanisms used to solve complex and
multi-jurisdictional ecological problems in the United
States. We will focus on the roles of tribal, federal
and state governments in the most current inland
fisheries and wildlife management issues. Through
weekly case studies you will analyze and evaluate
natural resources decision making and practice
policy analysis for the purpose of recommending
management decisions. We will address an array of
themes including, but not limited to, the alignment
of jurisdictions to collaboratively solve problems, the
role of tribal sovereignty in creating policy change,
the influence of nonprofits and the public, and political
extremism. The goals of this course are: 1) to provide
students with a practitioner-level framework for
natural resources management in the U.S. and 2) to
provide an opportunity for students to develop and
refine qualitative analytical skills. Students will be
evaluated based on weekly papers, participation, and

HS 1100 College Seminar: Writing the
Environment
CAPEN, JOHN
One day in the late spring of 1630, somewhere in
the North Atlantic, John Winthrop told his Puritan
congregation that, “We must consider that we shall
be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are
upon us.” And so, days before the Arbella anchored
in what would become Boston Harbor and 146 years
before independence had been declared, American
Exceptionalism was born. Or was it? Eleven years
earlier, write the authors of The 1619 Project, “a ship
appeared [off] the British colony of Virginia. It carried
more than 20 enslaved Africans, who were sold to
the colonists. America was not yet America, but this
was the moment it began [and from it] grew nearly
everything that has made America truly exceptional.”
This seminar will examine the complex legacy of
the idea of American Exceptionalism through four
defining primary documents across four centuries:
A Model of Christian Charity (1630), Declaration of
Independence (1776), Gettysburg Address (1863),
and I Have a Dream (1963). We will also draw from
recent academic and popular works by Edward
Baptist, Isabel Wilkerson, Nikole Hannah-Jones,
James McBride, and Clint Smith, among others, that

will provide both historical and critical context to
help situate these texts and make sense of what they
mean for us today. Drawing from additional accounts
from various periods in US history, we will wrestle
with the contrasting narratives of identity and lived
experience to learn what they can tell us about the
past, present, and future of the United States, its
people, and its relationship to the rest of the world.
This is an introductory discussion based reading
seminar. Prior coursework or knowledge of United
States history is not necessary for taking the class.
Students will be evaluated on their contributions to
class discussions, short writing assignments, and a
final project, either individual or collaborative, which
we will develop during the term.

MCKOWN, JAMIE

HS 2010 Literature, Science, and
Spirituality

This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of
public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century
woman suffrage activists in the United States. This
includes works by those individuals most often
associated with the first wave of the movement
including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper,
Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott,
Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who
are generally less well known today. While this is
a course rooted in the history of what we might
consider early American feminism, it should come
as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront
issues that continue to have salience today. Many
of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity,
equality, empowerment, and political allyship that
these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant
for us to consider in our contemporary context. This
is especially true when it comes to the topic of race
and the intersectional nature of the discourse around
gender equality, both then and now.

WALDRON, KAREN
A survey of Anglo-American literature from the
Scientific Revolution to the present. Focuses on
the ongoing debate about the role of science in
Western culture, the potential benefits and dangers
of scientific experimentation, the spiritual, religious,
social and political issues that come about with the
Ages of Discovery and Reason, and their treatment
in literature. Specific debates include concerns over
what is “natural,” whether knowledge is dangerous,
the perils of objectivity, and the mind/body dichotomy;
works include Shelley’s Frankenstein, Ibsen’s An
Enemy of the People, Brecht’s Galileo, Lightman’s
Einstein’s Dreams, and Naylor’s Mama Day as well as
short stories and poems. Writing-focused option.

We will spend time examining how the idea of race
was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and
inclusionary ways, within these texts. We will also
look specifically at the works of early Black feminists
in the United States, and the myriad of ways they
navigated the challenges of the moment, especially
as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of
white supremacy within the early woman suffrage
movement. Rather than rely primarily on secondary
historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis
on the close reading of primary source materials,
mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers in
their own words. In addition, students will also take
part in hands-on recovery projects designed to locate,
transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible
works from the period that have been previously
undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so,
students will learn basic techniques for exploring and
making effective use of various types of digitized
historical collections that have emerged in recent
years.
Class sessions will be organized as a discussedbased seminar. Assignments will emphasize critical,
reflective, and analytical writing. Evaluation will be
based on participation in class discussion, short
written response papers, two longer form takehome essays, individual presentations, and a final
recovery project. Students interested in topics
related to gender, politics, historical research, and
activism are especially encouraged to enroll. This is an
introductory class and open to all students regardless

HS 2011 Nineteenth Century American
Women
WALDRON, KAREN
This course studies the American novel as written
by women of the 19th century. It focuses on how
women’s issues and styles changed over the course
of the century, with its revolutionary economic,
technological, social and political shifts, as well as on
enduring questions. As we read from among the wide
selection of 19th century American women novelists
(who outnumbered and outsold male authors)—such
as Rowson, Foster, Child, Cooke, Fern, Stowe, Phelps,
Jewett, Chopin, and Gilman—we consider how they
have shaped the tradition of the novel and social
values Americans encounter today.

HS 2020 Geographic Information Systems
I: Foundations and Applications
LONGSWORTH, GORDON
Ever-rising numbers of people and their impact on
Earth’s finite resources could lead to disaster, not
only for wildlife and ecosystems but also for human
populations. As researchers gather and publish more
data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

the interrelationships between human actions and
environmental degradation. Much of what threatens
the earth and its inhabitants is place-based. Solutions
require tools to help visualize these places and
prescribe solutions. This is what GIS is about. Built
on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial
analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to
enable people to better work together using the best
information possible. For these reasons, some level
of competency is often expected for entry into many
graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural
resources, planning and policy, and human studies.
The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and
applied. The course begins with training in the basics
of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects
that address real-world issues. Project work composes
the majority of course work and each student has the
opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS
provides tools to help address many kinds of issues,
GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally
and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive
data library for the Acadia region developed by
students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS
Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations
and students can tap into the resources of a broad
network of groups and individuals working towards
a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are
partially based on the on-time completion of exercises
and problem sets. Most of the evaluation is based on
critique of student independent final project work and
related documentation.

computer literacy. Class Limit: 10. Lab Fee: $75

HS 2021 Immersion Practica in Spanish and
Yucatecan Culture
PEÑA, KARLA
This course is intended to provide students with an
immersion experience in the language and culture
of Spanish speakers in the Yucatán Peninsula. The
objectives are to increase their abilities to navigate
the linguistic and cultural terrain of another society in
sensitive, ethical, and effective ways. Class sessions,
visiting lecturers, field trips, and readings will provide
background on the history and anthropology of
Yucatecan culture. Immersion experiences and living
with a family will provide one important source of
experiential learning. A second will be provided
by an independent project or activity developed
for each student based on the student’s interests.
This independent project will include a practicum
experience in some institutional setting that might be
a class room (e. g. an art class at the local university),
a bakery, an internet café, a church group, or some
other place for social service or other work relevant
to a student’s interests. This practicum experience
will involve weekly activities during the term and more
intensive work during the last three weeks. Evaluation
will be based on participation in weekly class

discussions and on weekly reflective papers written in
Spanish.

HS 2038 Gender, Politics, and Nature in
Folk/Fairy Tales of the World
TUROK, KATHARINE
Why do fairy tales capture the attention of adults
and children all over the world and endure in popular
literary and cinematic forms? What do they reveal
to psychologists, biologists, historians, linguists,
artists, anthropologists, and educators? Do they
politicize or de-politicize? socialize or subvert? What
is the postfeminist, postmodern response to the
Brothers Grimm? What do fairy tales convey about
animal behavior, entomology, and cosmology? How
might the tales shape human limitations, moral
values, and aspirations? This course will explore the
storytelling and retelling of literary, cultural, and
scientific stories from a comparative perspective,
imagining their interpretations and how they may
be retold with an eye toward new understandings of
human interrelationships, of a given sociohistorical
moment, the culture of COA, and the larger culture.
Students will read folklore and fairy tales, view
several films, and discuss essays by writers such
as Cristina Bacchilega, Bruno Bettelheim, Ruth
Bottigheimer, Michel Butor, Italo Calvino, Robert
Darnton, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Maria Tatar, and
Jack Zipes. Contemporary works by writers, visual
artists, and musicians inspired by traditional tales
will also be explored. Writers may include Margaret
Atwood, A.S. Byatt, Angela Carter, Robert Coover,
Michael Cunningham, Neil Gaiman, Tanith Lee,
Naguib Mahfouz, Haruki Murakami, Helen Oyeyemi,
Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, Francine Prose, and Anne
Sexton. Reflections may center on recurrent motifs
and patterns, and social, sexual, moral, scientific,
and political content, with emphasis on race, gender,
and class structure. Students will be evaluated on
two short papers, one creative project that may be
expressed in writing, visual art, music, or dance, and
a final written assignment in any genre—poems, plays,
fiction, or nonfiction.

in the world, the largest caribou herd in North
America, the only confirmed Viking settlement in
North America, and Paleozoic water bottled for
consumption? The remote Canadian province of
Newfoundland and Labrador presents a stunning

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

landscape, an astoundingly rich ecological setting,
and a tragic history of poverty amidst an incredible
natural resource, the northern cod fishery, that
was ultimately destroyed. The province has been
alternately invaded or occupied by different groups
of Native Americans along with Norseman, Basques,
French, British, and the US military because of
its strategic location and rich fishing and hunting
grounds. One of the first and one of the last British
colonies, this richest of fisheries produced a very
class-based society, composed of a wealthy few urban
merchants and an highly exploited population of
fishing families often living on the edge of survival.
But within the past 50 years, Newfoundland society
has been forced to evolve. The provincial government
looks towards oil and mineral exploitation to turn
around the economy, while ex-fishermen consider
eco- and cultural tourism with growing ambivalence.
This then is our setting, and background, for an
intense examination of the human ecology of this
province; the relationship between humans and their
environment, sometimes successful, sometimes
otherwise, the struggle between the tenuous grasp of
civilization and this marvelous, terrible place. To do
this we will discuss various readings, examine case
studies and review the natural and human history of
this unique province. Our learning will culminate with
a two-week trip to Newfoundland to examine its issues
firsthand. Evaluation will be based on class and field
trip participation, responses to reading questions, a
field journal, and a final project.

States
WESSLER, STEPHEN L
This course will examine bias directed at religions in
the contemporary United States. In this course we
will examine our own religious identities as well as
the stereotypes we have about religions. We will also
probe the level and impact of bias toward a number
of religions in the US, including Jehovah’s Witnesses,
members of the Church of the Latter Day Saints,
Catholics, members of new religious movements,
Jews, and Muslims. This course will address timely
and controversial issues including the relationship
between religion and laws and policies affecting the
LGBTQ population, immigration, and terrorism. Finally,
conflict resolution efforts both in Kosovo, aimed at
resolving tensions and violence between Albanian
Muslims and Serbian Orthodox Christians, and in
Northern Ireland, addressing animosity and violence
between Catholics and Protestants, will prompt a
discussion of approaches for reducing anti-religious
bias. Students will be evaluated on three papers (a
paper on each student’s religious or non-religious
identity, a research paper on a topic chosen by each
94

student, and an opinion editorial), class discussion,
and short written assignments relating to the readings
for the course.

emphasize the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment
using landmark Supreme Court decisions. Topics
include: speech, press, expressive conduct, religious
liberty, race- and gender-based discrimination,
personal autonomy (such as privacy and right to die),
reproductive rights, marriage equality, and the rights
of the accused. With sufficient enrollment, all students
will participate in a moot court (simulated Supreme
Court) decision, arguing a case currently pending
before the US Supreme Court. Student evaluation will
be based upon written quizzes, short papers, case
briefing (case summary writing), and the moot court
decision (either a lawyer’s brief or justice’s opinion).
This course is appropriate for students interested in
rights advocacy, rights activism, diversity studies,
public policy, and legal studies.

discuss amazing short stories and amazing authors;
we will learn how to offer constructive criticism of
each other’s work; and we will write, we will write,

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

we will write. Class meetings will combine analysis of
published work with a discussion of how individual
writers approach their craft. We will study the conflict,
character, plot, and music of prose. The focus of
this class will be literary fiction. I define literary
fiction as work that is concerned not just with what
happened, but why it happened. It is character driven
and explores the motivations, desires, drives, and
consequences of the complex human experience.
It is the stuff of life. Representative authors: Jorge
Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Amelia Gray, Makoto
Kawabata, Gish Jen, Hemingway, Flannery O’Connor,
Milan Kundera, Mary Gaitskill, James Baldwin, Junot
Diaz. Students are expected to create four shorter
and one longer piece of fiction, respond to published
writers, lead weekly discussions, participate in class
response to fellow writers, and to revise their own
work in substantive ways.

HS 2061 Indigenous America
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
This course will provide an introduction to the history
of indigenous peoples in the Americas. Using a
seminar style the class will combine some overview
lectures, student-led discusion of books and projectbased learning to provide an initial introduction to the
diverse histories of native peoples from Canada to
the Andes. The course will foucus on both pre-contact
societies as well as the processes of interaction
between Europeans and indigenous peoples in the
Americas. Using a selection of case studies the
course will highlight building an understanding of
indigenous worldviews as well as socio-political
organization and the ways both were trasnformed
by colonialism. A range of books will introduce
students to the ethnohistorical literature on native
communities from Mesoamerica, North America, and
the Andes. A simultaneous component of the course
will be student’s research projects on a topic of their
choosing that explores a dimension of native people’s
histories. Students will be evaluated on atendance,
course participation, short analytical essays, and their
final project.

HS 2063 Hate Crimes in the Contemporary
US and Europe
WESSLER, STEPHEN L
Students will learn what causes bias-motivated
violence in schools and communities, how to develop

effective prevention strategies, how to reduce police
violence toward traditionally targeted groups, and
why hate crimes have such destructive impacts on
individuals and communities. The course will focus on
hate crimes and police and community response in the
US and in Europe. The students will examine their own
ethnic, racial, gender, sexual orientation and religious
identities as victims and/or perpetrators of bias and
violence. The course will examine bias and violence
in Europe toward traditionally targeted groups
such as LGBTQ, Muslim, Jewish, migrant, and Roma
people. Finally, the course will examine approaches
to reducing bias motivated violence by police toward
groups such as Blacks, Muslims, and Roma. Students
will be evaluated based on short written responses to
readings, in-class discussion, two papers, and a final
project. The final project will explore some aspect of
bias-motivated violence through persuasive writing,
fiction, poetry, art, photography/film, advocacy, or
interviews. Course readings will include scholarly
writing, reports from human rights NGOs, first-person
accounts, and one novel. Class sessions will involve
discussions led by me and at times by students, small
group discussions between students, and occasional
guest presenters. The class will travel to Portland or
Lewiston to meet with refugees from places in which
bias-motivated violence has been significant.

it will provide a snapshot of the ideas, traditions, and
debates that shape feminist and queer philosophy.
Second, this course will teach students to critically
interrogate the meaning of sex, gender, sexuality,
power, and oppression. Along the way, we will consider
a host of arguments regarding the sources of sexism,
racism, and heteronormativity, the grounds of sexual
dimorphism, and the relationship between subjectivity
and oppression. Although this course will stress the
many ways feminist theory and queer theory overlap,
we will also consider the emergence and development
of queer philosophy as a distinct and unique discipline.
Some of the principal questions for this course
include: Which categories are used to study the human
being and when are these categories potentially
oppressive or violent? When is language a mechanism
for social and political oppression and when does
language facilitate liberation? How do multicultural,
intersectional, transgender, and queer approaches
inform feminist politics? How do queer philosophers
challenge the theoretical orthodoxies of identity,
gender, and sexuality? Students will be evaluated on
weekly writing assignments, a presentation, a midterm
exam, and a final paper. This will be a discussiondriven course and students should be prepared to
engage and discuss philosophical literature.

One of the deepest human instincts is to tell our life
stories, to figure out who we are. This course will
use a workshop approach with a particular focus on
memoir writing rooted in an exploration of family and
place. We will study the writing process and matters
of craft by reading and responding to memoirs by
contemporary writers (e.g., Terry Tempest Williams’
When Women Were Birds: Fifty-Four Variations on
Voice), practical guides to memoir writing (e.g.,
Bill Roorbach’s Writing Life Stories), and essays on
memoir and memory (e.g., Patricia Hampl’s I Could
Tell You Stories: Sojourns in the Land of Memory).
Class time will include discussion of readings, writing
exercises designed to help students with matters
of language and technique in their own writing, and
group critiques of work-in-progress. Student work
will be publicly shared through a reading and exhibit
on campus. Students will be evaluated on the effort
and quality of their writing, their commitment to the
writing process, their participation in peer review and
workshops, a final portfolio of all their writing, and a
public presentation of their finished work.

HS 2074 Philosophy of Death and Dying
LAKEY, HEATHER
This course philosophically explores the concepts
of death, dying, killing, and life. Topics include the
soul, the afterlife, euthanasia, physician-assisted
suicide, evolving medical definitions of life and
death, hospice and end-of-life care, the ethics
of killing, biotechnologies, and cross-cultural
conceptions of death and grief. Although this course
is primarily grounded in the Western philosophical
and bioethical traditions, we will also consider nonWestern perspectives in an effort to both clarify and
complicate our conceptions of death and dying. The
purpose of this course is not to articulate conclusive
answers, but rather to compel students to think
philosophically about the many profound questions
that arise in the face of death. This is a discussionbased course and students should be prepared
to engage and discuss challenging philosophical
literature. Students will be evaluated on the basis of
weekly writing assignments, a midterm, a final, and
class participation.

HS 2081 Postcolonialism and
Psychoanalysis
VAN VLIET, NETTA
The course considers the definition of the human by
bringing together the field of postcolonial studies
with the field of psychoanalysis. Both postcolonial
studies and psychoanalysis engage questions of
sexualized and racialized difference in the context of
20th century Europe and the legacies of colonialism.
Postcolonial studies and psychoanalysis both also
contend with notions of individual and collective wellbeing, with belonging and exclusion.
Psychoanalysis is a colonial discipline which produced
a form of analysis that emerged in the time of
colonialism. As such, psychoanalysis contributed to
colonial notions of civilized and primitive, of man
and woman, of normal and abnormal, of Europe and
its others. At the same time, however, contexts of
anticolonial struggle in turn shaped psychoanalytic
thought. By examining texts central to these two
fields, this course considers how psychoanalytic
thought can help us understand the processes
through which individuated subjects become defined
in terms of collective groups of belonging such as the
nation, and how filiation and family is connected to
affiliation and nation through relations of affect and
concepts of representational politics.
We will begin with an introduction to the inception of
psychoanalysis in Europe, and examine how it travels
and is taken up in Europe’s colonies. Drawing on
postcolonial theory and literature, we will learn about
the historical emergence of the term “postcolonial,”
the political and disciplinary debates to which the
term gave rise, and its relation to ideas of nationalism,
diaspora, and Orientalism. Geographically, we will
examine examples of anticolonial struggle in Algeria,
India, and Palestine/Israel. Readings will focus
on texts by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida, the
Subaltern Studies group, and scholars who directly
engage with these thinkers, including Jacques
Lacan, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Gayatri
Spivak. Students will be evaluated based on class
participation, reading responses, a midterm essay and
final paper.

HS 2083 Introduction to Journalism:
Telling the Story
LEVIN, ROBERT
This course guides students to produce interesting,
accurate, well-written, compelling articles about
people, processes, and events. The course aims to
give students an understanding of the principles of

American journalism, the structure of journalistic
writing, the techniques for identifying, sourcing, and
gathering information, and insight into how news is
disseminated and read, watched, or listened to in the
digital age.
Students will produce several short articles for the
course, learning the basics of story development,
interviewing, research, and covering meetings and
events. Students will be tasked with thinking critically,
understanding and using news judgment, working
collaboratively and on their own, and developing
skills for efficiency and self-critique. They will be
introduced to the history of American journalism, the
ethics and laws specific to the field, and the modern
media landscape. Students will also learn about and
practice photo journalism. A final project in the course
will include significant research, along with the other
skills in interviewing, observation, and documentation
learned over the term.
Students will be evaluated on the following criteria:
the quality of their reporting, the effectiveness of
their revisions, and participation in class discussions
and peer review sessions.

HS 2084 European Political Institutions
STABINSKY, DOREEN
The European Union is a fascinating, ongoing
experiment in international cooperation. Currently,
27 countries have joined together in a supra-national
political and economic union, creating a political
entity unique to a world of sovereign individual
nation-states. This course focuses on understanding
this complex and evolving union through study of its
main political institutions: the European Council of
Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European
Commission. We will look at the workings of and
functional relationships between these institutions
through readings, meetings with politicians,
bureaucrats, and NGOs involved in European-level
politics, and visits to each of the institutions during
two weeks in Brussels. We will also spend some time
in the course looking at the broader political and
cultural context in which the institutions operate,
through examination of several important current
topics in European politics. Topics could include:
refugees and migrants in Europe, the reauthorization
of the Common Agricultural Policy, Brexit, the rise
of right-wing movements across countries in the EU.
Students will be evaluated based on participation in
class discussions, a reflective journal kept during their
time in Brussels, and a presentation and final essay on
a current EU-relevant political issue of their choosing.

readings and exercises, we explore issues such as
nutrition, worker safety, contested agricultural
and land use policies, hunger, and environmental
and community health. The second part of the
course examines case studies of transformative
food movements around the world, from the Zero
Hunger programs in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to La Via
Campesina global campaign for agrarian reform.
We focus particularly on food sovereignty and
agroecology movements. The final third of the course
focuses on transformative work in Maine and at COA.
Students take multiple field trips to participate in local
movements and to learn about their philosophies,
objectives, and activities. By the end of the course,
students will be able to analyze how power shapes
food systems and articulate a theory of change for
addressing a food systems problem of their choice.
Students are evaluated based on participation in
class discussions and field trips, a series of reflection
papers, and a final project including a paper and an
audio-visual presentation.

HS 2086 Politics and the Supreme Court
SEDDIG, ROBERT
The US Supreme Court has been called “the most
powerful court in the world,” and yet the founders
regarded the judiciary as “the least dangerous
branch” of government, exercising “neither force nor
will, but merely judgment” (Alexander Hamilton). This
seminar will examine the three branches of the US
national government, with its primary focus on the
Supreme Court. We will assess the relations among
the branches at the beginning of the 21st century,
asking whether separation of powers and “checks
and balances” exist today. Added focus on executive
authority (including the increased use of executive
orders by the President) and legislative powers
(often under conditions of stalemate). Is the Supreme
Court supreme in its power? What does it do? Does
the Supreme Court “interpret the law?” Does it, in
fact, make public policy, by mediating conflicts over
values and power at the national level? Was Hamilton
“wrong” in his projection of its role in American
national government? The Supreme Court in recent
years has been at the storm center of protracted
disputes on segregation, abortion, affirmative
action, marriage and partnering, free exercise of
religion, and the death Peñalty. Can the court resolve
these national disputes more easily than other
governmental institutions? And, if so, why? Is the
Supreme Court resolution of disputes circumventing
our democratic institutions?

change across local and global food systems. The
course centers on the question: What would it take to
ensure access to healthy, safe, affordable, culturally
appropriate foods for all people? The first part of the
course critically examines capitalist food systems with
particular attention to the ways culture, politics, and
economics shape our interactions with food. Through

This readings seminar will explore the history of race
thinking and structural forms of power in America
from the earliest settlement of the hemisphere by
Europeans to the 20th century. We will emphasize the
specific mechanisms of power used to produce and
reproduce the ideas and institutions that oppressed
African Americans, Native Americans, and “ethnics”
over the course of the country’s history. As a nation
built on slavery, racial discrimination, and white
supremacy, the United States provides a unique
vantage point from which to examine the workings
out of the strange ideologies of difference that took
root in the New World. The class will explore a wide
range of histories from the origins of slavery in the
17th century as a solution to “the problem of the
poor” to the inclusion of Irish, Jewish and others in
the category of “white” in the 20th. A key aspect of
the course will be examining the construction and
workings of whiteness. The seminar will be based
on discussion of key texts in the scholarship of
race and racism in the United States, and students
will lead those discussions. Other core work of the
class will be mastering the complex arguments and
evidence used to reveal the inner workings of white
supremacy through readings, analytic writing, and
an independent project. The course is intended for a
wide range of students willing to dig in to the work of
reading extensively about a contentious topic to form
their own historical analysis of the past. Evaluation will
be based on discussion, mastery of the readings, short
analytic writing, and a final project.

HS 2096 Nature, Humans, and Philosophy
LAKEY, HEATHER
According to COA’s website, human ecology studies
the relationship between humans and their natural,
cultural, built, and technological environments. But
what do we mean by “nature” and what distinguishes
a natural environment from a cultural one? Moreover,
what kind of relationships should we cultivate with
our natural environments? This discussion-based
course offers a philosophical and ethical exploration
into the concept of nature. We will draw on a variety
of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism,
deep ecology, American philosophy, Taoism, and
Poststructuralism in order to critically interrogate
our understanding of nature, as well as our ethical
beliefs regarding human responsibility to the natural
world. We will read selections from thinkers such as
Aristotle, Carolyn Merchant, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, John Muir, Arne
Naess, Val Plumwood, Kate Soper, Mark Sagoff,
Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau,
Lao Tzu, Terry Tempest Williams, and others.
In the first half of the course, we will examine
different philosophical frameworks that theorize
the idea of nature and environmental responsibility.
Guiding questions include the following: What is
“nature?” How is the concept of nature politicized and
socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations
to nature? How should humans relate to nature?
What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction
between humans and nature? During the second half
of the course, we will pivot our attention to specific
ethical topics such as: control over natural resources,
environmental justice, the land ethic, rights for
non-human objects, wilderness, sustainability, and
consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit
questions pertaining to philosophy and environmental
activism, and we will consider how philosophy can
help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities to our
natural environments.
Upon completion of this course, students will have
gained a richer philosophical understanding of the
idea of nature and they will be familiar with key
debates in environmental ethics. Course requirements
include weekly writing assignments, a midterm exam,
a final paper, and class participation. There are no
prerequisites, but students should arrive to this class
prepared to engage difficult philosophical texts and to
share their ideas with others.

HS 2097 Fiction Writing: Crafting
Believable Characters
CASS, BLAKE
By gaining exposure to theatrical techniques, students
will learn how to craft bold works of fiction with rich,
believable characters. Drawing on the work of theatre
practitioners such as Sanford Meisner and Viola
Spolin, this activity-based course will involve daily
individual and collaborative writing exercises that
teach students to orient themselves within fictional
worlds through heightened sensory awareness and
instill a practice of exploring character through
desires and objectives. The goals are to provide a
set of tools that enable students to express the inner
complexity of a wide-range of characters through
action and nuanced, realistic dialogue.
This is a writing-intensive course. Short writing
assignments will challenge students to put into
practice the techniques we have experimented with
in class, and each student will craft two short stories
that will be workshopped and revised. In addition, we
will read between 10-15 short stories, and students will
compose weekly reading responses that allow them to
examine how character development relates to other
fictional strategies such as plot, backstory, point of
view, and tone. Evaluation is based on participation in
class activities, successful completion of all minor and
major writing assignments, and the ability to provide
constructive feedback during workshop experiences.

HS 2098 Introduction to Philosophy of Mind
JACOBY, FRANKLIN R
What is the mind and how does it relate to the body?
This two-part question will guide the structure of
this introductory course in the philosophy of mind.
Other questions that will arise include how can the
mind influence the body? Is this distinction between
mind and body deep? Is there a single discipline that
can tell us what the mind is and, if not, why not? Is
science of help? What strategy or method is best
suited to understanding the mind? Do other cultures
or religions offer insight? Is the mind inherently
mysterious and unknowable?
Attempts to understand the mind have vexed and
stimulated philosophers, scientists, and others since
at least as far back as Descartes. Starting with his
work, we’ll explore classic and contemporary texts in
western thought, with particular focus on philosophy,
but with some psychology, neuroscience and nonWestern thought. We will cover a number of theories
and our own assumptions about this basic and
fundamental feature of human life. Some of the main
accounts students will gain familiarity with include
dualism, materialism, panpsychism, emergence,
and phenomenology. Evaluation will be based on

LEWIS, RHIANNON
This course is designed for students who are
interested in nonprofit organizations and want to
become strategic and effective communicators in
this setting. We will learn to compose clear, concise,
and compelling materials that meet the varied
communication needs typical of nonprofits. Through
analyzing the writing of nonprofits, investigating case
studies and sector trends, and producing a portfolio
of original materials, we will gain an understanding of
the common genres of nonprofit writing and develop
skills needed to support a successful mission-driven
organization. In addition to writing for multiple
audiences and communication channels, students will
practice selecting appropriate imagery and creating
content collaboratively. Students are encouraged to
pursue a service-learning opportunity by working with
a local nonprofit organization. Evaluation is based on
class participation and successfully completing four
short writing assignments (options include a mission
statement, case for support, fundraising letter,
brochure, talking points, press release, and content
marketing piece) and one longer project, such as a
grant proposal, report, or study.

Is having debt good or bad? Is having credit card debt
worse than having student loans, and if so why? Why
are home mortgages usually set up over the course
of 30 years? If a country paid to educate you, do you
“owe” them? Are you indebted to your parents and,
if you are, should you pay them back in money or in
some other way? These are some of the questions
that will be explored in this class. This course will
cover interpretations of the rise of money, the social
power of debt (both monetary and other), and the
disconnect between the ways in which people think
about debt and the way households and companies
actually use it and the function debt plays in the
economy. This course will use both sociological
and anthropological readings to inform your
understanding of the connections between money
and meaning. Successful completion of this course will
depend heavily on completing the weekly readings.
Evaluation will be based on course participation and
three short papers.

environmental issues Indigenous peoples face in
Maine and throughout North America due to climate
change and environmental injustice. Students will
explore theories of structural power and colonization,
as well as case studies examining the legal
recognition of Indigenous peoples, and their lands, by
contemporary governments. These historical forces,
and their effects on current environmental, political,
and legal logics will be critically analyzed while also
exploring various legal and political strategies applied
by Indigenous nations as they adapt to climate change
and participate in the global policy response to our
changing climate. Students will have the opportunity
to deepen their understanding of traditional
ecological knowledge and Indigenous science in
relation to climate effects on natural resource
conditions, as well as climate justice resistance and
resilience movements. Through rethinking colonialism,
the course will deconstruct contemporary issues
of climate change while analyzing some of the
ideological and structural logics that perpetuate
environmental devastation, its disproportionate
impacts on Indigenous peoples globally, and the local
and Indigenous movements who are dynamically
changing the narrative around resistance, justice, and
knowledge. Students will be evaluated based on class
participation, a series of synthesis papers, a student
designed mini-ethnographic project, and a final
research proposal and paper.

HS 2109 Rethinking the Canon: Self,
Others, and Philosophy
LAKEY, HEATHER
How do “philosophies born of struggle” (Leonard
Harris) change, disrupt, and advance the discipline of
philosophy? Academic philosophers have historically
studied a select group of thinkers, most of whom are
white men from Europe. European philosophers offer
wonderfully rich arguments, but like all perspectives,
theirs are partial and limited. To explore foundational
philosophical questions, this course will read canonical
European philosophers alongside scholars who
engage with this canon from a diverse set of cultural,
political, and historical contexts, such as Indigenous
studies, Africana philosophy, Latin American
philosophy, postcolonial studies, and feminist theory.
Along the way, we will read essays that analyze the
concept of “the canon,” and we will consider how
different theoretical interventions advance the

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

discipline of philosophy.
To rethink the canon, this course will center on
four philosophical questions: What is the self or
subjectivity? What is the relationship between
self and other? What makes someone a good or
virtuous person? How do different linguistic forms
(propositional, poetic, narrative) shape our thinking
about reality and relationships? For each set of
questions, we will pair texts from different historical
and cultural contexts. Possible philosophers include
Gloria Anzaldúa, Charles Mills, W.E.B Du Bois, Henry
Odera Oruka, Kwasi Wiredu, Ofelia Schutte, René
Descartes, Kris Sealey, Alain LeRoy Locke, David
Hume, Immanuel Kant, Frantz Fanon, Maria Lugones,
Plato, John Locke, Brian Yazzie Burkhart, Friedrich
Nietzsche, Simone de Beauvoir, Winona LaDuke,

HS 2110 College Seminar: Barbed Wires,
Drawn Lines
TANEJA, PALAK
How many times have you mused about the idea
of borders? What do the lines that divide us mean,
and how are we to make sense of them? Literature
has always been a place where questions like these
have been thought aloud. Whether the borders
are geographical or metaphorical, whether they
keep people out or fence people in, borders are
liminal spaces that raise questions about politics,
oppression, belongingness, and identity, which makes
them an important subject for our interrogation.
Since these literatures are born of political events,
our first concern will be to understand the history
of the events themselves. We will achieve that by
reading excerpts from the works of Gyanendra
Pandey, Stanley Waterman, Joe Cleary, and others in
juxtaposition with literature. In addition, the literary
works by Saadat Hasan Manto, Seamus Deane, Gloria
Anzaldúa, and the like will help put the bigger picture
in perspective bringing in various thematic concerns
like religion, violence, language, and gender together.
This class will thus explore two types of borders:
one that course texts evoke, helping you critically
engage with the theme; and the other kind, which
exists between various genres you will encounter like
short stories, novels, literary theory, official reports,
and movies. The latter, coupled with your writing
assignments that we will workshop throughout the
term—personal narrative, online article, movie review,
multimodal project, and others—will facilitate and
deepen your understanding not only of literature from

HS 2113 Latin American Literature: Pablo
Neruda—Residencia En La Tie

LEWIS, RHIANNON
This course traces the development of queer literature
from the 16th century to the present. We will read
selected texts written in English, including poetry,
drama, and novels, that involve sexual and gender
identities other than straight and cisgender. Selections
from queer theorists, such as Michel Foucault, Judith
Butler, Eve Sedgwick, and Gloria Anzaldúa, will frame
our analysis of works by writers such as Christopher
Marlowe, Aphra Behn, Walt Whitman, Leslie Feinberg,
Audre Lorde, and Ocean Vuong. We’ll explore what
constitutes a genre of literature (specifically, queer
literature) by identifying themes, tropes, and other
defining characteristics. Questions we’ll address
include: what makes a work of literature “queer?”
Does the writing of a queer-identifying author
automatically become part of this tradition? Can a
piece of literature be “queer” independent of the
author’s identity? How does queerness intersect with
other identities, including race and socioeconomic
status? What is the social and political importance
of queer literature? Evaluation will be based on class
participation and weekly response papers, one long
paper, and one short, final paper.
Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: None.
Class limit: 12. Lab fee: None

Residencia en la Tierra can be translated in many
different ways: A residency on Earth, residence
on Earth, living on Earth. However, each distinct
translation points us toward a single question: What
does it mean to be at home on Earth? This is an
introduction, in English translation, to the person
considered by many to be the greatest Latin American
poet of the 20th century, Pablo Neruda. Neruda’s
poetry is marked by a series of aesthetic and political
metamorphoses as he continually seeks to address
the aforementioned question in his early love poems,
political poems, sweeping historical works, odes, and
nature poems. Like each of us, Neruda was a witness
to history, and special attention will be devoted to that
history, particularly in terms of the Spanish Civil War,
The Cold War, and the Chilean coup. We will look at a
broad selection of Neruda’s poetry, historical texts,
as well as texts on literary translation. Students will
be expected to complete weekly responses to class
readings, group projects, a midterm drafted essay,
and a final of the student’s own design.

TANEJA, PALAK

This survey of African American literature from its
origins in the slave narrative to the present vivid
prose of some of America’s best writers considers
the impact of slavery and race consciousness on
literary form and power. Readings include letters,
essays, poems, short stories, and novels of some
of the following authors: Phillis Wheatley, Frederick
Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Pauline Hopkins, Langston
Hughes, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston,
Gwendolyn Brooks, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison.

“Only by unleashing the fictionality of fiction, the
imaginativeness of the imagination, the dream
songs of our dreams, can we hope to approach the
new, and to create fiction that may, once again, be
more interesting than the facts”—Salman Rushdie,
Ask Yourself. Nobody exemplifies these notions
better than Rushdie himself. Therefore, this course
will be an exploration of the fantastical world of
Salman Rushdie through his seminal novel Midnight’s
Children. Deemed as one of the Great Books of the
20th century, which won the Booker prize the year of
its publication, 1981, and the Booker of Bookers twice
over (in 1993 and 2008), the novel is a prime example
of postcolonialism with a magical realist twist.

Level: Intermediate. Prerequisite: A previous literature
course or signature of the instructor. Class limit: 15.
Offered every other year. Meets the following degree
requirements: HS

In this class, we will take a deep dive into Rushdie’s
novel by paying close attention to the prose and his
style and the history and contexts that he sets up in
this novel. Therefore, the reading of the novel will
be supplemented with historical background and
literary criticism that bring up questions of utopia,

HS 3023 International Wildlife Policy and
Protected Areas
CLINE, KEN
“Save the whales.” “Save the tiger.” “Save the
rainforest.” Increasingly, wildlife and their habitats are
the subject of international debate with many seeing
wildlife as part of the common heritage of humankind.
Wildlife does not recognize the political boundaries of
national states and as a result purely national efforts
to protect wildlife often fail when wildlife migrates
beyond the jurisdiction of protection. This course
focuses on two principle aspects of international
wildlife conservation: the framework of treaties and
other international mechanisms set up to protect
species; and the system of protected areas established
around the world to protect habitat. We begin with an
examination of several seminal wildlife treaties such
as the International Convention for the Regulation
of Whaling, CITES, migratory bird treaties, and
protocols to the Antarctica Treaty. Using case studies
on some of the more notable wildlife campaigns,
such as those involving whales and elephants, we
seek to understand the tensions between national
sovereignty and international conservation efforts.
The Convention on Biological Diversity and its broad
prescriptions for wildlife protection provide a central
focus for our examination of future efforts. Following
on one of the key provisions in the Convention on
Biological Diversity, the second half of the course
focuses on international and national efforts to create
parks and other protected areas. In particular we
evaluate efforts to create protected areas that serve
the interests of wildlife and resident peoples. Students
gain familiarity with UNESCO’s Biosphere Reserve
model and the IUCN’s protected area classifications.
We also examine in some depth the role that NGO’s
play in international conservation efforts. The
relationship between conservation and sustainable
development is a fundamental question throughout
the course.
Level: Intermediate. Recommended courses: Use
and Abuse of Public Lands, Global Politics and

HS 3027 Microeconomics for Business and
Policy
TAYLOR, DAVIS
What is the best way to insure that communities
can provide dependable, well-paying jobs to their
citizens? Why does Coca Cola spend millions of dollars
to advertise a product with which most people are
already very familiar? What can the game of blackjack
tell us about how industries are structured? How
can we get coal-burning power utilities to reduce
their carbon emissions while they save millions of
dollars in the process? How can we provide much
better health care to all Americans, at much less

cost, while making it easier for small businesses to
grow? All of these questions, and many more like
them, are answered by microeconomic theory. This
intermediate-level course exposes students to basic
microeconomic theories, models, and concepts
that shed insight on the economic behavior of
businesses, individuals, governments and politicians,
and international organizations. We will emphasize
approaches that have numerous overlapping
applications to both business and policy evaluation:
markets, pricing, firm structure and decision-making,
strategic behavior (using game theory), consumer
behavior, externalities (such as greenhouse gas
emissions), and the provision of public goods (such as
military, education, and environmental conservation).
We will pay special attention to the economics of
asymmetrical information (adverse selection, moral
hazard, and principal-agent situations) that have
a wide range of applications, including issues such
as the ineffectiveness of the American health care
system, the structuring of business finance, and the
hiring and paying of employees. This will be a noncalculus course, but will give students exposure to
technical economic modeling, with heavy emphasis on
graphical modeling of complex social phenomena. We
will use a lab period to conduct extensive experiments
and games that illustrate or test economic concepts
and hypotheses.

HS 3029 Shakespeare: Character, Conflict,
and Cinematography
TANEJA, PALAK
This course will focus on Shakespeare’s tragedies as
a direct link between the birth of tragedy in ancient
Greece and the violence of contemporary cinema. The
class begins with a week of Shakespeare’s sonnets as
an entry into the coevolution of language, metaphor
and human emotion. We’ll then compare Hamlet
and Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex in the light of Freudian
theory to shed light on universal issues of incest and
domestic violence, and continue with a play every
week in two extended evening sessions, 4-9 p.m. on
Mondays and Thursdays, with pizza intermission.
The Monday sessions will be a complete dramatic
reading of the play involving the whole class, stopping
to discuss salient points, with the aim of complete
understanding of language, structure and meaning.
The Thursday sessions will be a single or double
feature of contemporary and classic film adaptations,
followed by discussion of the relation between play
and film. Sample pairings would be “Romeo and
Juliet” with Bernstein’s West Side Story; Macbeth with
Geoffrey Wright’s Macbeth and Kurosawa’s Throne
of Blood; King Lear with Moorhouse’s A Thousand
Acres. Two written assignments will involve a choice of

CLINE, KEN
By definition, public lands belong to all of us, yet
public lands in this country have a history of use
(and abuse) by special interests and a shocking
absence of any coherent management strategy for
long-term sustainability. This course is taught in
seminar format in which students read and discuss
several environmental policy and history texts that
concern the history and future of our federal lands.
We also use primary historic documents and texts
to understand the origins of public ownership and
management. We examine the legal, philosophical,
ecological, and political problems that have faced our
national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and
other public lands. An effort is made to sort out the
tangle of laws and conflicting policies that govern
these public resources. Special attention is given to
the historic roots of current policy debates. Evaluation
is based upon response papers, a class presentation,
participation in class discussions, and a group project
looking closely at the historical context and policy
implications of a management issue facing a nearby
public land unit.

primary goal is to give students an intensive, ten-week
crash course into key events, concepts, figures, etc.

politics into everyday life, individuals with widely
varying academic interests will find the course
informative and productive. Evaluation will be based

HS 3032 The Cold War: Early Years

Business has tremendous societal ramifications.
Inventions and industries from the automobile to
the internet impact everything from air quality to
economic and political freedom. Entrepreneurs,
who are often at the forefront of business, and thus
societal innovation, are changing the way business is
conducted by creating businesses that are beneficial
to the bottom line, society and the environment.
Through cases, projects, and present-day examples,
the course will challenge students to understand the
impact of business on society and the challenges and
pitfalls of creating a socially responsible venture. In
addition, it will offer new frameworks for creating
entrepreneurial ventures that capitalize on social
responsibility to gain competitive advantage and
increase valuation while benefiting society and the
environment. The final deliverable for the course is
an in-class presentation in which student teams will
either: (1) recommend ways to improve the social
and environmental impacts of a company, while
increasing competitive advantage and bottom line; or
(2) benchmark two industry competitors, a socially
responsible company versus a traditional company.

LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
This course will explore the rapidly expanding field
of marine environmental history and historical
studies that focus on fish and fisheries. Recent
methodological and conceptual work as well as
growing interest in the history of these topics driven
by conservation and policy issues has made this an
important and innovative field. Using the work of a
variety of scholars from different fields the class will
explore how historical accounts can be constructed
with an emphasis on the types of available sources,
the use of evidence, and how each author builds their
COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

argument. We will explicitly compare the methods, use
of evidence and other aspects of different disciplinary
approaches to the topic to highlight the strengths
and limitations of each approach. This dimension of
the class is particularly interesting because of the
dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of scholarship
right now that brings a wide range of research into
dialogue. Students will learn about the history of
oceans and fishes by looking at how historians and
other scholars frame their works and make their
arguments. Students will be evaluated on their
preparation for discussion, mastery of the material,
short written assignments, and a final project made up
of a presentation and essay. This course is appropriate
for students with interest in history, community-based
research, marine studies, and environmental policy.
Students who are just curious and interested in lots of

HS 3040 History of Agriculture: Apples
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
This course will explore the history of agriculture
from the vantage point of Downeast Maine with a
focus on apples. The premise of the course is that by
exploring this fascinating crop in detail from the local
vantage point of Downeast Maine students will be able
to grasp the many historical processes at work from
the introduction of the fruit in the late 16th and early
17th centuries to the age of agricultural improvement
in the 18th on to the rise and fall of commercial
orcharding as a major component of Maine’s farm
economy in the early 20th century. Using sources
ranging from secondary sources, historical atlases,
aerial surveys, and diaries, we will explore how the
culture of apple agriculture in Maine develops over
time as part of an interconnected Atlantic world where
crops flow back and forth between Britain and the
colonies/US over hundreds of years. Course activities
will include fruit exploration and fieldtrips to track
down and identify antique varieties, as well as visits
to the local farms where a new generation of apple
culture is taking shape. The course will also engage
students with the process of cider making, both sweet
and hard, as well as exercises in the preparation,
storage, and processing of apples. Students will be
evaluated on their participation in discussion, how
they collaborate with others in class projects, and a
final individual or collaborative project. This course is
designed for students interested in history, farming
and food systems, community-based research, and
policy/planning issues. It is also very appropriate for
students who like apples and just want to know (a lot)
more.

HS 3050 Poetry Workshop

HS 3059 Native American Literature

MAHONEY, DANIEL

WALDRON, KAREN

This class is designed to teach the skills and
techniques of writing poems. We will begin by
discussing what makes a poem a poem—specifically,
intensity of language, image, and metaphor. Students
will craft their own poems and submit them for peer
and instructor review, which will focus on these three
aspects and expand from there. In discussion, we will
look at what is giving a poem life, and what is taking
life away from a poem, such as breakdowns in logic or
syntax, the use of derivative material, or the failure to
develop. At all times discussion will be grounded and
informed by successful poems in the tradition, both
contemporary and from the canon. Assigned readings
from the two texts above will inform discussion of
important poetic devices, such as use of image,
metaphor, voice, sentence, and meter.

This course is a challenging introduction to several
centuries of Native American literature, the relevance
of historical and cultural facts to its literary forms,
and the challenges of bridging oral and written
traditions. Authors include such writers as Silko,
Erdrich, Harjo, Vizenor, and McNickle as well as earlier
speeches and short stories. We also consider nonNative readings and appropriation of Native American
styles, material, and world views.

This course focuses on islands—geopolitically
and conceptually—to consider the significance of
postcolonial difference for contemporary political
questions about representation, violence, exile and
diaspora, climate change, poverty, racialization, and
sexuality. Islands have long been imagined as sites
of fantastic possibility and power, as places of refuge
and respite as well as places of horror and dread.
They are places imagined as home to cannibals and
monsters, but also as idyllic vacations spots and safe
havens for shipwrecked sailors. Etymologically, the
word island carries with it the meaning of both land
and water, and islands are defined as fragments of a
whole, and simultaneously as whole unto themselves,
raising questions about binaries and boundaries
between self and other and about the conceptual
topographies of territory, land and water, thresholds
between here and there. Islands have been sites ripe
for colonial ventures, understood as isolated, insular,
and susceptible to translation and appropriation but
also as resistant, bounded, singular, and fertile sites of
diversity. Islands have also been significant in religious
understandings of them as sites for communion with
God or as final places of burial. This course will examine
islands in these terms as they have been articulated
in the literary imagination, in postcolonial studies
and ethnography, and in political theory. Drawing
on examples such as Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, J.M.
Coetzee’s Foe, The Odyssey, Plato’s Atlantis, Jonathan
Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Shakespeare’s The Tempest,
Octave Mannoni’s Prospero and Caliban, Aime Cesaire’s
A Tempest, as well as on ethnography in island studies
(including classic ethnography such as Malinowski’s
Trobriand Islands, and recent scholarship such as The
Island Studies Journal and A World of Islands), we will
consider questions about political representation,
language and translation, religious, ethnic and sexual
difference, the definition of the human, mobility and
sovereignty, resistance, and domination. Students
will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class
participation, reading responses, one short analytical
essay, and a final exploratory research project that

HS 3062 Solutions
FRIEDLANDER, JAY
We live in a world of problems—global warming,
inequality, discrimination, child labor, slavery, waste,
species extinction, domestic violence, and a myriad
of other issues occupying the headlines can feel
overwhelming at times. Unfortunately, we rarely here
about solutions, let alone have the opportunity to
create our own solutions for the issues that concern
us and inspire us to action.
Changing the world takes more than a critical eye
for what is wrong, proselytizing a good idea and
hope. There are many factors which contribute to
creating social change and in this course we explore
what it takes to be a successful change maker in our
communities, and thus in the world. Reversing the lens
we use to approach the problems of the world is part
of what a human ecologist needs to do to understand
our challenges:
“Social entrepreneurs are uniquely suited to make
headway on problems that have resisted considerable
money and intelligence. Where governments and
traditional organizations look at problems from the
outside, social entrepreneurs come to understand
them intimately, from within” —David Bornstein, How
To Change The World
In this experiential, project-based course students
will select a specific problem they would like to
solve. Students will perform thorough research
into a problem of their choosing, understanding it
from within by identifying root causes and other
exacerbating factors as well as investigating positive
deviance and what people around the world are doing
to solve this issue. Through these projects and other
readings, students will examine a myriad of problems
around the world and look at different strategies
people are using to tackle them and create positive
social change. The final project for the course will
be a concrete proposal for solving the problem they
selected. Students will be evaluated based on their
performance, participation, and the quality of the
projects they produce over the course of the term.

HS 3068 Linguistics, Language, and
Culture: Human Ecological Approach
COX, GRAY
This course explores the basic questions concerning
the origins, nature, history, functions, and

philosophical significances of human languages.
Comparisons to other species and to machine
languages will also be examined. Readings will
include classics texts by Chomsky and others as
well selected materials from diverse disciplines such
as linguistic anthropology, psychology, ethology,
aesthetics, history of languages, and philosophy.
Class sessions will include a mix of discussion, lecture,
and visiting speakers. Each student will undertake a
term-long project examining some topic of interest
and examine it from the point of view of the different
disciplines and theories covered in the course. Project
topics might include the development of identity,
the articulation of gender, forms of representation,
the expression of emotion, concepts of rationality,
relations between meaning and truth, and
communication in an age of artificial intelligences. The
goals of the course are: 1) to familiarize students with
the range of phenomena associated with language
and the principal questions they raise and the theories
used to interpret them, and 2) to develop skills in
researching interdisciplinary questions. Assignments
will include two problem sets, a series of weekly
homework exercises, and the term project which must
be presented both orally and in a major paper due at
the end of the term. Evaluation will be based on the
extent to which in-class participation and work on
the assignments demonstrates substantive progress
on the two goals of the course. There are no specific
prerequisites, but students will be expected to be able
to contribute insights, information, and questions
from previous work in relevant disciplines and/or
studies of languages, undertake challenging readings,
and pursue a major independent project.

HS 3069 Genocide, Resistance, Response,
and Reconciliation
WESSLER, STEPHEN L
Students will explore: the differences and similarities
between genocides and ethnic cleansings; why people
join resistance groups; why other countries intervene
or fail to intervene to stop genocide; and whether post
genocide reconciliation is effective. The course will
focus on several genocides or ethnic cleansings from
different parts of the globe, for example toward Native
Americans in the US, Chinese in Nanking, Jews, Roma,
and others during the Holocaust, Muslims in Bosnia &
Herzegovina, and Tutsi people (and a smaller number
of Hutus) in Rwanda. Students will be evaluated
based on short written responses to readings, in class
discussion, two papers, and a final project. The final
project will explore the topics in the course through
fiction, poetry, art, film, advocacy, interviews, or other
forms of expression. The course readings will be a
mix of scholarly writing about genocide, first person
accounts, and perhaps some fiction and poetry. We

highly disturbing material on genocide by focusing on
the remarkable courage of individuals both during and
after genocide has run its course.

HS 3070 Native American Law
CLINE, KEN
From first contact through the confrontation
surrounding the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the
Dakota Access Pipeline, Native American law has
tried to reconcile two incommensurate legal systems
and widely varying government policies. This course
examines the evolution of federal Native American or
“Indian” Law from colonization onward as impacted by
treaties, executive orders, congressional enactments,
and major US Supreme Court cases interpreting the
US Constitution and statutes as they involve Native
American legal issues. This is not a class about tribal
law or the indigenous legal systems that exist among
the various tribes in the US; rather, it examines the
legal system imposed on tribes from the outside—a
system that has evolved over time and creates the
legal framework which tribes operate under today.
Students will gain an understanding of law as a policy
tool and framework, and acquire the necessary skills
to work on policy issues affecting Native peoples.
We will focus on primary legal material as well as
secondary interpretations of that material. There
will be some comparative law analysis from other
countries and an examination of how the United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples relates to US practices. Students will
complete several analytical problem sets that require
an application of course concepts to fact scenarios
as well as a major paper on a legal topic of their
choosing. A class visit to a Maine reservation will allow
conversation with tribal leaders involved with current
environmental and Native American issues in Maine.

HS 3073 Bees and Society
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
In the last decade the plight of wild and domesticated
bees has pervaded the media and public discourse,
yet bees remain largely misunderstood in our
society. This course examines the interconnected

108

relationship between humans and bees and asks
what bees can teach us about ourselves and our
food systems. Through readings, fieldtrips, and
guest lectures, students will examine the social,
economic, and political dimensions of human-bee
interactions, investigating topics such as: historical
and contemporary beekeeping practices; the
political economy of honey; the role of pollination
in agriculture and agroecosystems; domestication
and human-animal relationships; biodiversity loss
in agricultural systems; pollinator conservation
and policy; and cooperation and decision making in
human and bee societies. A truly human-ecological
course, Bees & Society integrates the humanities,
natural sciences, and social sciences to examine
the applied problem of protecting pollinators in a
time of abrupt environmental change. Students
will be evaluated based on: (1) participation in class
discussions, fieldwork, and field trips; (2) a series of
short reflection papers; and (3) a final class project.
For their final project, students will develop two native
bee conservation workshops—one for elementary
school students and one for farmers and gardeners—
and host the workshops at COA’s farms.

HS 3074 Mapping the Ocean’s Stories
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
This course will examine how members of Maine’s
remote coastal and islands communities live in
relationship to the ocean. Their connection to the
nearby and distant waters is defined by everyday uses
such as fishing, lobstering, and wrinkle harvesting as
well as deeper historical relationships rooted in many
generations of people doing everything from sailing
schooners around the world to harvesting shellfish
in the same cove over centuries. This class will teach
students how to use multidisciplinary research
methodologies to document, map, and analyze both
contemporary and historical uses of the ocean.
Using coastal and island communities as sites for
collaborative, community-based research the class will
contribute to wider discussions about a process known
as ocean planning that seeks to create processes to
plan how communities, stakeholders, industry, and
the government build a long term vision of how the
spaces of the Gulf of Maine might be used. Students
will work in teams to produce a geo-referenced story
about a particular place in the ocean off the coast of
Maine that has meaning and an emotional connection
to a community told in an interesting and compelling
way. This information will help give island communities
a stronger voice in ocean policy and in decision
making processes for siting large scale projects in
the nearby ocean environment. The class will draw
on methodologies developed around North America
to document the everyday uses and interactions

historical and biographical mapping to provide a
sort of snapshot of current uses as well as soliciting
histories of how those patterns have changed over
time. The class will include a substantial fieldwork
and field trip component that will require additional
times outside of the class schedule. Students will be
evaluated on class participation, active engagement
in field research settings, short assignments, and a
final project. The class is appropriate for students
with a range of backgrounds, however, experience
with historical or community-based research or GIS
mapping would be helpful.

HS 3076 US Farm and Food Policy
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
This course offers a broad introduction to food and
farm policy in the United States. Food and farm policy
encompasses laws, regulations, norms, decisions,
and actions by governments and other institutions
that influence food production, distribution, access,
consumption, and recovery. This course focuses on
the policy process and two major policy tools: the US
Farm Bill and US Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
The course begins with an overview of the evolution
of food and farming technology in the United States.
Students are then introduced to the concepts,
institutions, and stakeholders that influence farm and
food policy, and examine examples of some of the
most salient contemporary issues. Topics covered
include: food production and the environment;
farm-based biodiversity conservation; international
food and agricultural trade; food processing,
manufacturing, and retail industries; food safety;
dietary and nutrition guidelines; food labeling and
advertising; food and biotechnology; food waste
and recovery; food advocacy and activism; and food
insecurity and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP). Through case studies and exercises
students examine the policymaking process at the
local, state, and federal level and learn to evaluate
various policy options. Finally, the course compares
and contrasts international perspectives on farm and
food policies and programs. Students are evaluated
based on participation in class discussions, a series of
op-ed essays, in-class briefs and debates, and a policy
recommendation report on the upcoming US Farm Bill.

HS 3079 College Seminar: The
Anthropology of Food
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
This course uses food as a lens to explore human
origins, cultural diversity, social structure, and
human/environment interactions. Through academic
articles and films, the course exposes students to
the different ways anthropologists think about food
and the frameworks they use to answer questions
concerning the human experience. The course also
engages other disciplinary perspectives—including
history, economics, and political ecology—to make
larger connections between food and society.
Designed as a survey course, this course introduces
students not only to writing as process—prewriting,
writing, and rewriting—but also to the broad and
dynamic subfield of food anthropology. The course
is organized around four themes. The first—human
origins, diets, and biocultural evolution—explores the
uniqueness of cooking to the human species, and
how the coevolution of human diets and culture has
shaped different groups’ dietary needs, practices,
and restrictions. The second—globalization and
international trade—looks at the flow of foods and
food practices around the world, from sugar to sushi.
The third—hegemony and difference—considers how
race, gender, and class are constructed and expressed
through food. The final theme—consumption and
embodiment—considers the relationship between
eating and the body; readings in this section focus
on body image, eating practices, and critical studies
of the rhetoric around hunger and obesity. Students
are evaluated based on class participation, a series
of reflection papers, a dietary analysis, a recipe
project involving a prepared meal, an audio-visual
presentation, and a critical analysis paper. This course
meets the first-year writing requirement.

HS 3083 Feminist Theory in a
Transnational Frame II
VAN VLIET, NETTA
This course covers some of the central texts and
genealogies of feminist thought, with a focus on
transnational feminist theory. We will address periods
of feminist thought that have been significant in
shaping the concerns of transnational feminisms,
including 1970s US feminism, French feminism,
postcolonial theory, and Marxist thought. Through
seminar discussion about a variety of texts and
films, we will consider how differences across
national borders have informed discussions about
transnational feminist solidarity. We will examine how
feminist theory can help us think about the following:
kinship; reproduction; the law and justice; human

rights discourse, political economy, racialization
and other forms of difference; existence and the
subject; the relation between individual and group;
the relation between terms such as “gender” and
“sex;” and the varied currencies the terms “queer”
and “feminist” have carried in different national
and transnational contexts. This course builds on
Feminist Theory in a Transnational Frame, and while
prior coursework in feminist and sexuality studies
is beneficial, it is not necessary. Ideally, students in
the course will have varied degrees of familiarity
with the central questions of the course. This should
allow for substantive discussion and opportunities to
both formulate and respond to questions posed by
class material. This class builds on work done in other
courses that address questions of feminist thought,
but also is intended to include students with a range
of backgrounds. Students will be evaluated based
on class participation, weekly reading responses, a
midterm and a final essay.

Sustenance is defined as the maintenance or support
of someone or something. It can also be defined as
food and drink as a source of strength or nourishment.
This course embraces both definitions as it delves
into case studies of food enterprises across Maine’s
agrifood value chain. Two central questions frame
the course: 1) What does it take to sustain Maine’s
food system? 2) How do food systems entrepreneurs
pursuing their passion sustain themselves? Through
academic articles, guest lectures, case studies,
and field experiences, students will learn about the
physical, political, economic, and social infrastructure
that supports Maine’s food system. In addition,
they’ll learn about the benefits and challenges faced
by those dedicating their lives to food systems
ventures. Highlighting the essential links that exist
between farm and table, professional and personal,
and idea and implementation, students will examine
enterprises ranging from slaughterhouses and
breweries to seaweed drying facilities and wholesale
food distributors. Students will be evaluated based on
class participation, a series of reflection papers, and a
final project.

Eating is both a biological need and an intensely social
activity. This course examines the evolution, diversity,
social significance, and health consequences of the
human diet across time and space. Designed as a
college seminar, this course introduces students to
writing as process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting—
and the broad and dynamic subfield of nutritional
anthropology. Through academic articles, films,
and guest lectures, the course weaves together the
biological and cultural threads of anthropology to
consider human nutrition in all its complexity. The
course is designed to complement The Anthropology
of Food by focusing in on biocultural approaches
to the study of human diets. The course covers
foundations and theories of nutritional anthropology,
the evolution and adaptation of human diets, dietary
transitions and globalization, and under- and overnutrition. Students are evaluated based on class
participation, a series of synthesis papers, a critical
analysis paper, and a research project including a
paper and an audio-visual presentation.

HS 3087 Seminar in Human Ecology
BORDEN, RICHARD
This seminar traces the historical development of
human ecology. We begin by reviewing the seminal
works in human ecology, the contributions from
biology, and the development of human ecology as
a multidisciplinary concept. Along these lines we
compare the various brands of human ecology that
have developed through sociology (the Chicago
school), anthropology and cultural ecology, ecological
psychology, and economics, as well as humanecological themes in the humanities, architecture,
design, and planning. This background is then used to
compare the COA brand of human ecology with other
programs in this country and elsewhere around the
world. Our final purpose is to look at new ideas coming
from philosophy, the humanities, biological ecology,
and other areas for future possibilities for human
ecology. Evaluations are based on presentations and
papers. Offered every other year.

Responsibility, and Reparations

short midterm essay (three pages) and one short final
paper (five pages).

VAN VLIET, NETTA

Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Open to all
college levels, but students should have some prior
coursework or background in engaging with some
of the conceptual questions that inform this course,
and be prepared for a heavy reading load. Permission
required. Class limit: 15. Lab fee: None. Meets the
following degree requirements: HS

This class examines concepts of rights, responsibility,
and reparations in terms of questions about injustice.
Over the course of the trimester, we will consider
some of the ways these terms have been used in 20th
and 21st century attempts to address the aftermath
of intertwined histories of colonialism, slavery
and capitalism. We will focus on examples that are
different in terms of scale (e.g. institutions such as
nation-states and schools, corporations, as well as
individuals and groups, and the relations between
them), and which differ in terms of political, cultural,
national, and historical context. The examples will
be situated in relation to each other, not through
comparison in terms of similarities and differences,
but through historical and conceptual relation. We will
examine examples from contexts that may include:
South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission;
Guatemala’s Commission for Historical Clarification;
German Holocaust reparations and Israeli state
formation; debates about and proposals for slavery
reparations in the United States; College of the
Atlantic’s efforts to reckon with its own histories; the
controversy over the University of North Carolina’s
“Silent Sam” confederate statue; and related
discussions about how to “repair” and respond to
the aftermaths of past wrongs, including debates
over statues, the names of streets and buildings,
the content and framing of school curriculums,
and the relation between law and justice. This is
an interdisciplinary course that draws from work
in the arts and humanities, including in the fields
and disciplines of postcolonial studies, literature,
philosophy, history, feminist studies, and cultural
anthropology.
Material will likely include texts by Hannah Arendt,
Srinivas Aravamudan, Maoz Azaryahu, W.E.B. Du
Bois, Roy L. Brooks, Tina Chanter, Ta-Nehisi Coates,
J.M. Coeztee, Jacques Derrida, Euripides, Shoshana
Felman, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Ranjana Khanna,
Karl Marx, Chandra Mohanty, Jacques Rancière,
Edward Said, Joan Scott, Hortense Spillers, and
Gayatri Spivak. Readings may include selections from
truth commission reports and related documents,
media articles, as well as fiction works including the
play The Trojan Women, the novel Disgrace, and the
films Bridge Over the Wadi and Arna’s Children. As we
move through this material, we will consider questions
about inheritance, capital, violence, choice, response,
how an “individual” is understood in relation to group
categories and contexts, and relations between
politics and aesthetics. In doing so, we will address
questions about and understandings of freedom,
reconciliation, economic justice, difference, and
responsibility.
Students will be evaluated based on class participation
in seminar discussions, weekly reading responses, one

HS 3099 A History of God: Mysticism,
Metaphysics, Politics, and Nature
COX, GRAY
Religious experiences and concepts have been
central in history. They have informed ideas of self,
community and nature as well as practices of science,
technology and politics. This course provides an
intellectual history of the concepts of god or gods
and related notions and practices. It will focus on
them as they have developed in the West but will
also look, briefly, for comparative purposes at India
and China. It will use secondary materials like Karen
Armstrong’s A History of God and Peter Adamson’s
A History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps to follow
threads of the story from early polytheism up through
the present day. It will also focus on a series of short
selected primary sources including sacred texts as
well as writings by philosophers, theologians, political
thinkers, and mystics. Class format will be a mixture
of lecture and discussion. Students will be evaluated
on their participation in discussions and their ability
to convey their understanding of material in short
homework assignments, two problem sets, and two
papers analyzing the historical connections between
one or more texts and their contexts.

HS 3100 Within Living Memory: Audio
Production and Podcasting
KOCH, GALEN
This course will explore the process of narrative
storytelling with sound. We will study a broad range of
audio formats, from podcasts to audio installations to
interactive soundwalks. Students will learn each step
of creating an audio story, from recording techniques
and initial collection in the field or in archival
collections through the writing to the final production
of a podcast or audio piece. Students will learn the
technical skills of digitizing audio and conducting
interviews, scripting and writing stories based on that
audio, editing audio, and creating sound-rich audio
productions in digital editing software.
This class will focus primarily on digital material
already collected in the field or found in local
collections. These stories are from Downeast

communities in Hancock and Washington counties
and will build on ongoing collaborative work. Students
will work in small groups and individually on each
stage of production based on their interests as
well as on ongoing projects. Opportunities exist to
explore various forms of audio storytelling in a final
project. This course is for students with interests
in documentary work, storytelling, oral history,
and community-based research broadly construed.
Students will be evaluated on individual audio
assignments (transcription, scripting, digitizing, and
production work) as well as their contribution to group
projects.
Level: Intermediate: Prerequisites: Permission of
instructor; preference will be given to students who
have academic background in community-based work
or documentary work or who are in their 3rd or 4th
year. Class limit: 12. Lab fee: None

HS 3102 The Human Ecology of Wilderness
CLINE, KEN
Wilderness has been the clarion call for generations of
environmentalists. Henry David Thoreau once said, “In
wildness is the preservation of the world.” That single
sentence and the controversy surrounding that idea
provides the central focus of our explorations over the
term. This course examines the question of wilderness
from multiple perspectives in the hopes of providing
an understanding of the concept and real spaces that
constitute wilderness. Starting with a week-long canoe
trip down Maine’s Allagash Wilderness Waterway, we
look at historical and contemporary accounts of the
value of wilderness, biological, and cultural arguments
for wilderness, and the legal and policy difficulties
of protecting wilderness. Considerable time is spent
evaluating current criticisms of the wilderness idea
and practice. Students are involved in a term-long
project involving potential wilderness protection in
Maine. This involves some weekend travel and work
in the Maine woods. Classwork emphasizes hands-on
projects as well as theoretical discussions.

HS 3103 Terrestrial Politics
STABINSKY, DOREEN
This course explores politics of the terrestrial, of
the earth and its defenders, through lenses of both
theory and practice. Through their writings and,
where possible, in direct conversation, we interact
with activists and movements involved in struggles
to protect Earth, land, livelihoods, and community,
and those actively working to build alternatives to
ways of being in the world that they are struggling
against. We also read theoretical reflections on

112

these struggles, drawing from scholars in the fields
of political ecology, political ontology, and political
economy, among others. Locally rooted activities take
place within global economic and political contexts—
markets, international treaties, and other spaces
and places where local and global come into contact,
where ontologies collide, and where different forms
of power are produced and interact across distances.
Course materials and discussion will explore these
global contexts, concrete ways and means by which
economic and political power is contested in these
spaces, and ongoing experiments with and strivings
toward a different world, one where many worlds may
fit. Topics explored include resistance against mining
and other extractive industries, pipeline fights, land
grabbing for agro-industrial expansion, carbon and
biodiversity offset markets, and geoengineering.
Evaluation in the class will be based on preparation
for and participation in class discussions, regular
reflective essays on readings, and a final extended
essay, presentation, or podcast on some aspect of
terrestrial politics.

HS 3104 Are you down with the cause?:
Student Activism in Higher Ed
BLANSETT, RACHEL
Following the founding of the Black Lives Matter
movement in 2013, many colleges have seen an
increase of student protests to address racial injustice
and anti-Blackness at their institutions. Student
protests have also extended outside of race to cover
topics such as gender exclusion and transphobia,
sexual violence and harrassment, student labor and
wage exploitation, lack of institutional resources,
access, representation, and more. Student
activism can be seen used as a response to specific
institutional acts of discrimination and bias while
other movements are being built based around
national and global events (i.e. Black Lives Matter,
#FreePalestine, DACA, etc.). Though we have seen
growth of student unrest on college campuses,
student activism is actually not new and holds a long,
historical legacy in higher education.
This course will provide an overview of how activism
and higher education function together and how
they are dependent on one another to operate.
Additionally, we will examine the ways student
activism has played an integral role in shaping the
foundations and progression of higher education and
academia. We will review the historical context and
importance of student activism on college campuses
and the impact of current events and intersectional
dynamics. We will analyze the influence of student
activism on student learning and retention, the
differences in efficacy between online and offline

activism, and will provide practical skill-building and
praxis towards creating change in higher education
and beyond.
Students will be evaluated based on attendance,
in-class participation and discussion, short topical
research assignments, and a final project. This class
will be hosted virtually with two in-person sessions
(dates to be announced). This will be a hybrid course
offered between Sterling College and College of the
Atlantic.

HS 3105 Policing in Communities of Color
WESSLER, STEPHEN L
This course focuses on policing in communities
of color. We will examine the long and continuing
history of destructive and violent policing toward
Black people in the United States. We will also situate
that history in the context of other ongoing crises
including the decades long war on drugs and the
disproportionate mass incarceration of people of color
in US prisons. The course will especially focus on the
efforts of organizations such as Black Lives Matter
to reduce the high level of deaths of black people at
the hands of police as well as their advocacy for the
defunding of police. We will also examine strategies
to reduce both implicit bias and explicit bias among
police officers, as well as efforts to reduce the distrust
of police in communities of color by training police
in effective skills for de-escalating tense situations.
We will examine recent efforts by the United States
Department of Justice to improve policing by the use
of restraining orders. As a point of comparison, we will
spend some of our time reviewing recent or ongoing
work conducted in Europe to develop and implement
training programs for police officers with the aim to
reduce unnecessary and unlawful violence toward
Roma people. In addition to the readings, students
can expect presentations from and discussions with
guest speakers who have been recently working to
address the harms of police violence, both in the
US and abroad. Student evaluation will be based
on class participation, a series of short written
responses related to readings, a longer form essay or
short fictional story related to a single reading, the
drafting of an opinion-editorial piece regarding the
effectiveness of “defunding” the police, and a written
response to a case study that is coauthored with a
partner.

HS 3106 Blue Food Systems
SMITH, HILLARY
Just three aquatic species account for most seafood
consumed in the US: shrimp, tuna, and salmon. But

worldwide consumption is more diverse, including
an array of finfish, invertebrates, aquatic plants,
algae, and other animals. These blue foods are fished,
collected, gathered, or grown in the sea or freshwater
and play essential roles in supporting human health,
nutrition, livelihoods, and culture. Recent studies
have shown that the top seven categories of nutrientrich, animal-source foods are all aquatic in origin. So
why do food policy and science still heavily focus on
terrestrially produced foods, overlooking blue foods?
This course will unpack this conundrum and examine
blue food systems “from bait to plate” by analyzing
food production, provisioning, and consumption as
interlinked activities. Blue food production includes
small-scale and industrial harvesting and wild capture
and aquaculture systems. Provisioning activities
link production and consumption: the offloading
of catch, storage and transportation of highly
perishable foods, transformations from raw fish to
the final product, and the marketing and distribution
affected to reach consumers. Finally, consumption
includes how we acquire our food, cook and eat it,
and dispose of waste, as well as our nutritional and
health outcomes. While conventional food policy and
science have focused on food production in isolation,
a food systems framework sheds light on dynamics
that impact the flows and distribution of foods with
equity implications: which foods are made by whom,
where does food go, and who benefits? This course
will introduce students to key changes in the goals and
means of food policy, focusing on how the emergent
dialogue on food systems in fisheries is reframing how
we know and govern aquatic resources. A significant
portion of the course will be dedicated to examining
blue food case studies, which may include: seaweed
farming in Tanzania, fishing cooperatives in Mexico,
tuna longliners in the Mid-Atlantic, and lobster fishing
in Maine. Students will work in teams to analyze
one of these case studies in-depth, applying a food
systems lens to examine each case’s sustainability and
equity challenges. Students will be evaluated through
their participation in class discussions and in-class
activities, weekly writing reflections, and co-leading a
class with your case study team. The final project will
be a group policy proposal outlining how stakeholders
could better govern from a food systems perspective
in your blue food case study.
Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: A prior course
on food systems of fisheries is beneficial, but not
required. Students will be (re)introduced to key
concepts in the first few class sessions and apply them
throughout the course. Class limit: 15. Lab fee: None

HS 3107 Community-based Climate

Climate change poses an existential threat to life as
we know it. This class’s goal is to move beyond the
paralyzing and frustrating national and international

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

113

policy making related to climate change and to
focus on what can be done at a community level.
The broad impacts of climate change do not lend
themselves to narrow disciplinary solutions—they
require an integrated human ecological approach
that brings together multiple disciplines and varied
problem solving skills. This project-oriented course
will create the opportunity for advanced students
to study and design real-world, practical solutions
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
adapting to the impacts of climate change. Student
teams will design a project in collaboration with
a community, government, business, or nonprofit
partner. All projects will consider issues of feasibility,
implementation, equity, and innovation as they
design their solution. This course is practical, highly
interactive, and hands on. Experts from nonprofits,
COA staff, and the local community will be involved in
project planning and will participate in class sessions.
Lectures will provide background material pertinent
to the specific project. In addition to lectures/
discussions and regular team meetings, there will be
significant fieldwork (e.g., mapping, data collection,
meetings with experts and community liaisons,
charrettes, presentations, and collaboration with
community partners). To enroll in the class, students
need to possess the academic skills necessary to do
independent, advanced work. A background in climate
change, law, GIS, data analysis, planning, design,
ecology, economics, business, social science research,
or writing would be helpful. Physics and Mathematics
of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Law
and Policy are highly recommended. Students will
be evaluated on the quality of their group work,
participation in teams and class discussions, and
quality of written and oral presentations.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites:
Advanced work at COA or at another college. Class
limit: 16. Lab fee: $45

HS 3108 Creative Nonfiction Workshop:
Personal into the Cultural
GREENBERG, ARIELLE
In this workshop, students will have the opportunity
to experiment with style, form and voice in the
genre of literary nonfiction, all while working
toward a lively final piece. The course will center
around three short creative nonfiction projects, all
driven by your individual interests and experiences.
The two initial projects—a personal essay/memoir
and a piece of nontraditional cultural criticism—
will inform the final one, modeled after the
irreverent and highly subjective New York Times
Letters of Recommendation feature, which places
autobiographical anecdote within a larger cultural
context. We will read short examples of each kind of
essay but the bulk of the class would be developing
and workshopping students’ own work. Students
will be guided toward finding meaningful, unusual
114

topics that suit their own passions, and will be given
instruction in the foundations of good prose writing,
including grammatical style, diction, structure and
revision strategies, all of which are useful skills for
composition and creative writing in general.

writing creative and academic prose; familiarity and
comfort with the writing workshop model. Class limit:

HS 3109 Food and War Part I
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
Food systems have long been globalized and
interconnected. Consequently, conflict in one part of
the world often affects food systems in other parts
of the world. Indeed, some scholars have argued
that war has made our contemporary food systems.
In this course, we will draw on the fields of food
studies, history, anthropology, international studies,
and political science to understand how war has
shaped and been shaped by past and contemporary
food systems. Designed as a two part course, Food
& War Part I focuses on World War I, World War
II, and the Cold War between the United States,
the Soviet Union, and their respective allies. We
will also examine the influence of the Cold War on
efforts to bring about a “green revolution” across
Asia in the 1950s and 1960s and across Africa
today. Throughout the term we will consider how
modern war tactics have evolved from historical
approaches to conflict, from burning and salting
fields to slaughtering livestock and wild game. As
a reading- and discussion-based course, we will
primarily examine our topic through books and peerreviewed articles as we consider the questions: How
has food been used as both a weapon of war and a
tool of diplomacy? How has conflict transformed the
ways people grow, harvest, and eat food? And how
have agricultural methods, inputs, technologies, and
cuisines spread and evolved in relationship to war?
Students will be evaluated based on preparation
for, and participation in, class discussions, a series
of synthesis papers, and a final paper. As an
intermediate seminar, this course is best suited for
students who have taken a course in food studies
such as Transforming Food Systems or US Farm &
Food Policy, and who have had at least one course
in history, anthropology, or international studies.
Students who take Food & War Part I are not required
to take Part II.
Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: This course is
best suited for students who have taken a course in
food studies such as Transforming Food Systems or
US Farm & Food Policy, and who have had at least
one course in history, anthropology, or international
studies. Class limit: 16. Lab fee: $0. Meets the

HS 4012 Contemporary Women’s Novels
WALDRON, KAREN
This course selects from among the most interesting,
diverse and well-written of contemporary women’s
fiction to focus on questions of women’s writing (and
how/whether it can be treated as a literary and formal
category), gender identity and women’s issues, the
tension between sameness and difference among
women’s experiences, and narrations of women’s
experience around the world. The course begins
by examining two relatively unknown yet rather
extraordinary novels from earlier in the twentieth
century: Alexandra Kollantai’s Love of Worker Bees
(1927) and Sawako Ariyoshi’s The Doctor’s Wife (1967).
After these, we read from truly contemporary authors
and quite varied authors published within the last 20
years, like Buchi Emecheta, Gloria Naylor, Ursula Hegi,
Nawal El Saadawi, Sue Grafton, Graciela Limon, Tsitsi
Dargarembga, Barara Yoshimoto, Dorothy Allison,
Rose Tremain, Julia Alvarez, Leslie Feinberg, April
Sinclair, and Achy Obejas. Students each choose an
additional author to study and read a novel outside
of class. An extensive list of authors is included in the
syllabus. Evaluation be based on class participation,
either two short papers or one long paper on works
discussed in class, a presentation to the class of the
outside novel, and a final evaluation essay.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisite: a
previous literature course and signature of the

HS 4020 Environmentality: Power,
Knowledge, and Ecology
MCKOWN, JAMIE
Bringing critical theory directly to the gates of human
ecology, this class will approach the central issue
of how discourses of government, biopower, and
geopower have intertwined and infused themselves
within the representations of “environments” in
popular debate. With a specific nod to Foucault, Marx,
Baudrillard, Luke, and other critical social theorists,
we will tackle the various complexities that arise when
ecology become a site for political and economic
expertization.
Topics to be covered include the formation
of knowledge/power/discourse, systems of
environmentality, the rise of hyperecology, the
valorization of ecodisciplinarians, and, as Timothy
Luke puts it, “how discourses of nature, ecology
or the environment, as disciplinary articulations of
ecoknowledge, can be mobilized by professionaltechnical experts in contemporary polyarchies to
generate geopower over nature for the megatechnical
governance of modern economies and societies.”
The class will also address the question of “moving
forward,” and how these critiques can open productive
spaces for new ways of representing modernity and

ecology. The class will be highly interactive; discussion
will be the primary mode instruction, and students
will have considerable influence on the exact topics
covered. Final evaluation will based on a combination
of class participation, a series of analytical response
papers, and two long-form essays. While the class is
open to all students, those with some background in
critical theory, philosophy, or economic theory are
encouraged to attend.

This course will cover the process of new venture
creation for students interested in creating
businesses or nonprofits with substantial social and
environmental benefit. It is designed for student
teams who have an idea and want to go through
the formal process of examining and launching the
enterprise. Topics covered in this course will include:
opportunity recognition, market research, creating
a business plan, producing financial projections, and
venture financing. As part of the course, all students

HS 4026 Environmental Law and Policy
CLINE, KEN
This course provides an overview of environmental
law and the role of law in shaping environmental
policy. We examine, as background, the nature
and scope of environmental, energy, and resource
problems and evaluate the various legal mechanisms
available to address those problems. The course
attempts to have students critically analyze the role
of law in setting and implementing environmental
policy. We explore traditional common law
remedies, procedural statutes such as the National
Environmental Policy Act, intricate regulatory
schemes, and market-based strategies that have
been adopted to control pollution and protect natural
resources. Students are exposed to a wide range of
environmental law problems in order to appreciate
both the advantages and limitations of law in this
context. Special attention is given to policy debates
currently underway and the use of the legal process to
foster the development of a sustainable society in the
United States. Students are required to complete four
problem sets in which they apply legal principles to a
given fact scenario.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites:
Introduction to the Legal Process or Philosophy of the
Constitution strongly recommended. Offered at least
every other year. Class limit: 20. Lab fee $10. Meets

HS 4028 Cross-Cultural American Women’s
Novels
WALDRON, KAREN
This is an intermediate/advanced course in which
students will explore in depth the connections
between and among modern and cross-cultural
women’s novels, primarily those written in the now
very multi-cultural United States. We will strive to
make connections between texts so as to better
understand the nature of and any patterns or themes
that shape women’s and cross-cultural fictional
narration. Historical perspective, cultural differences,
and gender roles will all be taken into consideration
as we analyze relatively recent women’s fiction by
such authors such as Toni Morrison, Maxine Hong
Kingston, Gloria Naylor, Linda Hogan, Julie Shikeguni,
Jamaica Kincaid, Nora Okja Keller, Cristina Garcia,
Jhumpa Lahiri, and Sigrid Nunez. Participants will
read carefully, prepare and ask questions of each
other, write frequent response papers, and carry out a
sustained independent project to be presented to the
group. The outside project will focus on one or more
additional texts that may be fictional, theoretical,
cultural, or historic. The group presentation will
put outside texts into broad cultural and historical
perspectives and/or discuss them in terms of
trends in women’s literature, immigrant literature,
women’s literature of the United States, multicultural
narratives, or some other course theme. Selection of
the outside text will give participants the opportunity
to fill in perceived gaps in their reading or explore
a particular narrative or cultural form in depth.
The reading load for this course is relatively heavy.
Evaluation will focus on preparation, participation,
insight, critical thinking, response papers, and the
outside project—both its oral presentation and
development in an appropriate form (visual, narrative,
analytic, curricular, etc.).
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites: A
previous literature course and permission of the
instructor; experience withcontemporary women’s
novels recommended. Class limit: 15. Lab fee: None.

HS 4042 Reading the West
ANDERSON, JOHN
The spectacular range of habitats between the Pacific
Ocean and the Great Basin and Sonoran Deserts has
generated some of the most significant place-based
writing within American literature. In this intensive
field-based course students will be required to read a
range of materials dealing with key places. people, and
events in the western landscape during the summer
prior to the formal start of the course. The class will
then convene in California and begin a trek eastwards
into the Great Basin Desert, south to the Carson/
Iceberg Wilderness, Yosemite, the Hetch Hetchy
Valley and Mono Lake, and then finally southeastward
116

across the Sonoran desert to Albuquerque, New
Mexico, where students and faculty will participate
in a conference celebrating the first 50 years of the
Wilderness Act. Readings will include work by Muir,
Didion, Steinbeck, and Fremont. Evaluation will consist
of class participation, a series of essays and journal
essays, and a final term paper that will be completed
following the end of the field portion of the course.
This course will be integrated with and requires
co-enrollment in Ecology and Natural History of the
American West and Wilderness in the West.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites:
Permission of instructor, camping/backpacking ability.

HS 4043 Wilderness in the West: Promise
and Problems
CLINE, KEN
Wilderness has been the clarion call for generations
of environmentalists. In a letter in support of the
Wilderness Act, writer Wallace Stegner characterized
the importance of wilderness as an essential “part
of the geography of hope.” That single phrase and
the current controversy surrounding the concept
of wilderness provide the central focus of our
explorations of wilderness in western lands. This
course examines the question of wilderness from
multiple perspectives in the hopes of providing an
understanding of both the concept and real spaces
that constitute wilderness. Through conversations
with wilderness managers, field work, and experience
in federally designated wilderness areas in national
parks, national forests, wildlife refuges, and on BLM
lands, the course will also examine what wilderness
management means on the ground in the varied
landscapes of the western United States. In this
context, we look at historical and contemporary
accounts of the value of wilderness, ecological and
cultural arguments for wilderness, and the legal
and policy difficulties of protecting wilderness.
Considerable time is spent evaluating current
criticisms of the wilderness idea and practice.
The class will culminate at a week-long national
conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the Wilderness Act. The 50th Anniversary National
Wilderness Conference provides an incomparable
opportunity for students to hear from and interact
with federal management agencies, academics,
recreation experts, and environmental advocacy
organizations. Presenting their final course work at
this conference will also give students an opportunity
to share their ideas and to receive valuable feedback
from this sophisticated and well-informed audience
of wilderness experts. Classwork emphasizes handson service-learning projects as well as reading,
writing, and theoretical discussions. Students will be
evaluated on journal entries, contributions to the class
discussions, response rapers, engagement in field

HS 4047 Waste
VAN VLIET, NETTA
The term “waste” has varied definitions. It can
suggest excess material not put to use, garbage,
time or objects that are not made productive or
useful, and that which is thrown away. Waste is both
a verb and a noun, and the term often carries moral
or ethical undertones; time should not be wasted,
neither should food nor material goods, and of
course, life itself should not be wasted. Waste should
be reduced or transformed through consumption or
recycling. Waste can occasion disgust and outrage,
but even if less acknowledged, also fascination,
desire, and pleasure. Time spent idle is often time
considered wasted. Waste is also often understood as
destructive and as the product of destruction. At the
same time, waste can also be a necessary by product
of its opposites. Psychoanalysis has drawn attention
to feces association with gold and the notion of
the gift of waste in the formation of subjectivity.
Political economy, postcolonial studies, anthropology,
and feminist theory have all addressed histories
of abjection, notions of excrement, disposable
populations, and the ways in which humans have
dealt with literal waste and those materials and lives
that become understood as waste. In this regard,
understandings of waste have been central for
notions of value, productivity, desire, cleanliness and
filth, inside and outside, and the place of difference.
In this course, we will examine some of the varied
ways in which waste has been understood—in terms
of political economy, political theory, postcolonial
studies, and feminist theory, addressing waste in
terms of identity, the natural environment, value, and
the formation of what counts as human. Readings
will include texts by Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Georges
Bataille, Julia Kristeva, Sigmund Freud, Dominque
Laporte, Mary Douglas, Jacques Lacan, Norman
O. Brown, Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins, William
Rathje and Cullen Murphy, Kathleen Millar, Hannah
Arendt, Carl Schmitt, Kevin Bales, Paul Ricoeur,
Ranjana Khanna, and Françoise Vergès. Students
will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class
participation, reading responses, and two short
analytical essays.

HS 4052 Economic Development: Theory
and Case Studies
TAYLOR, DAVIS
Economic growth in the developing world has
lifted millions out of poverty at the same time that
misguided attempts at widespread application
of generic economic development theories has
impoverished millions. As a result of this tragedy,
new approaches and methodologies to economic
development are emerging, and represent some
of the most important, dynamic, and controversial
theories in all of economics. This course examines
these new perspectives on economic development.
We will briefly contextualize the new by reviewing
“old” economic development, then move on to
theories that emphasize very place-based, countryspecific approaches to how economies develop; this
will involve examining the specific roles of capital
accumulation, capital flows (including foreign
exchange, portfolio capital, foreign direct investment,
and microfinance), human capital, governance,
institutions (especially property rights, legal systems,
and corruption), geography and natural resource
endowments, industrial policy (e.g. free trade
versus dirigiste policies), spillovers, clustering, and
entrepreneurship. The course will involve a rigorous
mix of economic modeling, careful application of
empirical data (including both historical analysis and
cross-sectional studies; students with no exposure to
econometrics will receive a brief introduction), and
country studies. Evaluation will be based on classroom
participation, responses to reading questions, short
essays, and a final project consisting of an economic
development country study of the student’s choice
that demonstrates application of theoretical concepts
to the real world.

HS 4053 Economics of Cooperation,
Networks, and Trust
TAYLOR, DAVIS
Economics is slowly expanding from equilibriumbased, atomistic optimization, through dyadic
strategic interaction, to the consideration of networks
and complexity. At the same time, it is beginning
to incorporate more complex human motivations
beyond simple optimization as means of explaining
economic outcomes. This course captures these
trends by the study of the economics of cooperation,
networks, and trust. We will focus on four major
ways of understanding cooperation: individual
optimization, strategic optimization, institutions,
and embedded social relationships (networks),
and we will apply cooperation to the contexts of
commonly held resources (such as fisheries and
climate), networks and strategic alliances, and

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

117

formal economic organizations (cooperatives).
After an introduction to the relevant issues and an
examination of the standard neoclassical approach
of optimization (with cooperation as part of the
choice set), we will enrich our understanding of group
cooperation through the examination of social capital,
tacit knowledge, and common pool resources. We
will then have a brief exposure to game theoretic
approaches to conceptualizing strategic behavior,
along with graph theory as a means of conceptualizing
networks. With these tools in hand, we will examine
the role of networks in economic contexts such as
the networks of Emilia Romagna, the Mondragón
complex, and worker-owned businesses in the United
States and Canada. This course will be of interest to
students interested in business and organizational
management, natural resource management,
sociology, community development, globalization,
social movements, economic democracy, and a host of
other topics. Evaluation will be based on participation
in classroom discussions, several major assignments,
and responses to reading questions. We will
collaboratively decide on a final project; possibilities
innclude poster presentations, a community
presentation, or a jointly produced research or policy
paper.

HS 4054 Philosophies of Love
COX, GRAY
This course investigates the intellectual history of
concepts of love that provide origins for notions of
it being central in our time. Is love the key to giving
meaning to our individual lives? Is it a transformative
power that can empower and heal us and our
societies? How are the many different concepts of it
related? To what extent are these concepts grounded
in biological, historical, philosophical or spiritual
truths—or mere reflections of collective myths, self
delusions, or manipulative deceptions? How can we
as individuals most fully realize ourselves? How can
our society best promote flourishing lives and how
can this be brought about? The theme of love winds
like an Ariadnean thread through the labyrinth of
the history of ideas about the nature of self, Other,
community, knowledge, reality, and ethics. The class
uses overview materials from intellectual historians
like de Rougemont, Singer, and May. It picks away
through central passages in that labyrinth by reading
key selections from Plato, New Testament writers,
Medieval poets, Nietzsche, de Beauvoir, Irigary,
Gandhi, King, Levinas, Thich Nhat Hanh, MortimerSandilands, pop culture, and others. Class format
relies on seminar discussion with occasional short
lectures. Goals of the course are to advance students’
abilities to critically analyze texts in context in
intellectual history, and to advance understanding of
118

nuanced ways key ideas in epistemology, metaphysics,
ethics, and social-change theories inform and are
informed by concepts including: eros, philia, agape,
courtly love (fin amour), love force/satyagraha,
romantic love, ahimsa, and compassion. Students will
be responsible for leading seminar sessions. There
will be one problem set, two short papers and a term
project presented in class as well as developed in a
final paper of 15-20 pages. Includes a lab session for
viewing films and television and discussing student
work.

HS 4056 Histories of Race
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
Race as a concept was constructed in the Western
world in the early modern era as commentary on
and explanation of human differences. This class
will examine the origins of the idea of race and the
ways it is central to the creation of the modern world.
Drawing on histories of Europe and the Americas this
class will look at the different ways racialized thinking
was deployed in colonial contexts. Central themes of
the course will be the history of race as an idea, the
nature and impact of the Atlantic slave trade, how
indigenous peoples reshaped European ideas of what
it meant to be human, the construction of whiteness,
and the history of slavery in the new world. The period
covered by the class spans from the origins of race
as an idea to the late 19th century. The course will be
a hybrid of a lecture course and a readings seminar.
Students will read major works in the field and develop
an understanding of the historical background of
contemporary forms of structural inequality justified
and reinforced by racialized thinking. Students will
do a series of short assignments, lead discussion of
books, and undertake a major research paper. The
research projects will allow students to explore topics
beyond the chronological and spatial scope of the
course.

This course explores selected themes in ecological
economics, which is both the economics of
sustainability and resilience as well as a paradigmatic
approach distinct from mainstream neoclassical
economics. We will use the first several weeks of the
term to define and outline ecological economics.
We will use the remainder of the term to explore

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

relevant current topics; possible themes include
climate change, fossil fuels and renewable energy,
green technology and investment, ecosystem
conservation (ecosystem services, payment for
ecosystem services), biophysical constraints to
economic growth (technological optimism/pessimism,
the precautionary principle, rebound effects and
Jevon’s Paradox), sociocultural impacts of economic
growth (consumption, happiness studies), system
dynamics (steady state economy, critical transitions in
complex systems, resiliency), common pool resources
(fisheries, climate, forests), measurement issues
(growth versus development, ecological footprint,
Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare), political
economy and political ecology (land grabbing,
violence), methodological issues (post-normal science,
transdisciplinarity), institutional arrangements, trade
and development (embodied trade in energy and
water, pollution havens), community sustainability
(localization, commoning), philosophical issues
(Buddhist economics, Gandhian economics, homo
economicus, feminist economics), and degrowth.
Evaluation will be via four short essays, a final poster
presentation, and classroom engagement.

HS 4069 Leaving Capitalism
TAYLOR, DAVIS
Markets are the dominant form of economic
organization in the world today: particularly in the
Global North, the vast majority of people sell their
specialized labor to earn money, and use the money
to obtain, via markets, the goods and services they
need or desire. However, since the earliest days
of capitalistic production, there were voices that
articulated deep-seated critiques of capitalism while
finding value in non-commodified production and
consumption. These voices are still with us today,
along with those who seek to act on such critiques
by meeting much of their material needs through
non-market means such as self-production, acts
of reciprocity, and, and gift exchange. This course
examines theories, concepts, and experiences
centered on this practice of “leaving capitalism:”
seeking food, shelter, and clothing to the greatest
degree possible through non-commodified production
and consumption, in places where commodified
production and consumption are the dominant
norms. We will examine counter-hegemonic activities,
particularly homesteading, that seek to restore visible,
non-exploitive relationships to production activities,
thus challenging commodity fetishism and alienation
(in Marxist terms) and narrow definitions of economic
efficiency (in Neoclassical terms). We will lean heavily
on theories and case studies of diverse/community/
solidarity economies as articulated by JK Gibson-

Graham, Ethan Miller, and others; other topics will
include capitalism (alienation and commodification),
Buddhist/ Gandhian economics (which emphasizes
local economies, community self-reliance), work
(the nature of work, what constitutes good work),
resistance/avoidance (James C. Scott), and degrowth.
By studying and integrating these ideas as they relate
to production, consumption, and social relations, we
will also seek to redefine contemporary economics
beyond its traditional emphasis on commodity
production, restoring the “social” to this social
science. Evaluation will be based on problem sets,
participation, engagement in classroom discussions
and field experiences, and a final poster presentation.

HS 4079 Skills for Conflict Resolution and
Advocacy on Human Rights
WESSLER, STEPHEN L
The course provides students with skills and strategies
for conflict resolution and advocacy on human rights
and social justice issues. Students will practice leading
focus groups, facilitating conflict resolution dialogues,
conducting workshops, and developing workshop
agendas and curricula. Students will also explore
strategies for effective advocacy by examining case
studies from the instructor’s work on human rights
and social justice issues in Europe and the US and
from the work of other advocates. Advocates from
Europe or the US will present either in person or by
Skype. Students may be able to observe active conflict
resolution or advocacy projects in Maine during the
term. Students will be evaluated on their work during
practice sessions on conflict resolution and on other
skills relating to advocacy on human rights issues,
their written analysis of case studies, their final
project, and their participation in class discussions.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites:
Coursework addressing conflict resolution or

HS 4085 Writing Your Novella
CASS, BLAKE
Although the novella remains one of the most
underappreciated and misunderstood literary genres,
its structural brevity offers students the ideal form
to study how to create long-form fiction. Class time
will be primarily devoted to discussing the novellas we
have read. Texts may include Seize the Day by Saul
Bellow, The Grownup by Gillian Flynn, Neighbors by
Lilia Momple, Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfo, and Indian

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

Nocturne by Antonio Tabucchi. During class, we will
look at strategies of dialogue, point-of-view, plot, and
setting. Students will learn how other writers develop
characters with precision, fluidly integrate backstory
and flashbacks into narratives, and make use of the
three narrative modes: full scene, half scene, and
summary narration.
To help establish a routine of writing, students will
sign up for daily work periods in the writing center.
Some work periods will start with a prompt to help
students focus their imaginations on specific aspects
of their stories, but most work periods will primarily
be dedicated to individual writing. By maintaining
a habit of writing and reflecting throughout the
course on their progress, students will develop a
process of writing that works for them. By the end
of the course, each student will be expected to hand
in a polished first draft ranging between 20,000 to
50,000 words. Shorter novellas will go through more
extensive revision than longer novellas. Students will
be evaluated on their participation in class and their
ability to execute narrative strategies in their novellas.

HS 4086 Derrida and Questions of
Difference
VAN VLIET, NETTA
Algerian Jewish philosopherJacques Derrida (19302004), one of the most widely translated French
philosophers of the 20th century, developed a
body of work often referred to as deconstruction.
Derrida’s oeuvre has influenced multiple fields
and disciplines, including literature, anthropology,
philosophy, postcolonial studies, psychoanalysis,
and feminist Theory. This course will track some
of the ways in which Derrida engaged with ideas of
difference, through a focus on questions his work
poses for understandings of the human. The class will
engage with Derrida’s archive through reading some
of his early work, including essays and interviews
about the status of writing and speech, language,
and philosophy, and then move through his later
work, including his increasing focus on explicitly
political topics such as the death Peñalty, the animal,
sovereignty, and war. Although the texts we read
will be primarily Derrida’s own writing, we will also
read authors who respond to and build on Derrida’s
thought. These may include Gayatri Spivak, Ranjana
Khanna, Samir Haddad, Peggy Kamuf, and Michael
Naas, as well as texts by those with whom Derrida was
in dialogue, such as Sigmund Freud, Hélène Cixous,
Michel Foucault, Sarah Kofman, Claude Lévi-Strauss,
Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger, and Emmanuel Levinas.
As we move through Derrida’s texts and those
informed by them, we will pay particular attention to
120

questions about sexual difference, colonialism, the
human, death in relation to life, and representation.
Students will be evaluated on participation in seminar
discussions, weekly reading responses, and midterm
and final papers. There are no prerequisites for this
course, but students will be expected to conduct
close readings of challenging texts. Students are
encouraged to contact the professor with any
questions about the course and whether it is a good fit
for them.

HS 4087 History Workshop: Wabanaki
Studies
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
This class will be an empirically-based research
seminar on the history, politics, archaeology, and
culture of Maine’s Wabanaki tribes that tackles a wide
range of issues. The class will consist of several group
projects on topics such as cataloging indigenous
place names to the loss of cultural heritage sites due
to coastal erosion. After completing several of these
projects, students will develop their own research
project on Wabanaki history and culture that they
will conceptualize, plan, and carry out. The class
will also cover the themes of colonialism, cultural
revitalization, tribal sovereignty, preservation of
cultural resources, and much more. The course will be
based on projects developed in consultation with tribal
cultural preservation specialists and tribal historians
from Maine’s Wabanaki communities. Final projects, so
long as they have a historical component, can explore
a topic of the student’s choosing in consultation with
the faculty. This class is appropriate for students
from a range of backgrounds. Previous coursework
such as Indigenous America, Native American Law,
Race and Racism in America, the Yucatán program, or
other relevant courses will be extremely helpful, and
preference will be given to students who have some
previous academic background in historical research,
Indigenous studies, and ethnography. Students who
have taken classes with a strong component of textual
analysis of historical sources are also encouraged
to take the class. Students will learn to work with
both primary and secondary sources (both written
and visual). Students will be evaluated on their
contribution to the group projects, participation in
discussion, several small assignments, and their final
project.

TUROK, KATHARINE
Displacement, disappearance, deportation, exile,
and return in new writing: how do storytellers
relate, relive, and re-create displacement from war,
emigration, anti-immigration discourses, voluntary
or coerced exile, or racial, ethnic, and religious
conflicts? What emotional truths do new novels,
poems, short stories, and essays reflect—from anger,
to “otherness,” to nostalgia, to numbness—when the
self and its homeland are separated? Are one or more
homelands foundational to identity formation? How
do fiction and nonfiction convey refugee experiences
and their aftermath? Finally, how are migratory
journeys of geography and selfhood accompanied by
related trauma, impactful on different generations
and changes in the social and political spectrum—and
do they evolve as “a disassembly of the heart and
excavation of a new identity” in recent writing?
Readings include material by 21st century writers from
every continent, such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,
Claire G. Coleman, Daša Drndic, Isabella Hammad,
Cristina Henríquez, Amitav Kumar, Kyun-sook Shin,
Valeria Luiselli, Geovani Martins, Imbolo Mbue, Viet

HS 4092 The Measure of Our Lives: Toni
Morrison Seminar
WALDRON, KAREN
This course will be an intermediate/advanced seminar
honoring and exploring the works of Toni Morrison
(1931–2019), an African-American author who won
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, the Pulitzer
Prize for Fiction in 1988, and numerous other notable
awards. She was a giant of a public intellectual and
contemporizing figure in American Literature; her
works continue to inspire and transform readers
and scholars of all identities, although her primary
purpose was to write for Black people. As Morrison
herself said, “If there is a book that you want to read,
but it hasn’t been written yet, you must be the one to
write it.” In writing she changed the literary landscape
of the US. In particular, her poetics illustrate how
African American and especially African American
women authors express depths of meaning and
experience absolutely central to any understanding of
the complex culture and histories of the US. Another
Morrison quote hints at the profundity of her own view
of her life’s work: “We die. That may be the meaning
of life. But we do language. That may be the measure

of our lives.” These two quotes provide a framework
for the course, which seeks students interested in
language and its power, literature and its insights, and
the Black female experience. Over the course of the
term students will read through Morrison’s oeuvre of
novels (The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar
Baby, Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Love, A Mercy, Home,
God Help the Child) as well as a number of her key
essays and addresses (Playing in the Dark, The Source
of Self-Regard), scholarly criticism, and responses to
Morrison’s 2019 passing. There may be some division
of labor with the later novels (after Paradise), but the
course is reading intensive. Students will also prepare
frequent short written responses and a final project
responding to Morrison in some way. Evaluation will
be based on class participation, response papers,
passage analysis, and the final Morrison project to be
shared with the class.

of poetry and short fiction, though there will also
be a place for Starting Your Novel students to
finish up. Our goal is to develop the skills of verbal
craftsmanship and self-criticism. Class meetings
combine the analysis and critique of individual
student’s writing with the discussions of published
works by other writers. We also frequently discuss
matters of standards, the creative process, and the
situation of the writer in the contemporary world.
Students are expected to submit one piece each week,
to participate in class response to fellow writers, to
make revisions on all work, and to contribute their
best pieces to the printed class anthology at the end
of the term.

machine learning, evolutionary programming, etc.
Sample topics include roles of AI in education, health,
agriculture, transportation, policing, military, scientific
research, the arts, spiritual traditions, religions,
government, language translation, and bridging
relations between different cultures.
Goals are to develop: understandings of the basic
programming principles, research, development
strategies and underlying philosophical assumptions
guiding development in such technologies; abilities to
use interdisciplinary, problem-centered approaches
to understand complicated vs. “wicked” problems
associated with rapid technological change and key
approaches to dealing with them; collaborative skills
for problem-centered studies and programming
projects in AI in areas of student interest; and metacognitive abilities to learn these kinds of material in
groups as well as on your own.

Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites:
A readiness to engage with theoretical models,
methodological techniques, basic programming, and
philosophical questions in disciplined and critical
ways. There is no specific course requirement for this
class. However, it will assume students are familiar
with at least some of the key issues raised in the
course. Permission of the instructor. Class limit:15. Lab
fee: $35. Meets the following degree requirements: HS

WALDRON, KAREN

Readings will include classic texts in AI theory,
philosophy, and futures studies as well as selections
from standard texts on AI programming like that
of Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. We will also
use podcasts, films, and other media to pursue key
topics and trends. There will be a series of short
programming activities to study basic principles
and try modelling aspects of more complicated and/
or complex systems. These will be done, at least
initially, in block coding accessible to students without
previous programming experience. We will examine
the ways in which they can be coded in Python and
students familiar with that or other languages will be
able to pursue homework and final project work in
whatever language they may prefer.

122

Evaluation will be based on the extent to which
students demonstrate in homework, class
participation, and term projects that they have
advanced in each of the four main goals for the
course.

HS 4099 Contemporary Black Writers

Students pursue term projects individually or
collaboratively which may include: futures studies
use of methods of historical and/or social science
research to investigate some emerging AI-related
social or environmental concern; a computer
programming project that solves a practical problem,
is conducive to artistic expression, performs scientific
analysis of quantitative data, or demonstrates an
established or experimental feature of a machine
learning or otherwise AI system; or a philosophical
and/or theoretical critical analysis of underlying
concepts, values or assumptions that are at stake in
the emerging AI technologies.

Class sessions and labs will vary in format from
extended discussion of texts and problems to

supplementary lecture, visiting speakers, collaborative
coding activities, and extended project work. The class
as a group will develop at least one major hackathon
style project as a way of exploring key issues and
developing key skills.

This literature course allows students to explore
the rich world of modern and contemporary Black
writers. The texts will include those from the US
and beyond, in an attempt to sample the wide range
of fabulous prose authors (primarily novelists and
essayists) that speak from and about the experiences
of a significant segment of the world’s population.
Similarities and differences between prose styles
and narrative focus will allow us to probe aesthetic
and linguistic as well as cultural and historical
phenomena and contexts. While the emphasis will be
on works written since 2000, we will begin the term
by reading a few 20th century authors who paved
the way for the artistry which was to follow—choosing
among writers such as Ann Petry, Gwendolyn Brooks,
Octavia Butler, and James Baldwin from the US, and
Chinua Achebe, Bessie Head, and Ama Ata Aidoo
from the African continent. Earlier selections will
set us up with questions about the fiction and prose
literary articulation coming from both post-slavery
and postcolonial contexts. The remainder of the
term we will read 21st century works by authors such
as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi, Colson Whitehead,
Ta-nehisi Coates, Yaa Gyasi, Zadie Smith, Jessmyn
Ward, and Nnedi Okorafor. Students will be evaluated
on class participation, shared discussion leading
responsibilities, and written work. Each student will
choose one of three options for written work: four
2-3 page critical analyses; two 5-7 page studies of a
particular work or theme; or a 12-15 page extended
analysis of one or two works or authors.
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites: A
previous literature, history, or post-colonial course,

HS 4100 Carbon
STABINSKY, DOREEN
Carbon is the building block of life. It is also central
to one of the most critical challenges of this century:
climate change. Combustion of fossilized carbon
leads to the increase in atmospheric concentrations
of carbon dioxide that threaten life across the planet.
Trees and other living organisms that store carbon
are celebrated as solutions to the growing crisis, yet
rampant destruction of these carbon stores continues
unabated. The global management of carbon and its
impacts includes projects to decarbonize economies
and recarbonize ecologies, as well as fantastical
technofixes for carbon removal and blocking the sun.
Who will decide how much fossil carbon ultimately
gets burned? How much land will be claimed by elites
to soak up their continued fossil emissions, and where
will it be located? What role do carbon markets and
geoengineering play in addressing or perpetuating
fossil economies? These are some of the questions we
will explore.
In the course we use several different theoretical
lenses that look at intersections of institutions,
nature, economy, and power (critical geography,
political ecology, political economy) to understand
more deeply the political, economic, and ecological
relationships that emerge around forms of carbon
(fossil fuels, trees and landscapes, monoculture
plantations) in the context of global efforts to address
climate change. Topics to be covered include: the
carbon cycle; carbon economies of coal, oil, and
gas; international climate treaties and global politics
of governing carbon; carbon markets; climate
models; geoengineering and carbon removal; carbon
democracy and fossil capital. The aim of the inquiry,
and what students should expect to take away from
the course, is experience in engaging with theoretical
texts and a broader and deeper understanding of the
global political economy and local political ecologies
of climate change and carbon. Readings will come
from academic as well as non-academic literature
from think tanks, non-governmental organizations,
and social movements. The course will be conducted
in a seminar format, with emphasis on class discussion
of readings. Students will be evaluated based on
engagement in class discussions, regular writing
assignments, leading one or more class discussions,
and a final project (podcast, presentation, or final
synthetic essay).
Level: Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisites: One or
more courses in natural or physical sciences, social
theory, economics and/or politics. Class limit: 12. Lab

HS 4101 Troubadours, Nuns, Concubines,
and Witches before 1500
TUROK, KATHARINE
This course traces variations in the social, legal,
political, and economic status of women in Asia and
Europe from antiquity to about 1500. Students will
examine letters, diaries, songs, artwork and artifacts,
court documents, poems, essays, and fiction primarily
by and about women. Students will also consider such
questions as: Why and to what extent did women in
some parts of the world—China, southern India, Japan,
Catalonia—experience relative freedom? What were
women’s attitudes toward sexuality, men, children,
religion, love, work, magic, and education? How was
gender negotiated, with female identity in girlhood,
adolescence, and adulthood established or modified,
within various sociocultural contexts? What were
the achievements and accomplishments of women
during these early periods, whether they managed
households and property, wandered the land as
minstrels, practiced medicine, worked at court, in
the religious life, in the visual and performing arts,
or as political leaders such as pharaohs, priests, and
emperors. Students will be evaluated on the basis
of class participation, two short papers, and one
substantial essay.

HS 5012 Wildlife Law Seminar
CLINE, KEN
In his seminal essay on the “Land Ethic,” Aldo
Leopold explores the incongruity between man’s
legal structures and the natural world around him.
This incongruity is particularly acute in the area
of wildlife conservation. This course examines the
legal, philosophical, scientific, economic, and political
problems surrounding man’s relationship with other
species on this planet. The far-reaching goals and
impacts of the Endangered Species Act are a central
focus of the course. Significant time is also dedicated

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

123

to legal issues concerning marine mammals, Native
Americans’ wildlife concerns, migratory birds, animal
rights, and agencies entrusted to manage wildlife.
The growing role of international agreements
to protect migratory and commercially valuable
species is also covered. Special attention is given
to debates currently underway over reauthorizing
the Endangered Species Act and pending biological
diversity legislation. Students are engaged in a termlong project that attempts to apply the principles
of the course to a pressing wildlife issue in Maine.
Evaluation is based on class participation and
contribution to the group project.

HS 5013 Methods of Teaching Writing
Across the Curriculum
CASS, BLAKE
This course not only gives students knowledge and
understanding of rhetorical theory and practice so
they can work effectively with developing writers, but
also provides them with a review of grammar, methods
of evaluating writing, and strategies for teaching
exposition, argument, and persuasion. Students put
this knowledge to practical use by working as peer
tutors in the writing center. Students participate in
this course for one academic year and receive one
credit. In addition to Williams’ Style: Ten Lessons in
Clarity and Grace and Irmscher’s Teaching Expository
Writing, students read numerous articles from College
Composition and Communication, College English,
The Writing Instructor, Language Arts, and English
Journal, and Research in the Teaching of English, as
well as a text dealing with teaching writing in their
specialty, e.g. Writing Themes about Literature or a
Short Guide to Writing about Biology.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Working knowledge
of grammar and usage, excellent writing skills, ability
to work closely with people, and signature of faculty
member in writing or education. Class limit: 15. Meets
the following degree requirements: ED, W

HS 5014 Austen, Bronte, Eliot
WALDRON, KAREN
This is an advanced course which explores in depth
the works of three major writers of the Victorian
period: Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and George
Eliot. The set-up of the syllabus, group meetings,
and individual projects require that participants talk
about connective factors between texts and the
development of women writers’ voices and narrative
structures during this period. Emphasis will also be
placed on the construction of the heroine, the use and
manipulation of the marriage plot, developments in
124

linguistic and narrative practice, and developments
in each author’s work—from the juvenilia to the
later fiction. Historical perspectives, gender roles,
and theoretical approaches will all be taken into
consideration as we analyze novels such as: Lady
Susan, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion (Austen); The
Professor, Villette, and Shirley (Bronte); and The
Mill on the Floss and Middlemarch (Eliot). Rather
than prepare papers and exams, participants will
prepare and ask questions of each other, develop
response papers and passage analyses, and carry out
a sustained independent project to be presented to
the group. The outside project will involve additional
research into one of the major authors, to include
both the reading of another novel, biographical
information, and critical analyses. Projects will give
participants the opportunity to explore a particular
author, question, or form in depth. The reading load
for this tutorial is very heavy. Evaluation will focus on
preparation, participation, insight, critical thinking,
and the outside project, which will be be presented
orally and developed in an analytic fashion to be
determined by the class.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Permission of

HS 5015 Hydro Politics in a Thirsty World
CLINE, KEN
This course will look at the complex issues
surrounding the development, distribution, use, and
control of fresh water around the world. Focusing
primarily on developing countries, we will examine
three aspects of water use and control. First, we will
look at the scope and impact of water development
projects; second, we will examine the conflicts and
solutions related to transboundary river basins; and,
third, we will consider the implication of privatization
of water resources. By way of background, we will
review the variety of demands placed on fresh
water and the political institutions related to water
development. Students will gain a solid background
in international environmental law as it relates
to multilateral and bilateral treaties, customary
law, multilateral institutions, and the guidance of
international “soft law.” They will also understand
the allocation and equity issues surrounding the
privatization of water and the political dimensions of
this shift. Ultimately, these issues will give a concrete
understanding of some aspects of the concept of
sustainable development. Evaluation will be based
on class participation, short analytical papers, and a
substantial term-long assignment.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Solid background in
international politics, economics, human rights, or
development policy through coursework or personal
experience. Class limit: 20. Lab fee: $15. Meets the

automatic command of grammar and nuances
of idiomatic usages, broaden their vocabulary in
general and deepen it in targeted areas, enrich their
understanding of multiple dimensions of Hispanic
culture, and increase their ability to read, write,
hear, and speak in a variety of rhetorical forms
and genres. Student are evaluated based on class
participation, homework and their ability to work
effectively with multiple kinds of texts, interviews,
conversations, formal interviews, oral presentations,
writing exercises in different styles, and nonverbal
communication. Typically offered in fall or winter.

HS 5018 The Nature of Narrative
WALDRON, KAREN
This is an advanced, writing-focused course in which
students practice the human ecology of literary
analysis. We explore the “mind” or consciousness of
fictional writing (specifically, novels) by looking at
how narratives make meaning and at how we make
meaning from narratives. The course surveys some
of the best modern fiction, with a particular focus on
works that highlight narrative technique, stretch the
boundaries of the imagination, have a rich and deep
texture, and push against the inherent limitations
of textuality. Students also hone their reading and
analytic skills as they work closely with 20th century
texts that broke new literary ground. Some of the
authors we may read include: Joseph Conrad, Virginia
Woolf, William Faulkner, Monique Wittig, John Dos
Passos, Toni Morrison, N. Scott Momaday, Bessie
Head, Manuel Puig, and Margaret Atwood. We also
study some narrative (and possibly film) theory.
Evaluation is based on class participation, frequent
short response and passage analysis papers, and an
independent project.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisite: Signature of instructor.
Offered every other year. Class limit: 15. Meets the
following degree requirements: HS

HS 5020 Advanced International
Environmental Law Seminar
CLINE, KEN
This course is designed to provide an overview of
the use of international law in solving transnational
environmental problems and shaping international
behavior. We examine, as background, the nature and
limitations of international law as a force for change.
The course will then explore customary law, the
relationship between soft and hard law, enforcement

of international law, implementation mechanisms,
and the effectiveness of multilateral environmental
agreements. Special attention is given to existing
international environmental law frameworks
addressing climate change, Arctic and Antarctic
development, ozone depletion, biological diversity,
forest loss, export of toxic chemicals, and the host of
issues raised by the 1992 United Nations Conference
on the Environment and Development and subsequent
environmental fora. Students will also consider the
interface between international environmental law
and other important international forces such as the
Bretton Woods institutions, human rights frameworks,
and international development entities. Students
will be evaluated on the quality of their classroom
comments and several analytical problem sets
given during the term. Students will also be asked
to complete a major research project examining the
effectiveness of a treaty or a proposed international
environmental legal arrangement.

HS 5022 Hatchery
FRIEDLANDER, JAY
The Hatchery is applied human ecology in action; it
offers students a bridge from coursework to actively
creating their vision of the future. The Hatchery gives
students from across the campus the opportunity
to move from ideas to action. Hatchery students
work either individually or in teams on a wide
array of enterprises. Past projects have included:
urban farming; international development; policy
and planning; photography and film; alternative
transportation; biofuel production; renewable
energy; food systems; the arts; furniture production;
technology development; social enterprise. Ventures
have been for profit and nonprofit, encompassing
the range from local businesses to scalable startups.
Students selected for the Hatchery are required to
devote an entire term to launching their venture. Each
Hatchery enterprise, whether a team or an individual,
must take the course for a minimum of three credits.
Along with weekly instructional meetings, students
receive office space, supplies, professional services,
mentors, and potential access to seed capital to
develop their ventures. If students decide to continue
their enterprises after the initial 10 weeks of class,
they have access to the Hatchery space and resources
for an additional nine months.
The Hatchery takes place in three phases:
Application: Students apply for a position in the
Hatchery over winter term.
Rapid prototype: The 10 weeks of the Hatchery
course. Students create a rapid prototype to test their

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

ventures in the marketplace. These prototypes vary
widely depending on the type of ventures.

for students of all interests. Class sessions will be
organized as a weekly three-hour seminar and will
be predominantly discussion driven. Students will
be responsible for presenting certain works and will
also lead some of our discussions. Assignments will
emphasize critical, reflective, and analytical writing.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class
discussion, short written response papers, several
longer essays, individual presentations, and a final
recovery project.

Creating an enterprise structure: During the 10 weeks
of the course, students will have weekly assignments
that introduce key elements in an organizational
structure and highlight operational considerations
that are universal amongst enterprises.
Development: The following nine months. Students
have access to the Hatchery space and resources to
continue developing their enterprises.

HS 5044 Diaspora and Unbelonging

HS 5039 Equal Rights, Equal Voices: The
Rhetoric of Woman Suffrage

VAN VLIET, NETTA

MCKOWN, JAMIE
This seminar will provide an in-depth exploration of
public speech texts by a wide array of 19th century
woman suffrage activists in the United States. This
includes works by those individuals most often
associated with the first wave of the movement
including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
Sojourner Truth, Ernestine Rose, Lucy Stone, Anna
Dickinson, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Adelle Hazlett,
Victoria Woodhull, Anna Julia Cooper, and others.
There will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of
primary source materials as students encounter these
speakers in their own words. There are five main goals
of this seminar. First, to familiarize students with the
works of prominent suffrage and equal rights activists
from the period. Second, to help illuminate how the
ideas, choices, narratives, and arguments reflected
in these texts have some relation to contemporary
discourses of gender, power, and equality. Third,
to offer students the opportunity to conduct close
textual readings of significant texts in the field of
public address. This seminar is rooted in what might
be described as an experiential, grassroots approach
to rhetorical criticism, one that is unconstrained by
the needs of overly deterministic reading strategies.
We will focus more on building a “theory of the case”
from the ground up and through the eyes of the
seminar participants, rather than subjecting each case
to the demands of a predetermined comprehensive
model of rhetorical action. The fourth goal of the
class is to offer students the first hand opportunity to
conduct their own recovery projects with the aim of
locating, transcribing, documenting, and presenting
to the class new variations of texts from the period
that have been previously undocumented or left
unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn
basic techniques for exploring the types of digitized
historical collections that have emerged in only the
past few years. The final goal for the seminar is to
prompt an even broader series of questions about the
relationship between text, society, and the “public.”
These are questions that would obviously be salient
126

Etymologically, the word “diaspora” is traced to the
Greek dia meaning through, and speirein, meaning
to scatter or to sow. Historically, the term has been
associated with narratives of exile, displacement,
and migration, and with a sustained relation to what
is understood as an originary homeland. Although
Jewish diaspora is often the implicit or explicit
example through which diaspora is understood, the
term has been important for other cultural, ethnic,
and religious genealogies, as well as for recent efforts
to address political questions posed by contemporary
configurations of diasporic and displaced populations.
In this course, we will use questions about Jewish
difference as a point of departure for thinking about
questions of diaspora, belonging, and unbelonging
more generally. Diasporic relations raise questions
about what it means to belong to political community,
about borders between self and other and between
groups, about difference internal and external to the
polis, and about the concepts of home, homeland,
nation, and country. These questions in turn call
attention to the relation between different figures
and categories central to understandings of home
and abroad, stasis and mobility, such as citizen
and foreigner, refugee, asylum seeker. This course
examines different historical examples of conditions
and processes of diaspora by being attentive to
conditions and figures of unbelonging. In so doing, we
will consider contemporary problems of immigration,
displacement, and asylum. We will be particularly
attentive to questions about racialization, colonialism,
nationalism, gender, sexuality, and sexual difference.
The course is interdisciplinary, and we will draw
on work in postcolonial studies, political theory,
literature, anthropology, religion, and feminist theory.
Students will be evaluated based on attendance, inclass participation, reading responses, and two short
analytical essays.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Ideally, students
should have taken at least three courses in
human studies and/or arts and design, or have
other background in thinking about politics and

HS 5049 Social Science Research Methods
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
This course introduces students to the process of
designing social science research, focusing specifically
on developing research questions, selecting suitable
methods, and designing the research plan. The
social sciences have a long history of debate over
the value of qualitative versus quantitative research;
operating from the position that research questions
should drive methods selection, this course covers
a range of qualitative and quantitative approaches.
Topics covered include: the link between theory and
the development of research objectives, questions,
variables, measures, and hypotheses; research design
and threats to validity; systematic data collection
procedures including surveys, semi-structured and
structured interviews, participant observation, and
cognitive methods; mixed-methods and exploratory
versus explanatory approaches; probability and nonprobability sampling; data management; numerical,
text, and narrative data analysis; and proposal design.
Students are evaluated based on class participation,
fieldwork and field notes, and a final research
proposal that integrates and applies the methods
and concepts covered in the course. This course is of
particular value for third- and fourth-year students
preparing for their senior projects.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Permission of
instructor and at least two social science courses
such as anthropology, economics, media studies,
political science, psychology, or related fields. Class
limit: 12. Lab fee: $40. Meets the following degree
requirements: HS

HS 5051 Capitalism: Economics and
Institutions
TAYLOR, DAVIS
Capitalism is the dominant form of economic
institutional arrangements and production in the
world today, along with a set of culturally inflected
values and an interpretive frame for understanding
the world around us that is a crucial context for work
in human ecology. The focus of this course is on the
economic imperatives of capitalism, the resulting
institutional arrangements, and the socioeconomic
outcomes that capitalism produces; we will also
dedicate some time to the (other) cultural dimensions
of capitalism, largely through the incorporation of
guest lecturers in the latter part of the term. The
foundational economic analysis will use both Marxist
and what can be called “critical macroeconomic”
theories to understand the economic processes

and results of capitalism. Our focus will be on
contemporary capitalism, but we will briefly examine
the historical development of capitalism as a means
of understanding contemporary patterns. A major
impetus for the course is Thomas Piketty’s Capitalism
in the 21st Century, and its focus on inequality will
be a major focus of the course. Other prominent
themes will be pre-capitalist modes of production,
the labor theory of value, markets and processes of
labor commodification and alienation, the formal and
informal institutions of capitalism, money and other
forms of debt, international capitalistic relations,
crises, and variations of contemporary capitalism.
Learning will be accomplished via the reading, study,
analysis, and discussion of classic and contemporary
theories of capitalism, and applications to current
local, national, and international situations and events.
Evaluation will be based on four major problem
sets (consisting of short essay responses), a final
poster presentation, and participation in classroom
discussions and other fora.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: One course in
intermediate economics and one additional
intermediate course that closely relates to the study
of capitalism (e.g. another economics course, critical
theory, etc.), and permission of instructor. Class

HS 5060 Food and War Part II
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
In this course, we will draw on the fields of food
studies, history, anthropology, international studies,
and political science to understand how war has
shaped and been shaped by past and contemporary
food systems. Food & War Part II focuses on case
studies of historical and contemporary wars. We
will select case studies based on the interest of
those in the class but examples might include foodbased conflict strategies used by and against First
Nations and Native American groups, and civil and
international conflicts involving Vietnam, Ethiopia,
the Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, and the United States. As
a reading and discussion based course, we will
primarily examine our topic through books, peerreviewed articles, and news articles as we consider
the questions: How has food been used as both a
weapon of war and a tool of diplomacy? How has
conflict transformed the ways people grow, harvest,
and eat food? And how have cuisines spread and
evolved in relationship to war? Students will be
evaluated based on preparation for and participation
in class discussions, a series of synthesis papers, and
a research project on a conflict of their choice. Food
& War Part II compliments Part I but students are not
required to have taken the first course.
Level: Advances. Prerequisites: Students must have

HS 5062 Corn and Coffee
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD
This course explores the rich history of capitalism
through the lens of two of the most ubiquitous
and valuable crops in the world: corn and coffee.
The crops provide insight into the global and local
dimensions of both historical and contemporary
reality in the countries where they are grown with a
focus on Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States.
Corn and coffee provide a convenient vantage point
from which to examine the social, economic, and
cultural dynamics of community-based production
of both crops on the one hand and their globallyconnected production as commodities. The course
moves from a broad macro perspective on each
crop to an intensive exploration of how both are
produced in Guatemala. In this way, class participants
will be able to look at how global historical trends
in consumption have played themselves out in local
communities. The class will simultaneously be able to
look at the processes at work in pueblos throughout
Guatemala that root the corn economy into rich
cultural and social dynamics that are at the core of
communal life. Using these two crops as a starting
point, the class will allow students to develop a
holistic and synthetic understanding of how global
food systems land in places. The course emphasizes
attention to the broad global dimensions of corn and
coffee’s production as well as the fine-grained study
of Guatemala’s socio-cultural life in historical and
anthropological perspective. Through discussions
of the books, this seminar-style course seeks to
provide students with deep insights into the history
of a specific place while maintaining a sense of the
global and regional context. Intensive readings will
provide students with a snapshot of trends in both
history and ethnography while broader synthetic
analyses of both corn and coffee will embody more
popular approaches to the topic. Students will lead
discussions of the readings, write short synthetic
essays, and undertake a research project for the
class. Evaluation will be based on short writing,
course participation, and the final project.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Signature of the
instructor, any of the following courses: Native
Empires to Nation States; Articulated Identities;

HS 6012 Learning a Language on Your Own
COX, GRAY
The goal of this course to help each student design
and implement an effective learning program for
the study of a language of their choice at whatever
level of learning they are currently at. A very
wide variety of general strategies, resources, and
practical advice for independent language learning
are reviewed in weekly class sessions along with
progress and reflection reports from each student
that can help guide and motivate independent work.
The core common text for this work will be Betty Lou
Leaver, Madeline Ehrman and Boris Shekhtman’s
Achieving Success in Second Language Acquisition.
The primary focus of the class is on the development
and implementation of each student’s individually
designed plan for learning a language of their choice.
Materials for this will be identified by each student as
part of their work on their chosen language. Progress
in these plans are discussed in one on one weekly
meetings with the teacher. Plans may include the
use of software, peer tutors, Skype, videos, standard
texts, flash cards, specialized technical material,
music, visual art, field trips, and a wide variety of
other materials as appropriate. Evaluation will be
based on the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness
of the student’s developed plan, and the discipline
with which they actually pursue it and revise it
appropriately as the term progresses. Students will
be asked to meet with the instructor prior to the start
of the term to discuss their motivation, aims, possible
resources and possible plans for language learning
after the course is over.

MD 1015 Farm Animal Management
COLLUM, KOURTNEY
This course will provide an introduction to the basics
of farm animal care and management with a focus
on small-scale, sustainable livestock production. The
course will include readings on topics ranging from
traditional production agriculture to contemporary
sustainable livestock farming, guest lectures from
professionals within the local agricultural community
(e.g., experienced farmers, extension agents, and
veterinarians), student-led discussions of assigned
readings, and hands-on participatory learning through
visits to working farms in our area. Students will
explore the various health and nutrition needs of
common livestock, including monogastrics (hogs),
avian (poultry), ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), and
pseudo-ruminants (horses). The course will have a
strong focus on the integration of two or more of
these livestock species on a diversified farm and will
cover pasture management and feed production.
Students will be evaluated based on attendance,
participation in class discussion and activities, short
synthesis essays, and a final project focused on the
integration of livestock into a farm setting.
Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: Permission of
instructor. Class limit: 10. Lab fee: $25

MD 1022 Working the Sea
ANDERSON, JOHN
For much of the past 5,000 years the sea has played
a major role in a broad variety of human cultures,
histories, arts, and economies. Seafaring peoples have
developed a rich lore and technology that allows them
to both survive and even thrive in an often hostile
element. This course will mix practical, hands-on
learning of aspects of seamanship with a survey of
fiction and nonfiction that address maritime themes.
During the early part of the term we will concentrate
on aspects of small-boat handling, using the College’s
inflatables, rowing boats, and the larger research
vessels, Osprey and Laughing Gull. Students will learn
how to launch and land small craft from docks and
beaches, basic rowing skills, and use of an outboard
motor. They will learn essential knots useful aboard
ship and on the dock, how to lay out a course using a
chart and compass, use of GPS and depth sounders,
basic rules of the road, and elements of celestial
navigation. During some lab periods we will go on
short voyages in the general area of Frenchman Bay.
As the term proceeds and weather worsens, we will
turn to an increasingly greater literary component,
reading accounts of famous voyages and local
fishermen, discoveries, battles, legends, and poetry.
Possible texts include, but are not limited to: Working
the Sea by Wendell Seavey, Master and Commander

by Patrick O’ Brian, Maiden Voyage by Tania Aebi,
The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, In the Heart
of The Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, Longitude by Dava
Sobel, Slave Ship: A Human History by Marcus Rediker,
Kon Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl, We Didn’t Mean to Go To
Sea by Arthur Ransome, as well as excerpts from The
Greenlanders’ Saga, Moby Dick, The Old Man and the
Sea, The Voyage of the Beagle, and Two Years Before
the Mast. Students will be evaluated on the basis of
class participation, a number of short quizzes—which
will include practical elements—and a term paper
focusing on one aspect of working the sea.
Level: Introductory. Prerequisites: Permission of
instructor. Class limit: Seven. Lab Fee $100

MD 1025 Science Visualization: Theory and
Practice
ROCK, JENNIFER
This course provides an introduction to how
science has been, and can be, visualized. It is a
multidisciplinary course in being informed by the
history and philosophy of science, neuroscience,
and different theories associated with cognition,
pedagogy, communication, design and art, as well
as ideas about the democratization of science and
science communication through both actor-network
theory/controversy mapping and co-creation/
participatory practice. Throughout, we will combine
theory with critical and creative practice. Students will
engage with the primary literature as well as online
multimedia. Students will have hands-on exercises
with specific approaches like infographics and data
visualization, as well as tackle transmedia approaches
for constructing distributed science narratives. The
final project work will investigate ways to graphically
represent the complexity of interactions within an
issue of science in society.
Evaluations will be based on three components: a
series of practical visualization exercises (collectively
worth 40% of final grade); reflective engagement with
assigned readings and multimedia material (35%);
and an individual transmedia project that maps the
components and interactions of a contemporary
science in society issue (25%). This course will be of
interest to a diversity of students, including those
interested in communicating science to the public,
those interested in issues of science in society, and
those interested in visual design and sci-art.

Century

shared culture, defines and develops community,
and sometimes is an act of subversive and overt
revolution. This course is a sampler of the ways
sewing, in home and industry, is gendered and drives
economies. Throughout this course, we will investigate
topics like the Triangle Shirt Fire, subsequent labor
regulations, the mending movement, fast fashion,
environmental impact, and sewing as a means of
provocation and ritual. Artists such as Sonya Clark,
Nick Cave, Ruth Asawa, Bisa Butler, Do Ho Suh,
Sheila Hicks, and projects like Social Justice Sewing
Academy will be topics of discussion. Students will
make weekly individual stitched projects, and design
and contribute to a collective project. Depending on
the term, the course may also include off-campus
field trips and guest appearances from visiting
artists. This class is introductory and open to all
students irrespective of their background in sewing,
needlework, or related topics. All coursework can
be done with simple needle and thread. Evaluation
will be based on short response papers to readings/
presentations, stitched projects, a presentation
on individual research (the form of this is open),
participation in class discussions, and a final project.

JENEI, NICHOLAS PAUL
Primitive skills are the knowledge, practices, and
simple tools unique to a specific bioregion that
allowed the ancestors of modern humans to thrive
in every corner of the earth without agriculture or
industry. Knowledge of these primitive, or primary,
skills have been passed down and honed through
countless generations, and are still practiced today
as a way of connecting with our deep past, the
natural world, and a simpler, more intentional way of
life. Through this course you will learn Maine-based
primitive skills at COA Peggy Rockefeller Farms bush
camp, explore primitive skills as a global movement
and delve into its philosophical foundations, and track
the nature of your evolving relationship with, well,
nature. Together we will learn a suite of essential
bushcraft skills that are part of a millennia-old living
tradition of how to travel through and thrive in
Maine’s ecoregions and seasons. Some of the core
survival skills covered include fire making, shelter
building, foraging/hydration, and axe and knife
work. But learning how to thrive in the Maine woods
requires a very diverse set of knowledge and you
will be introduced to practical botany, cordage and
knots, canoeing, animal tracking, traditional craft,
navigation, mental preparedness, medicinal plants,
first aid, and more. We will explore these topics
through readings, videos, and practicum experiences.
The driving question of our inquiry is to explore, and
experience, the value that primitive skills bring to
contemporary life. This class will have one 1.5-hour
classroom session and one three-hour field session
per week. Additionally there will be two weekend
field trips (dates to be determined by the class).
Student evaluation will be based on practicum skill
assessments, self-reflection through journaling, and
an individual research project. This class is open to all
students regardless of their previous background or
experience with primitive or outdoor skills. However,
students will be expected to engage in moderately
strenuous physical activity, including hikes up to
4 miles, chopping and carrying wood, and building
structures out of small trees weighing up to 50lbs.
Anyone with an interest in primitive skills, outdoor
survival, place-based education, or experiential
learning would benefit from the class.

MOSER, NIKKI

This course will cover fermentation from raw
material to final commercial production, sales, and
marketing. Drawing on the instructor’s experience as
a microbrewing entrepreneur, the class will introduce
students to all aspects of the art of fermentation/
brewing from sourcing ingredients and microbiology
to biochemistry and sensory evaluation. This content
will be blended with aspects of the business end of
producing beer and wines. Students will also learn
about branding, value-added production, and running
a small local fermentation business. The class will
include classroom lecture-based instruction, handson elements, as well as work sessions and field trips
to Fogtown Brewing in Ellsworth. Students will be
evaluated on their preparation for class, mini-projects,
and an independent final project. Students should
plan on making themselves available for classes and
work sessions outside of normal class times. Classes
such as the Art and Science of Fermentation, The
Cider Project, or The Chemistry of Food could be
helpful, but the course is intended for a broad range of
students with diverse interests who are willing to dig
into the course content.

MD 1030 Zoological Field Sketching
GRAHAM, CARRIE
This multidisciplinary course will encourage students
to develop a regular sketchbook practice using
animals as the focus of study. It is intended for any
student who wishes to improve their sketching and
observational skills, gain an understanding of animal
anatomy, and learn about local animal life. Students
will draw from museum specimens, taxidermy
mounts, and live animals using a variety of media and
techniques suitable for field sketching. Class will take
place in the Dorr Museum and at field sites within
Acadia National Park. We will also visit live animals
at locations that may include the COA farms, Acadia
Wildlife, Birdsacre, and the COA islands. The ability to
make careful observations and record them through
sketches is an invaluable tool for artists, scientists,
and other curious and creative people. Maintaining a
sketchbook can be both a professionally useful and
personally rewarding practice.
This course will meet for two three-hour sessions per
week. The first session will include a lesson about
a particular animal taxon, followed by sketching
exercises using museum specimens and mounts as
references. In the second session, students will draw
from live animals in the field. Students will also spend
approximately nine hours per week outside of class on
additional field sketching assignments, readings, and
research.
Evaluations will emphasize participation and student
growth rather than artistic ability. Our focus will
be on practice and learning to effectively record
observations, not on creating polished illustrations.
Prior experience with drawing is not required.

MD 2011 Fisheries, Fishermen, and Fishing
Communities
PETERSEN, CHRISTOPHER
Downeast Maine, from the Penobscot River east to the
Canadian border, includes Hancock and Washington
counties, a region of extremes between high levels of
tourism, like Mount Desert Island, and many coastal
towns that are heavily reliant on fisheries for their
economic existence. This long history of cultural
and economic dependence on fisheries makes the
region particularly vulnerable to fisheries decline,
such as the collapse of the sardine and cod fisheries.
Recent trends in the lobster, clam, scallop, and elver
fisheries, as well as aquaculture, show various levels
of instability and risk. At the same time, numerous
initiatives in the region focus on revitalizing and
stabilizing fisheries, while enhancing community
resilience. This class uses a variety of interdisciplinary approaches to examine the relationships
among marine resources, fisheries policy, harvesters,

and communities. We are interested in examining
the relationships within this linked social-ecological
system, and use historical data, current documents,
interviews and oral histories to examine the humanecological relationships among residents, policy,
and resources. We also will examine new economic
initiatives in these communities, including ecotourism,
aquaculture, and renewable energy. We have several
individuals coming to campus to discuss issues
with the class, and we will take several field trips
(including an overnight to the Cobscook Bay area) to
Downeast communities. Evaluation will be based on
several assignments during the term, including an
oral history, sets of essay questions, and research
on a fishery. Students will also work on a small group
project examining a research question using multiple
methodologies, with a presentation and paper due
at the end of the term. Active engagement during
class, with guest speakers, and on field trips will be
expected.

class in anthropology, marine biology, fisheries, or
environmental policy, and permission of instructor.
Class limit: 15. Lab fee: $100

MD 2012 Failure
BAKER, JODI
Failure looms large in society. Is it a badge of honor, an
inextricable part of a process, a means to success, or
rather something to be feared and ashamed of? In this
course, students will explore how notions of failure
align and contrast between gender, class, and culture.
We will also explore if conceptions of failure differ
substantially among the artistic, business, and other
communities. In divergence with historical attitudes,
today’s entrepreneurs are implored to “fail cheap and
fail fast,” and events, like FailCon, celebrate failure
as a badge of honor. In art failure is simply inherent
to process. And yet, the fear and sting of failure is
real for everyone. Through a series of practicums,
readings, guest lectures, and discussions this class
will explore various aspects of failure. Students will be
evaluated on class participation, a series of solo and
group projects, selections from a failure journal, and
contributions to a shared class blog.
Level: Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: None.

images of the natural world don’t just happen; they
are made by individuals skilled in both photography
and the life sciences. In this course, students will
develop technical, observational, and aesthetic skills

to extract relevant information from the natural
world and organisms collected from nature. Through
acquired skills, students will be expected to conceive
methods to document the biological world and
communicate concepts using strong visual imagery.
Photographic techniques and historical examples will
be learned and applied. Students will be evaluated
based on their successful completion of a series of
project-based assignments, participation in critiques,
and their ability to effectively convey biological
principles through photography.

MD 3012 The Anthropocene
HALL, SARAH; VAN VLIET, NETTA
This course considers the definition of the human in
terms of the politics of climate change and discussions
about the notion of the Anthropocene by staging an
encounter between the discipline of geology and work
in the humanities. Suggestions by scientists over the
last few decades that human activity on the planet
has attained geological force led Nobel Laureate
Paul Crutzen to argue in 2000 that the current
epoch should be called the “Anthropocene.” Others
challenge this suggestion, pointing out that humans
have long left traces on the earth. Discussions about
the Anthropocene are tied to the challenge of how
to respond to the effects of human-induced climate
change, including the threat of human extinction.
This course will address questions such as: How do
scientists and humanists engage with policy and
scholarship about climate change? What are their
central questions and key terms? We will consider
how understandings of geological time and the stories
rocks tell might inform thinking in the humanities
about climate change. In turn, we will consider how
humanist questions about the definition of the human
might inform the ways in which science interfaces with
politics and policy regarding climate change.
This course is co-taught by a geologist and an
anthropologist, and will be an exercise in translation
between very different fields. Class material will
include laboratory activities, seminar discussions,
and close readings of texts in postcolonial studies,
geology, anthropology, and literature. Students will
be assessed based on class participation, reading
responses, laboratory activities, and a final project.
Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: None, but
preference will be given to those who have had prior
course work in either anthropology or geology.
Permission of instructor required. Class limit: 16. Lab

Sheep play profoundly important roles in human
societies. This course is a human-ecological
exploration of sheep and wool, combined with a
hands-on component in which we will work with sheep
and learn fiber arts. This class will meet for one
studio session and two lecture/discussion sections
per week, plus at least one Saturday field trip. In
the studio sessions, we will study sheep husbandry
through visits to Peggy Rockefeller Farms and learn
a variety of techniques for working with wool, from
the preparation (shearing, washing, and carding) to
spinning and working with yarn (including knitting,
crochet, and weaving). The lecture/discussion
sessions will cover topics such as the ecological
impacts of sheep in different parts of the world, the
physics of spinning and the chemistry of dyes, and
the symbolism of sheep in the mythology of different
cultures. The course will draw on a wide range of
material and intellectual approaches, with sheep and
wool as the unifying theme. Students will be evaluated
based on participation, short written assignments,
and a final oral presentation.
No prior knowledge of fiber craft is necessary,
but students who come in knowing one of the
basic techniques may be able to explore advanced
techniques like lacework or design in three
dimensions. Students should meet with the instructor
before spring break to discuss goals and equipment
needs for the studio sessions. Some basic supplies
will be provided, but students should plan to purchase
additional equipment such as knitting needles
depending on the projects that they choose.

MD 3014 Museum Practicum
COLBERT, DRU
This course offers students the opportunity to
participate in the authorship, design, and fabrication
of interpretive projects in COA George B. Dorr
Museum of Natural History. Typically coursework
surrounds the creation of educational environments,
activities, and events that showcase concepts and
content on changing special topics. Areas of content
explored in projects range between art, science,
and natural history. With guidance, students in the
tutorial will engage in researching content, developing
interpretive projects, writing textual elements, and
designing and fabricating installations, events, and
activities in the museum. The class will act as a team
and collaborate to develop and produce material.
Evaluation will be based on (dependent on specific
tasks that include research, writing, and fabrication):
attention to detail, quality of craft, effective
collaboration in an iterative group process, and the

COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC COURSE CATALOG 2022–2023

timely completion of work. The success of this group
project is dependent upon a high level of scholarship
and crafting of exhibit areas toward an end-ofterm completion date for the realization of project
elements. This course is appropriate for students
interested in education, design, and communication.
Level: Intermediate. Prerequisite: Permission

MD 3015 Green Building through the Lens
of LEED
GIBSON, DAVID
Every day, we live, work, study, eat, play, relax, and
sleep in buildings. Americans spend ~87% of our time
inside buildings. What makes a building sustainable?
This course will be an exploration of green building
concepts, materials, and best practices. We will use
the US Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED) certification process
as a framework for understanding buildings, including
their materials, energy use, water consumption, site
location, occupant health, and interconnection with
the surrounding community. LEED is the most widely
used green building certification in the world, with
more than 110,000 certified projects representing 24
billion square feet of building space.
This course will include field trips to local building
projects and/or building material producers,
presentation(s) from architects or design
professionals, reading core LEED materials,
independent research, and group projects. Students
will apply their knowledge to building projects on
or off campus. Students will be evaluated based
on participation in class, completion of homework
assignments, and group projects/presentations.
Students who complete this course will be prepared
for the LEED Green Associate exam and certification
($100 cost to complete certification). This course
is designed for students interested in construction,
design, sustainability, community planning, climate
resiliency, and touches on an array of other subject
areas.
Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Physics & Math of
Sustainable Energy or permission of instructor. Class
limit: 12. Lab fee: $50

MD 3016 Origins: History, Genetics, and
Memory
LITTLE-SIEBOLD, TODD; HESS, HELEN
Families are a touchstone of many people’s identities,
and stories about where we come from and who
came before us are often key ways of orienting
ourselves and understanding who we are. Storytelling,
documentary and photographic collections, and

other methods of preserving memories serve as the
very concrete ways that many of us come to learn
about our immediate family and our ancestors. New
techniques of genetic testing provide a method that
can contribute to that understanding and in some
cases fill in blanks left about ancestors and provide
a new source of stories in addition to those passed
along from generation to generation. Recreational
DNA testing can also provoke discussion about how
to make sense of the genetic stories revealed and
how they mesh with or challenge people’s sense of
themselves. This class will explore the traditional
methods of collecting family histories (oral history,
genealogical research) and recreational genetic
testing as a point of entry into complex issues around
history, memory, ethics, race, and the role of new
technologies. Students will learn the basic skills of
doing genealogical research as well as develop an
understanding of the strengths and limitations of
human genetic testing, which can reveal our shared
history as well as our differences. Evaluation will be
based on class participation, short assignments, and
a final project. The expectations surrounding the
final project explain why this course is designated
as intermediate even though there are no specific
prerequisites. Students will be expected to
conceptualize, plan, and carry out their own projects,
and they will be evaluated on their ability to selfdirect, seek feedback, and complete those projects.
This class is appropriate for a wide range of students
with diverse interests concerning identity and history.
Level: Intermediate. Prerequisite: None. Class limit: 15.

MD 4013 Demons from the Depths
ANDERSON, JOHN
Across a range of epochs, cultures, and territories,
human beings have proffered myths, stories, and
scientific theories in order to explain catastrophic
natural events. From kata=down, strephein=turn,
the Greek katastrephein meant “under-turning” in
the ancient world. This course explores postulations
regarding large- and small-scale calamitous events
that seem to originate from below the surface of
Earth. Our enquiry engages with legendary tales,
historical records, material culture, and scientific
discourses that document attempts to explain the
meaning and/or mechanism of such memorable
episodes. What causes a mountain to eject ash and
toxic gases? What infernal force creates lava flow?
Why does the earth shake? Why do some natural
waters cause harm? How do we understand that which
we cannot see? Through case studies informed by the
literature of science, the arts, and humanities, we will
plumb the depths and limits of the human imagination.
This class uses both a lecture-based and seminar-style
discussion approach as well as time spent visiting local
lab and field sites. Students will be evaluated based on
their weekly activities and writing assignments, and a

MD 4014 Building Science and Energy
Auditing
GIBSON, DAVID
Buildings account for nearly 40% of global carbon
emissions. Sixty percent of Maine homes are heated
with heating oil, the highest percentage of any state,
and Mainers spend more than a billion dollars on
heating oil each year. Improving the efficiency of our
homes and buildings is essential for transitioning away
from fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions.
In this course, students will learn how to safely
transition buildings away from fossil fuels. This
includes understanding the science of energy
and moisture movement through a building, how
to monitor carbon monoxide and other harmful
combustion gases, and methods to reduce energy loss
while maintaining comfortable levels of humidity and
fresh air. Students will gain proficiency measuring air
leakage with a blower door, using an infrared camera
to assess insulation levels, calculating heat loss, and
identifying solutions and best practices to develop a
plan of action for homeowners.
They will also learn about high efficiency mechanical
systems like air source heat pumps, heat pump water
heaters, and how to assess lighting and appliance
electrical usage. Students will learn how to carry out
cost calculations for energy savings and research and
share information on rebates and incentives available
for homeowners. This will be a very hands-on course,
with weekly labs to teach energy auditing field skills.
This course will include presentations from local
energy contractors, and students will participate
in energy audits of residential buildings on or off
campus. Through these experiences, students will
meet and interact with home performance businesses
and nonprofit organizations in the local community.
As time and weather conditions permit, students will
gain experience implementing efficiency solutions
such as insulation and air sealing.
Students who successfully complete this course
will be able to conduct energy audits for homes,
identify cost-effective improvements, and prioritize
energy improvements to maximize energy savings.
This course will provide students with the tools
and experience to reduce building energy use and
greenhouse gas emissions in a holistic, whole-building
approach. Evaluation will be based on completion of
assignments, participation in class discussions, and
mastery of field skills.

Drawing on performance studies, movement training,
postcolonial studies, and feminist theory, this class
will investigate understandings of what is made
to count as “political” in relation to claims about
representation and the body. Over the course of
the term, we will investigate and produce a range of
conditions through which we consider ideas about
responsibility, decision, the unknown and unexpected,
repetition and difference, translation and dialogue,
and relations of individual to group. We will do so
through learning about the ways in which bodies
matter in the fields of theatre, anthropology, and
literature. Both anthropology and theatre are often
presumed to be vehicles for representation and for
political change, but they have also posed questions
about how the body challenges assumptions about
representation and politics. This course will grapple
with assumptions that politics is primarily about
representation, speaking in “one’s own name,” or
in the name of others. We will take questions about
representation and its limits as a point of departure to
consider the significance of the body (and bodies) for
understandings of politics. We will focus on questions
of affect, the sensory, proximity, temporality, scale,
and place. In so doing, we will consider the idea of
politics as based on a relation and response to an
other, rather than on representation. In turn, we will
address questions about the relationship between art
and politics. Classes will include movement training
practices and seminar discussion. Course materials
may include works by Hannah Arendt, Anne Bogart,
Charlie Chaplin, Charles Darwin, Jacques Derrida,
Sarah DeLappe, Cornelius Eady, Shoshana Felman,
Sigmund Freud, Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins, Valeria
Luiselli, Jean-Luc Nancy, William Shakespeare,
Sophocles, Tadashi Suzuki, and Anna Tsing. Students
will be evaluated based on class participation,
collaborative group projects, seminar discussion,
short topic responses, and a final project.
Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: permission of
instructor; priority will be given to students who
have successfully completed advanced coursework in
literature, anthropology or performance atudies. Class
limit: 12. Lab fee: $50
