Puritans and the first examples of that long-lived American genre, the captivity narrative. This colonial period culminated in the
eighteenth century's American Enlightenment, which gave rise to the Revolution, and was soon followed by the first stirrings of
literary nationalism in the early republic. Encompassing three hundred years of history and an international range of authors, this

GEO 265 - The Power of Maps
Humans have been making maps for thousands of years, but never before were maps as present in everyday life as they are
today. Just think of the GPS in cars and the locator apps on our phones. It is more important than ever that we understand maps,
how they are made, and how they have shaped society, from guiding imperial expansion to influencing urban development, land
use, tourism, and surveillance. This course teaches students the history of maps and map-making from the first rock carvings of
ancient cities to Google Earth and smart bombs. Major topics will include how maps have been essential tools for government,
warfare, territorial control, social and economic planning, and artistic expression. We will explore how map-making technology
has changed over time, the drive for increasing accuracy, and how the design of maps reflects the cultures that produce them.
Students will also learn how to make their own maps to tell a spatial historical narrative. Most broadly, this course will teach
students how to read maps as rich documents that are fascinating windows on the past. If this course was taken under as a topics

HTY 222 - Maine Indian History in the Twentieth Century
Too often Native people are relegated to the distant past, leading society to have misunderstandings about indigenous
communities today. This course introduces students Wabanaki history of Maine and eastern Canada in the twentieth century. The
term "Wabanaki" is an all-inclusive term that refers primarily to Mi'kmaqs, Maliseets, Passamaquoddies, and Penobscots, along
with other Abenaki groups. The tribal homeland encompasses present-day northern New England, the Maritime Provinces, and
southern Quebec. We will explore the variety of ways Wabanaki experiences deviated from the national narrative on American
Indians and examine when Native challenges were in lockstep with western tribes in the twentieth century. This course considers
the interplay between cultural traditions and modernity. The regional scope highlights local developments. We will investigate
prominent themes of resistance, accommodation, activism, sovereignty, and cultural survival. Wabanaki people were positive
actors in their own affairs, not passive pawns subdued by forces beyond their control. This course will provide context to
contemporary challenges Wabanaki people confront. As one tribal historian astutely noted, "I can never give up hope, as my
ancestors never gave up hope."

HTY 251 - Technology and Society from Ancient Times till the Present
A survey of the history of Western technology and, to a lesser extent, non-Western technology from ancient times till the
present. The course covers major developments both 'internally" -- as tools and machines" -- and "externally" as related to the
societies which have produced them and upon they in turn have had impact. Thus HTY 251 is not an old-fashioned and one-sided
"nuts and bolts" course. Instead HTY 251 examines the complex relationship between (1) technological change and (2) social,
cultural, economic, and political change as each has affected the other over. Old-fashioned "nuts and bolts" history of technology
courses invariably assume that virtually all technological developments constitute "progress" and often make technological
"progress" the measure of all things. By contrast, HTY 251 repeatedly asks if that traditional simplistic equation between
technological advances and social, cultural, economic, and political advances is accurate or if it might be rethought in various
instances over the course of history.

emphasis will be placed on exploring New England and Eastern Canada as a transnational region in the making, where there have
been more historical similarities than differences in spite of the gradual hardening of borders between countries, states, and
provinces. The course will follow a rough chronology, and cover topics such as building borders, political institutions, and
identities, economic pursuits like agriculture, forestry, and fishing, sporting cultures, women's suffrage, civil rights,
environmental movements, and indigenous resurgences.

use, tourism, and surveillance. This course teaches students the history of maps and map-making from the first rock carvings of
ancient cities to Google Earth and smart bombs. Major topics will include how maps have been essential tools for government,
warfare, territorial control, social and economic planning, and artistic expression. We will explore how map-making technology
has changed over time, the drive for increasing accuracy, and how the design of maps reflects the cultures that produce them.
Students will also learn how to make their own maps to tell a spatial historical narrative. Most broadly, this course will teach
students how to read maps as rich documents that are fascinating windows on the past. If this course was taken under as a topics
course in HTY 398, it cannot be repeated for credit.

WLE 457 - Ecology and Management of Game Birds
This course provides a broad survey of topics relevant to the ecology and management of the ducks, geese, grouse, quail, and
woodcock that are native to North America - species we typically consider "Game Birds" because of their popularity for human
harvest. We'll place particular emphasis on species that regularly occur in Maine. In doing so we will cover a number of areas
related to avian biology in general, including taxonomy, physiology, behavior, and species' conservation, and will synthesize
across subjects that are relevant to wildlife ecology as a whole. The course content will include a mix of lectures, class
discussions, group and independent projects, and field trips. This class is designed to meet the University requirement as a
writing intensive general elective, and will means that you will required to complete a major written project as a component of
the course and will receive feedback on your writing and have the opportunity to revise your work. One weekend field trip will
be required.

Enrollment Status
Full-time Status
Full-time undergraduate students can be registered for sufficient credits each semester to complete their academic programs in
four years (eight regular semesters). For most programs, this means students must average 15 credits per semester to earn the
minimum of 120 credits required for graduation. Some programs require more than 120 credits.
The University treats undergraduate students registered for 12 or more credits as full-time students for purposes of calculating
student financial aid, determining eligibility for campus housing, athletic eligibility, veteran's benefits, student fees, and for all
other activities which vary according to enrollment status. Failure to register for at least 12 credits per semester will jeopardize
eligibility in the above mentioned areas. Classes taken with an Audit status (no grade or credit hours earned) are not counted
when determining enrollment status. Students who will be less than full time and are receiving financial aid should report a
"change in enrollment plans" when accepting their financial aid through MaineStreet's Student Self-Service. The Office of
Student Financial Aid will receive this information and if required will update the financial aid award. If the award is adjusted the
student will receive an email notification.
For the spring semester students are encouraged to update the enrollment status in November. Failure to report a change in
enrollment plans may result in a delay in receiving an expected refund when financial aid is disbursed.
The University grants exceptions to the full-time status under the following conditions (these exceptions do not apply to financial
aid):

•

Students who formally register in courses in select Cooperative Education, Field Experience, or Internships as part of
their UMaine programs.

• Graduating seniors who need less than 12 credits to complete requirements and have applied to graduate.
Reduced Course Load Policy:
It is the policy and practice of the University of Maine to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section
4504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These laws direct the institution to provide academic adjustments to accommodate
students with disabilities. To this end, the University has established a Reduced Course Load Policy for students with disabilities.
The University defines full-time student status as twelve credit hours per semester for undergraduates and six for graduate
students. On the recommendation of the Office of Student Accessibility Services and an Advisory Committee, and with the
approval of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost or designee, undergraduate students requesting
reasonable accommodation for a documented disability who register for no fewer than six hours enjoy the rights and privileges of
full-time students. Appropriate reduced hours for graduate students are determined on a case-by-case basis. Students granted
reduced course load status are assessed mandatory fees in accordance with University policy. In some cases, receipt of benefits is
contingent on payment of fees.
The policy does not extend to student eligibility for such programs as federal financial aid, U.S. Veterans Administration
benefits, academic scholarships, and health insurance. Students approved for a reduced course load are responsible for
determining the impact of that load on their eligibility for federal financial aid, VA benefits (including housing allowance),
scholarships, and/or insurance. The University is not responsible for the reduction or loss of non-University aid, privileges, gifts,
remuneration, or other real or perceived benefits resulting from a student's decision to carry a reduced course load.
Students requesting this accommodation must provide current comprehensive evidence of a documented disability from a health
care professional and an official transcript from any institution(s) they attended prior to enrolling at the University of Maine.
The Office of Student Accessibility Services organizes and oversees all procedures relating to the enactment of this policy and
provides a written annual report to the Provost. For further information, contact Student Accessibility Services via phone at
207.581.2319 or visit our website at www.umaine.edu/studentaccessibility.
