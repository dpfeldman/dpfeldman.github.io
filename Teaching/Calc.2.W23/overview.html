<blockquote>
    Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
    more fun to teach than the calculus. It is like being the
    ringmaster of a great three-ring circus. It has been said that one
    can recognize the students on a college campus who have studied
    the calculus -- they are the students with no eyebrows. In utter
    astonishment at the incredible applicability of the subject, the
    eyebrows of the calculus students have receded higher and higher
    and finally vanished over the backs of their heads.

      the big ideas of calculus: the integral. </li>
    <li>Gain a good introduction to infinite sum and series.</li>
    <li>Gain experience using some basic programming in python to help
    learn mathematics.</li> 
    <li>Improve your skills at communicating problem solving
      strategies in writing, both for yourself and for others. </li>
    <li>Have fun while learning a lot. </li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>Course Structure and Pacing</h3>

<p>This is the thirteen time I've taught this course, so 
  I think have a very good feel for how this will go. However. I have
  been increasingly unhappy with the material in past versions of
  Calculus II. The traditional topics taught in the traditional way
  are, at best, somewhat tedious and not current. At worst, a
  traditional Calculus II class teaches students to do things that
  computers can do for you, which ends up not only being unnecessary
  but actively obscures the key ideas of integral calculus. So I'm
  going to try something new that I think will be really good, but I'm
  sure won't be perfect.
  <ul>
    <li>I am convinced that coding up some of the ideas and procedures
      from integral calculus is a great way to gain a true conceptual
      understanding. So we'll learn some basic python as part of this
      class.</li>
    <li>The main goal of learning python is to use it to learn
      calculus. But, of course, programming is a super valuable skill
      that is used across the sciences, the social sciences, and
      basically everywhere.</li>
    <li>Since this class will be small, I would like to do a lot more
      "hands-on" explorations and even less lecturing than I usually
      do.</li>
  </ul>
  
 <!-- There are a
  handful of enhancements to the course that I'm eager to try out this
  time around: lab sessions and some new assignments.-->
 <!-- first time doing this class on zoom, so there are some things I am
  uncertain of:
  <ul>
    <li>It will take me a little while to get used to the mechanics
    of the class: writing with a sharpie on paper instead of a
    chalkboard, looking for questions in the chat, etc. Your patience
      and feedback is appreciated. </li>
    <li>It will also take time for me to figure out the pace of the
    class: how much we can comfortably cover in sixty minutes on
      Zoom.</li>
    <li>In addition to zoom, it is easy to for me to make videos
    presenting content or working through examples. We can adjust the
    ratio of recorded content to live zoom as needed.</li>
    <li>This class meets three times a week instead of the usual
    two. This gives us of flexibility, room to experiment, and the
    ability to take a snow day or two.</li>  
    <li>Ruminations on help sessions are below in a separate
      section.</li>
  </ul>-->
</p>

<p class="no-box">
 There will be several different parts to the course, each with a
 somewhat different feel:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Accumulation of change. Here we'll learn different ways to
      calculate accumulated change. This will involve a good bit of
      programming. This part of the course will probably seem
      unrelated to Calculus I, and at times may seem a little bit more
      like a programming class than a math class. Toward the end of
      this part we'll introduce a construction known as the  definite
      integral.</li> 
    <li>The fundamental theorems of calculus. This part will be less
      computational and more mathematical. We'll see that the change
      accumulator (the definite integral) is closely related to the
      derivate from Calculus I. So at this point it should become
      clearer why this course is called Calculus II.</li>
    <li>Applications of integrals. Here we will learn several
      different ways that the definite integral get used. We'll likely
      have seen some of the applications or contexts in the first part
      of the course, but now we'll be able to explore them in a little
      more depth.</li>
    <li>Sequences and series. This is a topic that is somewhat separate
      from the rest of the course. This part of the course will a mix
      of programming and pencil-and-paper math. This part of the
      course will have a different feel to it. Most students find this
      a nice change of pace and a good way to end the course.</li>
  </ol>
<p>We will kinda sorta cover chapters 5-10 in
  the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deborah-Hughes-Hallett-Calculus-Single-Multivariable/dp/B008UBBTME/">textbook</a>,
  but I won't really be sticking pretty closely to the book.  As such,
  <b>there is no required text for this class</b>
</p>


<h3>Class and Lab Meetings</h3>
<p><ol>
  <li>This class meets three times a week. Class usually will be a mix
    of me presenting stuff and you working on stuff in groups. </li>
  <li>Some weeks, depending on scheduling and weather and life, class
  may only meet twice a week.</li>
  <!--<li>Labs meet once a week.  You only need to attend one lab
    session.  Labs are an important part of the class. They are not
    optional.</li>-->
  <li>We will do a wide range of things in class. I'm excited to
  try out some new stuff. These will include both creative/artistic
    explorations and maybe some physical experiments.</li>
    
<!--  <li>Video stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>As much as possible, please keep your video turned on during
	class. This will help you stay engaged and will help me have a
	sense of how class is going. I have been teaching a long time
	and am generally good at gauging whether or not a class is
	following what I'm teaching.  But I won't be able to do this if
	I'm looking at a screen full of black rectangles.</li> 
      <li>Of course if you have connection problems or if you need to turn
	the camera off for a few minutes, that's fine.</li>
      <li>It's ok to wear pajamas to class. </li>
      <li>Pets are welcome to join in. Especially cats.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>I plan on turning on zoom at 9:30 but not starting class until
    9:45.  Please feel free to come early and hang out.  Some days I
    might still be getting ready for class.  Some days I might play some
    music (which you can mute if you don't like).  Other days I'll be
    available to chat.  Most days class will end around 10:45, but I'll
    keep zoom open until around 11:00 in case people have questions,
    want to talk, etc.</li>    
  <li>I strongly encourage you to take handwritten notes.  The
    physical component of taking notes helps to keep you engaged.  And
    taking handwritten notes requires you to do some on-the-fly
    synthesis and prioritization, deepening your understanding.</li>
  <li>During class there will frequently be times where you will work
    in small groups on problems. Figuring out the best way to do this
    on Zoom might take some trial and error.</li>-->
</ol>
</p>




<h3>Homework and Exams</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    math, and also this is most of what
    your evaluation will be based on.</li>
  <li>There will be two parts to almost every homework assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	google classroom</li>
    </ol>
  <li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. I use this system even
    when the world is not in a global pandemic.  There are three reasons 
    why I use WeBWorK:
    <ol>
      <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	many times until you get everything correct.</li>
      <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	final answer. </li>
      <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	grading.</li>
      </ol></li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first 
    time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
    with others and seeking help if you need it.</li>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
    check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
  <li>In addition to weekly homework, there will be a few larger,
    synthetic, and hopefully creative and fun assignments. There may
    also be one or two short, un-timed, open-notes exam-like
    assignments. </li>
  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
    phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
    not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
    ever). For some of the labs you (or your lab partner) will need a
    laptop or tablet.</li>
  </ol>
  
</p>


<h3>Help Sessions</h3>
<p>
Noelle and I will have a handful of help sessions
every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
Things that happen at help sessions: 
<ol>
  <li>Noelle and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session. They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
    specific questions.</li>
<!--  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.-->
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>I am aiming to have coffee/tea and snacks available at most help
  sessions. I can't promise this will always work out, but we'll give
  it a try.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>You should also feel free to reach out to me and the Teaching
  Assistants with questions. If you're stuck on a problem, it might
  help to take a photo of what you've done so far and include it in an
  email to us. We might be able to help you with a short email, or we
  could set up a time to meet on zoom</p>
      


<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown.
</p>





<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">Roughly...
<ul>
  <li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 100 percent.</li>
  <!--<li><b>Lab Assignments:</b> 20 percent.</li>
  <li><b>Midterm:</b> 10 percent.</li>
  <li><b>Final:</b> 10 percent.</li>-->
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.  In evaluating work, I'm
  mainly looking for evidence of engagement. I'd like to talk more
  about my grading (non)philosophy, perhaps in week two, once the
  course is up and running.</p>


  
  
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>I will be more or less use the following textbook for Calculus I in
  fall 2022 and Calculus II in winter 2023: 5th edition,
  Hughes-Hallett et al, Calculus.  Single variable.  Paperback:
  ISBN-10: 0470089156.  ISBN-13: 978-0470089156 Hardcover:  ISBN-10:
  0470131594.  ISBN-13:  978-0470131596.  More recent editions of this
  book are very similar.</p> 

<p>You do not need to buy a copy of this book. We are covering
  standard topics in this class (although in a very non-standard way),
  and there are many good online calculus resources.  If you want a
  physical calculus book to use, I have many to loan out.</p>

<!--
<p>  There are many different editions of this book.  When you buy it,
  be sure you are getting the correct one.  The best way to do this is
  to search for it via the ISBN.  The ISBN is unique for each version
  of the book.  E.g., the 3rd and 4th version of the same book will
  have different ISBNs.</p> 

<p>This book costs as much as $120 dollars if you buy it new.
  However, you can get a used copy of the book for around $5 online
  plus a few dollars for shipping.  Yup.  For under $10 you can get
  your very own copy of an excellent calculus textbook.</p> 

<p>Why is the book so inexpensive?  The edition of the book that we're
  using is not the newest edition.  As a result, there are many, many
  used copies available online.  Most colleges have already switched
  editions, but I thought it didn't make sense to, since so far as I
  can tell there is no significant difference between the different
  editions, other than switching around the exercises.  (The only
  reason publishers come out with new editions of calculus textbooks
  is to undercut the used book market.  Calculus itself hasn't changed
  in over a century.)</p> 

<p>To find the book online go to amazon.com or abe.com (or your
  favorite used bookseller) and search using one of the ISBNs
  above. </p>

<!--<h3>Official Syllabus</h3>
<p>
A one-page listing of the topics we'll cover in this course can be
found <a href="./calc1_syllabus_2021.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
-->  

<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 3 hr/wk in class,
      1.5 hr/wk in lab, 1 hr/wk reading, 9.5 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
