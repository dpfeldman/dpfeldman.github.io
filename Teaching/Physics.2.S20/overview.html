<!--<blockquote>
    Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
    more fun to teach than the calculus. It is like being the
    ringmaster of a great three-ring circus. It has been said that one
    can recognize the students on a college campus who have studied
    the calculus -- they are the students with no eyebrows. In utter
    astonishment at the incredible applicability of the subject, the
    eyebrows of the calculus students have receded higher and higher
    and finally vanished over the backs of their heads.

<h3>Basic Info</h3>

<p><ul>
<li><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave">Dave
Feldman</a><br>
<li><b>Email:</b>dfeldman@coa.edu
<li><b>Pronouns:</b> he/him/his
<li><b>Problem Solving Sessions:</b> TBA, via Zoom. (only for COA students)
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ol>
    <li>Maintain intellectual and personal connection in a time of
      dispersal and isolation.
    <li>Experience the challenge, joy, and beauty of theoretical
    physics. 
    <li>Gain a firm, grounded, enduring understanding of the basic
    elements of special relativity. 
    <li>Improve your problem solving skills and mathematical
    confidence. 
</ol>
</p>


<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>For each unit I wil post a number of videos.
    <li>Interspersed beween these videos will be short quizzes.  These
      quizzes are required, but ungraded.
    <li>There will be weekly problem sets, most or all of which will
    be on <b><a href="http://www.edfinity.com">Edfinity</a></b>.  Some
    assignments may also have a component on 
    google classroom.
    <li>There is a piazza discussion forum.  You can ask questions
    here, help answer other students' questions, and take part in
    general discussions.
    <li>We will read a book by Peter Galison.  We'll engage with this
    text through some combination of short writing assignments, blog
    posts, and small group discussions.  
  </ul>
</p>
    

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>I will follow the exposition in Thomas
  A. Moore, <i><a href="http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas/index.html">Six
  Ideas that Shaped Physics</a>:  Unit R: The Laws of Physics are
  Frame-Independent</i>, McGraw Hill, 1998.  You do not, however, need
    to purchase the text.
  <li>We will also read Peter Galison, <i>Einstein's Clocks and
  Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time</i>, WW Norton & Company, 2004.  I
    will use the course fee to get a copy of this book for each of you.
  </ul>

<h3>Official Syllabus</h3>
<p>
A one-page listing of the topics we'll cover in this course can be found <a href="./calc2_syllabus.pdf">here</a>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">Roughly...
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 70 percent.
<li><b>Paper/Blog Posts/Discussions:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Participation in Discussion Forum:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.  This is an unusual time.
I'd strongly consider taking this class without letter grades.
Perhaps for some of you not having letter grades will reduce anexity.
I'm happy to talk through options if anyone wants. 
</p>



<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>


<li>There will be one homework assignment for each unit.  It is
  essential that you do these assignments, as this is most of what
  your evaluation will be based on.  

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
  phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
  not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
  ever).  

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
    check your email/classroom regularly.  

<li>Academic misconduct---cheating, plagiarizing, etc.---is bad. Any cases of 
academic misconduct may result in a judicial hearing. Here is the 
faculty-approved statement about plagiarism:

</ol>
</p>


<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 4 hr/wk "in" class,
      1 hr/wk on discussion forums, 2 hr/wk reading, 1hr/wk writing
      papers/blog posts, 7 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
