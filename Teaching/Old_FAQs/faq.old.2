<h3>Why did you stop giving the assessment test to incoming students??</h3>

I gave the test for the first three years I was at COA: 1998-2000.  I 
found that the information we got from the test wasn't that helpful.
Administering the test took a lot of time, was not a lot of fun for
most students, and was borderline traumatic for some.  Thus, it
doesn't seem worth it to me to give the test.  Since I've stopped
giving the test, I haven't noticed that students have had a difficult
time placing themselves in courses.  I have no plans to return to
administering the test.

<a name="Q0">
<h3>Numerically, how do I interpret my score on
assessment test?  How did I get a score higher than the number of
questions on the test??</h3>

If you took the test in the fall of 2000, your test had only 30
questions on it.  Previous years' tests had 60 questions.  I wanted to
make the scores from different years mean roughly the same thing.
Thus, I multiplied the scores from 2000 by two.  (I.e., if you got 22
questions right out of 30, I reported your score as a 44.)

<h3>What's the deal with Physics III?</h3>


Physics III is a new course that I will offer for the first time this
Winter.  (The course has not been given final approval by the academic
affairs committee.)  Physics III will be a broad introduction to
quantum mechanics.  The focus will be on learning what's strange about
quantum mechanics -- how does quantum mechanics differ from classical 
mechanics, the physical theory that describes how the objects of
everyday experience move and interact with each other?  What is the
experimental evidence to quantum mechanics?  This course is designed
to appeal to both student who anticipate concentrating in the
sciences, as well as those who need a QR credit and/or who want to
learn some cool stuff about quantum mechanics.<p>

Physics I and II are not prerequisites for Physics III.  The level of
mathematics in Physics III will be similar to that of Physics II -- there
will be a fair amount of algebra and trigonometry.  Calculus is not
needed. <p>

<h3>What's the deal with the Quantitative Reasoning Requirement?</h3>

As clearly stated in the course catalog, students are expected to
fulfill the quantitative reasoning (QR) requirement during their first
two years at COA.  To fulfill this requirement, a student must take at
least one QR course.  QR courses include, but are not limited to, math
courses. <p>

Many students delay taking a QR course.  This is
certainly understandable, and I'm well aware of the other requirements
that entering students must complete:  Core course, writing, and
history.  However, there are some reasons why I think it's better to
take a QR course sooner rather than later:
<ol>

        <li>  With a solid math and quantitative reasoning background,
        students will get much more out of some classes, especially
        science and economics classes.   

        <li>  Students with weak math skills worry that a QR course will
        be difficult and/or unpleasant.  However, waiting to take a QR
        course won't make it any easier.  I think it's better to take
        a math course before too much high school math is forgotten.
</ol>

On the other hand, I think it's very important that you find some
courses during your first several terms that really excite you.  Make
sure to take some classes you're passionate about; don't load yourself
up with uninspiring classes just for the sake of meeting your
requirements quickly.

<a name="Q3">
<h3>What Math is Needed for Other Classes?</h3>


The short answer is that it depends.  Ask the teacher of the class
you're interested in taking.  This is just a very rough guide.

<ul>
<li><b>Biology I and II</b> require some familiarity with
algebra, functions and interpreting graphs.  Students who got below a
20 (or so) on the diagnostic test and/or students who have difficulty
applying math to concrete problems may have difficulty with some of
the math used in these courses.  These students may wish to
take college algebra before taking a quantitative science
course.  At a minimum, students who fall in this category should be
aware that some of the math used in biology and ecology may
be difficult for them and that some review or extra work may be
required.   For more detailed information about the math
needed for biology study, consult one of the faculty members in
biology.<p> 

<li><b>Ecology</b> (Instructor: John Anderson) and <b>Evolution and
Ecology</b> (Instructor: Chris Petersen) both require a
firm understanding of algebra.  Students with a weak algebra
background might have difficulty with these courses. <p>

<li><b>Intro to Chemistry II</b> and <b>Physics I and II</b>
make extensive use of algebra.  Physics also uses some basic
trigonometry.  Chemistry I uses algebra, but much less heavily than
Chem II.  Students who do not have a reasonably firm command of
algebra  and/or students who have difficulty applying math to concrete
problems may have difficulty with some of the math used in these
courses.  These students may wish to take math for understanding
functions before taking a physics or chemistry course.  At a minimum,
these students should be aware that some of the math used in
chemistry, and physics may be difficult for them and that some review
or extra work may be required.  On the other hand, many students have
found that taking chemistry and/or physics is a great way to review
algebra and problem solving.  In these classes there are almost always
math tutors available to assist students who need it.
<p>  

<li><b>Biomechanics</b>. (Instructor:  Helen Hess.)  Prerequisites:
One college level course in Biology and one college level course in
Math or Physics, or consent of the instructor.  Biomechanics satisfies
the quantitative reasoning requirement and will be offered in fall
term, 2002 and again sometime in 04-05.  The level of math in
Biomechanics is similar to that used in Physics II.<p>

<li><b>Introduction to Statistics I</b>.
(Instructor: Sean Todd (<a
href=mailto:stodd@ecology.coa.edu>stodd@ecology.coa.edu</a>).)
Prerequisites:  A firm algebra background.  <p>

<h3>What math is needed for graduate school?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This depends, of course, on what sort of graduate school you're
interested in.  I believe that almost all science grad schools as well
as medical and veterinary schools require two terms of calculus.
These programs also usually require at least two terms of physics too.
Some social science/economics programs probably also require some
calculus and also a term or two of statistics.  For a more definitive
answer, you should consult the grad school(s) you're interested in.
Most graduate programs list admissions requirements on their
website.  Depending on the sort of economics program you're interested
in, you may also need some additional advanced classes, such as
Calculus III, Linear Algebra, or computer programming. Most science
grad schools will also want you to have taken some physics. <p>

<ul>
<li>This course is designed for students who are not ready for or
don't want to take Calculus or Statistics, but
who need a QR course and/or want to learn some interesting and fun
math.  It is not a systematic review of algebra and is not
specifically designed to prepare students for further study in the
sciences or mathematics.  This class is highly interdisciplinary, and
emphasizes connections between chaos, fractals, and many different
fields of study.  Students who need a more thorough review of algebra
are strongly encouraged to take either College Algebra or Physics I or
Chemistry II.  For more info on Chaos and Fractals, check out the <a

particular, you might want to look at <a

<a name="Q4.5">
<h3>Should I take Nature and Language of Mathematics or Intro to Chaos
and Fractals?</h3>

Both of these courses are somewhat non-traditional, in that students
will read non-textbooks and will write essays in addition to solving
problems.  Also, neither of these courses is a systematic journey
through a typical algebra or pre-calculus curriculum.  Both of these
courses are designed primarily for students whose interests lie
outside of the sciences.  (Science students are, of course, still
welcome!  However, these courses aren't designed to prepare students
for further science or math study.  But they won't hurt, either.)

Here are some things to consider as you decide which course is for
you: 

<ul>
<li>Read the descriptions of these courses <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Course_Descriptions/index.html">on
the web page</a>.  
<li>Of the two, Intro to Chaos and Fractals is the more
advanced course.  Chaos and Fractals will be taught at a
"pre-calculus" level -- although it will be very different than
a pre-calculus course.  Here's one way to decide which level course is
best for you:  When taking the diagnostic test, which of the following
more accurately describes your response to the test?
<ol>
<li><i>I used to know how to do this!  I've forgotten a bunch over the
summer (or over the years).  I'm confident that with some review, I
could do most of the problems on this test.</i>
<li><i>I've seen this stuff before, but I don't think I ever really
really understood it.  I didn't do that well in math in high school.</i>
</ol>
If you answered 1, then Chaos and Fractals is probably best for
you.  If you answered 2, The Nature and Language of Mathematics is
likely the best course. 
<li>Talk to me.  If you're unsure about which course to take, drop me
an email or stop by and we can discuss the two courses, what you're
looking for in a math course, etc.

<h3>Do math courses taken at other colleges "count"?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In general, yes, math classes at other college can meet COA's QR
requirement.  But to be sure, you should check with me and/or the
college registrar.  Taking a course at another college is a good 
option for some students, especially those who are having a difficult
time fitting all the COA requirements into their schedule and/or who
might rather take their math at a less expensive college.

<h3>Can I place out of the QR requirement?</h3>

you need to take one QR course while at COA (unless you're a transfer
student.)  The idea is that all students, as part of their
interdisciplinary B.A. in human ecology, should take at least one
course that requires quantitative reasoning or symbolic thinking.

<h3>Should I take Calculus?  Am I ready for Calculus?  Do I need to
take Calculus?</h3>

Here are some things to consider as you're contemplating whether or
not to take calculus. 

<ul>
<li> Many students who are good at and/or like math feel they
are ``supposed to'' take calculus.  Perhaps their parents or siblings
took calculus in college, or maybe they want the challenge, or maybe
they just feel it's next in line.  For many of these students,
calculus is indeed an appropriate and fun course.  However, statistics
is another option.  Statistics is, arguably, more important for a
human ecologist than calculus.  And statistics is certainly used more
in other classes at coa than calculus.  So, don't feel like you "have
to" take calculus.  Take it if you want to take it.

<li>On the other hand, calculus is required by many graduate schools.
So, if you're planning on going to grad school in the sciences or even
the social sciences, you'll probably need to take calculus at some
point.  

<li>Also, calculus is required for most of advanced math classes
offered at COA, including:  Differential Equations, Chaos and Complex
Systems, Calculus III, and Linear Algebra.  If you think you might be
interested in advanced physics or math, it's a good idea to take
calculus sooner rather than later. 


<li>If you had a decent algebra and trig course at some point in your
past, you're probably ready for calculus.  It's not important that you
remember lots of trig identities and the properties of logarithms.
It is important, however, that you've had some practice working with
and thinking with functions.  Calculus is not a very difficult course;
it is not a huge leap harder than Precalc or algebra and trig.  Many
students (myself included) found calculus to be significantly less
difficult than precalculus.  For most, calculus "makes sense" and is a
lot more logical than precalculus or trigonometry.  If the last math
class you took was a long time ago, don't worry.  There are lots of
tutors to help you remember the stuff you might have forgotten.  It
will come back to you quicker than you expect.  In the past, students
have taken calculus at COA and done very well, despite the fact that
their last math class was ten years in the past.

<h3>I've taken Calculus before, can I start in Calc II?  Should I take
Calculus at all?</h3> 
<ul>
<li> If you had calculus before, I recommend that you not take
calculus I, unless you had a <i>really</i> bad calculus experience.
If your calc experience was in the ok to pretty good range, then you
might consider taking Calc II.  In Calc II we cover techniques of
integration, applications of integration, and sums and series.  We
also do a fair amount of review of derivatives.  If you had a good,
solid calculus experience, then it's probably in your best interest to
skip Calc I and II.  By solid experience, I mean that you felt like
you "got" many of the things you covered in calculus, not that you
remember tons of formulas.  <p>

The above is just a set of guidelines, however.  If you had calc
before, it's probably a good idea to talk with me about what Calc, if
any, you should take at COA.<p>

<h3>I've taken Physics before.  Should I take Physics I?  What about
Physics II?</h3> 
<ul>
<li> Physics I concentrates on conservation of energy and momentum,
and also covers a basic treatment of Newton's Laws (F=ma and such).
If you've had a good physics class before, you probably don't want to
take physics I -- it might not be challenging.  On the other hand, 
you'll probably find that Physics I covers familiar topics in a
different and (hopefully) interesting way.  As such, you might still
be interested in Physics I.<p>

Physics I is an excellent course for students who want to improve
their quantitaitve problem solving skills and review algebra.  It is
taken by many students as their only QR course.  I think it's also a
course that's well suited for first or second year students.<p>

Physics II spends about half the time on electricity and magnetism.
The topics we covere are fairly standard; if you had physics before,
you'll find this part of the class familiar.  The other half of
Physics II is spent on an in-depth treatment of Einstein's special
theory of relativity.  This material is rarely taught at this level in
high schools or international baccalaureate granting institutions.
Thus, even if you've had a fair amount of physics before, you'll
probably still learn lots of new stuff in Physics II.<p>

Biomechanics and Physics III each cover topics that are almost never
taught in high school.  So if you've had Physics before, you'll
definitely learn new stuff in these two courses. <P>

The above is just a set of guidelines, however.  If you have questions
about the different physics options at COA, please come see me.<p>

almost surely be offered again in 2003-04. Calculus I and II are
prerequisites for the course.  This course is especially recommended
for students with an interest in mathematical modeling, and students
interested in going to graduate school in physics, chemistry, some
fields of economics, and some sorts of biology.<p>

<li><a href="Course_Descriptions/DynSys.shtml">Chaos and Complex
Systems</a> was offered in Fall 2001.  I expect to offer it again in
04-05.  This course is a survey of a range of topics in modern 
nonlinear mathematics, including, but not limited to:  discrete
dynamical systems, cellular automata, boolean networks, agent-based
models, game theory, chaos, and fractals.  Calculus I and II are
prerequisites for the course.  <p>

<li>While not strictly post-calculus, <a
href="Course_Descriptions/Data.Analysis.shtml">Field Ecology and Data
Analysis</a> is an advanced course that uses lots of statistics.  This
course is strongly recommended for students with a good math aptitude
who are interested in field biology.<p>
