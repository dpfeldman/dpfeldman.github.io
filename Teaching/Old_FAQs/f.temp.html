<h3>Who should take Introduction to Chaos and Fractals?</h3>

<p>
This course is designed for students who are not ready for or don't
want to take Calculus or Physics, but who need a QR and/or an ES
course, and/or want to learn some interesting and fun math.  It is not
a systematic review of algebra and is not specifically designed to
prepare students for further study in the sciences or mathematics.
This class is highly interdisciplinary and emphasizes connections
among chaos, fractals, and many different fields of study.  Students
who need a more thorough or systematic review of algebra are 
encouraged to take Physics I or Chemistry II.  Intro to Chaos and
Fractals is probably the least traditional QR class regularly
offered at COA.</p>

<h3>What advanced math courses are there?</h3>

<p>There are a number of options, including <b>Differential
    Equations</b>, <b>Linear Algebra</b>, and <b>Calculus III</b>. 
</p>

<p>I also offer tutorials to small groups of motivated students in
intermediate and advanced topics.  If you think you might be
interested in a tutorial, let me know.  From time to time I also do
independent studies or small research projects with advanced
students.

<h3>Is computer programming offered?</h3>


<p>I incorporate python programming in Differential Equations, which
  I expect to next teach in Winter 2019.</p>

<h3>I think I need a precalc class, but I don't see a pre-calculus
class listed.  What should I do?</h3> 

<p>Are you sure you need a pre-calc class?  You <a href="Q4.75">don't
need</a> to have taken a class called pre-calc to take calculus.  If
you haven't had enough algebra to take calculus, I think the best
thing to do is to take Physics I.  This is probably the best class for
solidifying algebra and learning some basic trigonometry.</p>

<h3>I'm really bad at math, I'm intimidated by
it, or I just plain dislike it.  What should I do?</h3>

<p>My experience has been that almost all COA students who fit this
description are able to find a QR class that works for them.
Introduction to Chaos and Fractals is probably the most basic math
class at COA, in that it relies the least on a prior knowledge of
algebra.  If you're looking for something more concrete, a physics or
chemistry class might be for you.  There are lots of different courses
that meet the QR requirement.  Talk to me or drop me an email and
we'll figure something out</p>

<p>The exams in math and physics classes at COA are untimed and open
notes.  So you don't need to race to finish problems, and you can
consult your notes or the textbook.  I've found that this usually
significantly lessens students' math anxiety.  Almost all math,
physics, and chemistry classes have a least one student teaching
assistant, so there will be plenty of opportunity to get help.</p>

<h3>I really like math and physics.  I want to get a strong background
in these subjects. What should I do?</h3> 

<p>I really like math and physics, too.  And I also really enjoy
computer programming.   There
are a good number of intermediate to advanced classes at COA,
especially in mathematics.  I also am usually able to offer tutorials
if there is an intermediate or advanced topic that a few students want
to learn about. </p>

<p>There are also opportunities off campus.  
Students can also take a term or two at another college as a visiting
student.  In the not-too-distant past, COA students have gone to the
  University of Washington and Smith College to take some advanced
  math classes that aren't offered at COA.  Also, there are lots of
  opportunities to do research internships in the summer.</p> 

<p>The bottom line is that I've found that COA students are able to
get an excellent background in math and quantitative analysis.</p>
