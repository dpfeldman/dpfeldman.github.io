<h3>Why did you stop giving the assessment test to incoming students??</h3>

I gave the test for the first three year: 98-00.  I found that the
information we got from the test wasn't that helpful.  Administering
the test took a lot of time, was not a lot of fun for most students,
and was borderline traumatic for some.  Thus, it doesn't seem worth it
to me to give the test.

<h3>Numerically, how do I interpret my score on
assessment test?  How did I get a score higher than the number of
questions on the test??</h3>

If you took the test in the fall of 2000, your test had only 30
questions on it.  Previous years' tests had 60 questions.  I wanted to
make the scores from different years mean roughly the same thing.
Thus, I multiplied the scores from 2000 by two.  (I.e., if you got 22
questions right out of 30, I reported your score as a 44.)

<h3>What's the deal with the Quantitative Reasoning Requirement?</h3>

As clearly stated in the course catalog, students are expected to
fulfill the quantitative reasoning (QR) requirement during their first
two years at COA.  To fulfill this requirement, a student must take at
least one QR course.  QR courses include, but are not limited to, math
courses. <p>

Many students delay taking a QR course.  This is
certainly understandable, and I'm well aware of the other requirements
that entering students must complete:  Core course, writing, and
history.  However, there are some reasons why I think it's better to
take a QR course sooner rather than later:
<ol>

        <li>  With a solid math and quantitative reasoning background,
        students will get much more out of some classes, especially
        science and economics classes.   

        <li>  Students with weak math skills worry that a QR course will
        be difficult and/or unpleasant.  However, waiting to take a QR
        course won't make it any easier.  I think it's better to take
        a math course before too much high school math is forgotten.

<h3>What Math is Needed for Other Classes?</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Biology I and II</b> require some familiarity with
algebra, functions and interpreting graphs.  Students who got below a
20 (or so) on the diagnostic test and/or students who have difficulty
applying math to concrete problems may have difficulty with some of
the math used in these courses.  These students may wish to
take college algebra before taking a quantitative science
course.  At a minimum, students who fall in this category should be
aware that some of the math used in biology and ecology may
be difficult for them and that some review or extra work may be
required.   For more detailed information about the math
needed for biology study, consult one of the faculty members in
biology.<p> 

<li><b>Ecology</b> (Instructor: John Anderson) and <b>Evolution and
Ecology</b> (Instructor: Chris Petersen) both require a
firm understanding of algebra.  Students with a weak algebra
background might have difficulty with these courses. <p>

<li><b>Intro to Chemistry II</b> and <b>Physics I and II</b>
make extensive use of algebra.  Physics also uses some basic
trigonometry.  Chemistry I uses algebra, but much less heavily than
Chem II.  Students who do not have a reasonably firm command of
algebra  and/or students who have difficulty applying math to concrete
problems may have difficulty with some of the math used in these
courses.  These students may wish to take math for understanding
functions before taking a physics or chemistry course.  At a minimum,
these students should be aware that some of the math used in
chemistry, and physics may be difficult for them and that some review
or extra work may be required.  Understanding functions is not a
prerequisite for these courses.  Students entering the Physics
sequence are expected to be comfortable with math at a pre-calculus
level.<p>  

<li><b>Biomechanics</b>. (Instructor:  Helen Hess.)  Prerequisites:
One college level course in Biology and one college level course in
Math or Physics, or consent of the instructor.  Biomechanics satisfies
the quantitative reasoning requirement and will be offered in fall
term, 200.  The level of math in Biomechanics is similar to that used
in Physics II.<p>

<li><b>Introduction to Statistics I</b>.
(Instructor: Sean Todd (<a
href=mailto:stodd@ecology.coa.edu>stodd@ecology.coa.edu</a>).)   Prerequisites:  A 
firm algebra background. This course will be offered winter term,
2001. <p>

<h3>What math is needed for graduate school?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This depends, of course, on what sort of graduate school you're
interested in.  I believe that almost all science grad schools as well
as medical and veterinary schools require two terms of calculus.
These programs also usually require at least two terms of physics too.
Some social science/economics programs probably also require some
calculus and also a term or two of statistics.  For a more definitive
answer, you should consult the grad school(s) you're interested in.
Most graduate programs list admissions requirements on their
website.<p>

<h3>Who should take The Nature and Language of Mathematics?</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="Course_Descriptions/Nature_and_Language.shtml">The Nature
and Language of Mathematics</a> is an introductory course designed to
help students discover the connections between mathematics and other
areas of human understanding.  There are no pre-requisites for this
course; this course is especially well suited for students with shaky
math backgrounds and/or math phobia. <b>Note:  The Nature and Language
of Mathematics will not be offered 2001-02.</b>

<h3>Who should take Introduction to Chaos and Fractals?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This course is designed for students who are not ready for or
don't want to take Calculus or Statistics, but
who need a QR course and/or want to learn some interesting and fun
math.  It is not a systematic review of algebra and is not
specifically designed to prepare students for further study in the
sciences or mathematics.  Students who need
a more thorough review of algebra are strongly encouraged to take
either College Algebra or Understanding Functions.  For more info on
Chaos and Fractals, check out the <a
href="Course_Descriptions/Chaos.shtml">course description</a> In
particular, you might want to look at <a

<a name="Q4.5">
<h3>Should I take Nature and Language of Mathematics or Intro to Chaos
and Fractals?</h3>

Both of these courses are somewhat non-traditional, in that students
will read non-textbooks and will write essays in addition to solving
problems.  Also, neither of these courses is a systematic journey
through a typical algebra or pre-calculus curriculum.  Both of these
courses are designed primarily for students whose interests lie
outside of the sciences.  (Science students are, of course, still
welcome!  However, these courses aren't designed to prepare students
for further science or math study.  But they won't hurt, either.)

Here are some things to consider as you decide which course is for
you: 

<ul>
<li>Read the descriptions of these courses <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Course_Descriptions/index.html">on
the web page</a>.  
<li>Of the two, Intro to Chaos and Fractals is the more
advanced course.  Chaos and Fractals will be taught at a
"pre-calculus" level -- although it will be very different than
a pre-calculus course.  Here's one way to decide which level course is
best for you:  When taking the diagnostic test, which of the following
more accurately describes your response to the test?
<ol>
<li><i>I used to know how to do this!  I've forgotten a bunch over the
summer (or over the years).  I'm confident that with some review, I
could do most of the problems on this test.</i>
<li><i>I've seen this stuff before, but I don't think I ever really
really understood it.  I didn't do that well in math in high school.</i>
</ol>
If you answered 1, then Chaos and Fractals is probably best for
you.  If you answered 2, The Nature and Language of Mathematics is
likely the best course. 
<li>Talk to me.  If you're unsure about which course to take, drop me
an email or stop by and we can discuss the two courses, what you're
looking for in a math course, etc.

<h3>Do math courses taken at other colleges "count"?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In general, yes.  (But to be sure, you should check with me and/or
the college registrar.)  Taking a course at another college is a good
option for some students, especially those who are having a difficult
time fitting all the COA requirements into their schedule and/or who
might rather take their math at a less expensive college.

<a name="Q7.5">
<h3>Can I place out of the QR requirement?</h3>
<ul>
<li>No.  Regardless of whatever math you've had before you came here,
you need to take one QR course while at COA (unless you're a transfer
student.)  The idea is that all students, as part of their
interdisciplinary B.A. in human ecology, should take at least one
course that requires quantitative reasoning or working symbolically.

<a name="Q4.75">
<h3>Should I take Calculus?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Many students who are good at and/or like math feel they
are ``supposed to'' take calculus.  Perhaps their parents or siblings
took calculus in college, or maybe they want the challenge, or maybe
they just feel it's next in line.  For many of these students,
calculus is indeed an appropriate and fun course.  However, statistics
is another option.  Statistics is, arguably, more important for a
human ecologist than calculus.  And statistics is certainly used more
in other classes at coa than calculus.

<a name="Q5">
<h3>I've taken Calculus before, can I start in Calc II?  Should I take
Calculus at all?</h3> 
<ul>
<li> If you had calculus before, I recommend that you not take
calculus I, unless you had a <i>really</i> bad calculus experience.
If your calc experience was in the ok to pretty good range, then you
might consider taking Calc II.  In Calc II we cover techniques of
integration, applications of integration, and sums and series.  We
also do a fair amount of review of derivatives.  If you had a good,
solid calculus experience, then it's probably in your best interest to
skip Calc I and II.  By solid experience, I mean that you felt like
you "got" many of the things you covered in calculus, not that you
remember tons of formulas.  <p>

The above is just a set of guidelines, however.  If you had calc
before, it's probably a good idea to talk with me about what Calc, if
any, you should take at COA.<p>

<h3>What advanced math courses will be offered?</h3>
There are a number of options for those seeking a post-calculus mathy
experience.  

<ul>

<li><a href="Course_Descriptions/DiffEQ.shtml">Applied Ordinary
Differential Equations</a> was offered last spring (2001) and will
probably be offered again in 2003-04. <p>
<p>

<li><a href="Course_Descriptions/DynSys.shtml">Chaos and Complex
Systems</a> will be offered sometime next year 
(2001-2002).  This course is a survey of a range of topics in modern
nonlinear mathematics, including, but not limited to:  discrete
dynamical systems, cellular automata, boolean networks, agent-based
models, game theory, chaos, and fractals.  Calculus I and II are
prerequisites for the course.  <p>

<li>While not strictly post-calculus, <a
href="Course_Descriptions/Data.Analysis.shtml">Field Ecology and Data
Analysis</a> is an advanced course that uses lots of statistics.  This
course is strongly recommended for students with a good math aptitude
who are interested in field biology.<p>

<li>There are a number of tutorials or independent studies that are
available.  One possibilities include <a
href="Course_Descriptions/Quantum.shtml">Quantum Mechanics</a>, <a
href="Course_Descriptions/CalcIII.shtml">Calc III</a> as well as
linear algebra, or a variety of physics
things.  Talk to me if you're interested.
