<h3>Texts</h3>
<br><ol>
<li><i>Chaos: Making a New
Science</i> by <a href="http://www.around.com/">James Gleick</a>.
This is a popular science book and is not a traditional text.

<li><a href="http://chaos.coa.edu"><i>Chaos and Fractals: An Elementary
  Introduction</i></a>, David Feldman</a>, Oxford University Press,
  2012.  (I donate to a local charity the royalties I receive
  from books sold for this class.) I'd suggest checking out the list
  of <a href="http://chaos.coa.edu/errata.html">errata</a>. 


<li>We'll also read a few short papers, and quite likely a short story
  and some poetry.  The exact assignments will depend on the interests
  of the class. 
</ol>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 25 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
<li><b>Short Papers:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

<p class="no-box">In general, I recommend against grades; I believe
they are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
learning.  This is especially true in this class, where I have found
that many of the class activities <i>really</i> don't lend themselves to
letter grading.  However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt)
by following the guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have
any quota of A's, B's, etc. </p> 


<h3>Class Structure and Details</h3>
<br>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.W18">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.W18</a>.

<li>This class meets <b>both</b> the <b>ES</b> and the <b>QR</b>
requirements.  At the same time.  

<li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More
than one unexcused late homework assignment will likely result in me
mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
lowering of your grade.

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't copy their solution and turn it in.

<li>Guidelines for writing up homework problems can be found <a
href="./solutions.html">here</a>.

<li>You will do a final project for this class.  If you wish, you can
collaborate with other students.  Although projects can take varying
forms, most will end up giving a presentation of around 15 minutes
  towards the end of the term.  For more info, see
  the <a href="projects.html">project guidelines</a>.
<!-- and a <a href="final.ideas.html">list of possible project -->
<!-- topics</a>.-->

<li> There will frequently be reading assigned for class.  When this
is the case, you should read carefully and come to class ready to
  discuss and share ideas. 

<li>You will write three short (2-3 page) papers exploring ideas from
    the book by Gleick and/or our discussions.  Information about
    what's expected for the short papers can be found <a
    href="./papers.html">here</a>.

<li> We may need to schedule an extra class or two during
weeks 9 or 10 so we have enough time for the presentations.

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<!--<li>Labs will meet Wednesday afternoons.  There will be very little, if
any, work associated with the labs outside of the labtime itself.  Labs
will take one to two hours; we will arrange to stagger lab groups'
arrival time, as there is only one set of apparatus for most
experiments.  It is important that you attend lab and arrive on time.
It will not be possible to make up missed labs.-->

<!--<li>The labs for this class were developed with the support of the
Maine Space Grant Consortium, via grant # SG-05-31.-->

<li>I expect you to attend class.

<li>Academic misconduct&mdash;cheating, plagiarizing, etc.&mdash;is
    bad.  Any cases of academic misconduct may result in a judicial
    hearing.  Here is the faculty-approved statement about
    plagiarism: <em> By enrolling in an academic institution, a
    student is subscribing to common standards of academic
    honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of
    data is a breach of such standards. A student must make it his or
    her responsibility to not use words or works of others without
    proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence of
    such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
    designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
    dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
    scholarship arise. </em>

  collection of <a href="./description.html">thoughts</a>.
</ol>

<h3>Hours of Academic Engagement</h3>
<p class="no-box">
You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically engaged hours
associated with this one-credit course. These 150 hours will be spent
roughly as follows: 3 hr/wk in class,
4 hr/wk reading and preparing for class discussions, 5 hr/wk on
homework, and 3 hr/wk on your final project.
