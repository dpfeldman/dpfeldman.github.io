<h3>Advice and Informal Description</h3>


<ul>

<!--<li>The most important thing to be aware of is that this is the first
time I've taught this class, and thus I can't state with any
certainty how the class will go or what it will be like.  This is
especially so since this course is a somewhat non-standard bundle of
topics.  Nevertheless, I'm confident this will be a good class; QM is
a great topic, and the readings we'll be doing are very, very good.<p>  -->

<li>I've only taught this class once before, in the winter of 2003.
The class went quite well and was a lot of fun.  It was large (22
students) and taken by students with a wide range of interests. <p>

<li>We will cover just a handful of key ideas, but will do so from a
number of different perspectives.  Some parts of this class will be
quite mathematical, others will be not mathematical at all.  It is
likely that you will enjoy some parts of the class more than
others.  I think that these different perspectives will be
complementary.  However, there might be a little bit of redundancy at
times. <p>

<li> You do not need to have taken Physics I and II here (or anywhere)
to take Physics III.  <p>

<li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea.  If you're
confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
sooner rather than later.  I can't offer assistance if I don't know
who needs it when.  You need to take responsibility to seek help if
you need it.  On a related note ... <p>

<li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I don't
expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first time.
Don't let yourself get frustrated -- I strongly suggest working with 
others and seeking help if you need it. <p>

<li> The exact syllabus for this class is quite flexible; feedback is
encouraged, and will help make the class better.  <p>

<li>You should be aware that this course is quite different than
Physics III courses at other colleges and universities.  <p>

<li>You'll probably spend more time reading and thinking, and less
time doing HW than you did in Physics I and/or II or Calculus.  The
last time I taught the class students reported that discussion with
peers outside of class were particularly valuable. <p>

<li>The study of quantum mechanics has a very different feel to it
than many other areas of physics.  It's weird -- far weirder than
special relativity.  My hope is that this will make you uncomfortable,
but in a good way. <p>

</ul>

<h4>What this course is not:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Many first courses on quantum mechanics emphasize the tremendous
applications of quantum mechanics.  This is understandable; QM can
explain atomic spectra, the specific heat of solids, semi-conductors,
molecular bonding, etc.  Courses with this emphasis are often titled
Modern Physics.  Modern Physics is a standard sophomore/junior level
course for physics and chemistry majors.  This course is not a modern
physics course.  It instead considers in considerable detail a few
very simple QM systems.  The goal is to give insight into the
structure of the theory of quantum mechanics and make clear those
aspects of quantum mechanics that are different than classical
mechanics.  This course is not unique.  A similar, although less
technical, <a
href="http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/StrangeQ/">course</a> has
been offered for years at Oberlin college.  A  
<a
href="http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~leeys/COURSES/ph425/?q=ph425">more
advanced version</a> of this course has been offered a few times at
Oregon State University.  We will be using materials from both of
these courses.  <p>

<li>This course is designed to explain what's new and different and
strange and unsettling about quantum mechanics.  In so doing, we will
have considerable opportunity to discuss wave-particle duality,
causality, non-locality, and other spooky and/or philosophical things.
However, this is not a philosophy course.  In addition to philosophy,
we will read some about the history of quantum mechanics and the
social conditions of the scientists who helped create the theory.
We will not directly cover
such things as quantum healing, quantum psychology, quantum
consciousness, etc.  Nevertheless, this course should put you in a
position to examine these ideas more carefully and thoughtfully.  For
students who are more interested in the philosophical aspects of QM
and less interested in the the mathematical theory, it should be
possible to concentrate on this some independently towards the end of
the course.  <p>

</ul>

<br>

<h4>Rough Outline</h4>

These parts of the course will not be done strictly in sequence; they
will overlap some, especially toward the end of the course. 

<ol>
<li>The first part of the course of the course we will use Dan Styer's
book, <i>the Strange World of Quantum Mechanics</i>.  The last time I
taught this class students like this book, but occasionally wondered
if Styer was overs-implying things.  Also during this part of the
course we'll take a little detour and cover some key ideas from
probability. 

<li>The second part of the course we will dig deeper into some of the
philosophical questions raised by QM.  In so doing we will read a
handful of articles and book chapters that aren't from Styer.  

<li>For the third part, we will use parts of the short book by
McIntyre.  In so doing, we will revisit many of the topics covered by
Styer, but in a much more mathematical way.  Those of you who like
math and abstraction will enjoy this.  I think you will find, however,
that the math doesn't help with the philosophical or conceptual
questions raised by QM.  I suspect at this point that you will 
appreciate Styer's book much more than you might have at first.

<li>We will then look some at the historical development of QM.  There
will be two prongs to this.  One will be scientific, the other
historical and social.  For the scientific prong, we'll use some
materials from traditional modern physics texts.  And for the
historical, we'll read a few essays about the social conditions under
which QM was developed.
