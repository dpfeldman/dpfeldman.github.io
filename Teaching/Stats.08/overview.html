<b>Catalog Description</b><p>

This is an intensive course that investigates the three main
frameworks for modern statistical analysis: parametric analysis, Monte
Carlo and related computational methods, and Bayesian statistics.
Topics during the term will include research design, power analysis,
meta-analysis, parametric statistics, randomization tests, probability
models, likelihood, and maximum likelihood.  Students will learn how
to apply key tools from each analytic framework as well as gain a
theoretical understanding of each tool and an overall sense of the
mathematical structure of statistics.  Students will also gain
proficiency in R or a related statistics platform.  Students will meet
at least weekly with the instructors and will also convene regularly
without the instructors to collaborate on problem sets and for further
discussion.  Evaluation will be based on regular problem sets and
participation in seminar-style class meetings.  Permission of
instructors required.  Calculus III and Linear Algebra are strongly
recommended as pre- or co-requisites.<p>

Intermediate/Advanced. *QR* No lab fee.<p>

<b>Goals</b>

<ol>
  <li>Be able to apply a range of modern statistical techniques to
  problems in a variety of settings.  This includes parametric and
  non-parametric analysis, Bayesian methods, and if time permits,
  computational techniques. 
  <li>Understand the mathematical structure of modern statistics.
  <li>Gain experience using the statistical package <a
  href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.

<b>Course Details</b>

Our text for this class is <a
href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/">Larry Wasserman</a>, <a
href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/index.html">All
of Statistics: A concise Course in Statistical Inference</a>,
Springer, 2004.  We are uncertain of the exact pace of the class, but
our goal is to cover chapters 1-14.  To do so, we will move through
the first five chapters at a brisk pace, but will then slow down.<p>

This class will meet at least weekly.  The students should meet
as a group at least one or two additional times each week.  There will
be six or seven challenging problem sets.  Evaluation will be based on
problem sets and participation in seminar-style class meetings.<p>
