      <h4>Linear Algebra: Official Course Description</h4>
      <p>Thermodynamics is the area of physics concerned with the
      behavior of very large collections of particles. Examples
      include the water molecules in glass of water, the electrons in
      a wire, or the photons given off by a light bulb. Thermodynamics
      studies properties of collections of particles that are largely
      independent of the particles' detail, for example, the tendency
      for heat to flow from a hot object to a cold one. This course
      will begin with a treatment of the first law of thermodynamics
      and basic thermal physics. Topics to be covered include the
      conservation of energy, heat and work, the ideal gas, the
      equipartition of energy, heat capacities, and latent heat. We
      will then move to the second law of thermodynamics, beginning
      with a statistical definition of entropy. This will require
      learning some combinatorics (a mathematical technique for
      counting) and approximation methods for working with very large
      numbers. This statistical approach will enable us to understand
      the origin of the second law of thermodynamics, and will lead
      naturally to statistical definitions of temperature, pressure,
      and chemical potential. We will then turn our attention to two
      broad areas of application. The first of these is heat engines
      and refrigerators, including heat pumps. The second set of
      applications involve free energy and chemical
      equilibrium. Depending on student interest, we will cover
      batteries and fuel cells, phase transitions, adiabatic lapse
      rates in meteorology, and nitrogen fixation. Thermodynamics is a
      broadly applicable field of physics, and so this course should
      be of relevance to students whose interests are in almost any
      area of science or engineering, as well as those who wish to
      gain a general introduction to a field that is one of the
      pillars of modern physical science. Evaluation will be based on
      weekly problem sets and a final research paper, presentation, or
      lab project. Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Calculus II and
      either a college-level physics or chemistry class. Course Limit:
      20. Lab Fee: None. Meets the following degree requirements: QR

      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician Federico Ardila-Mantilla has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are:
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math is a powerful, malleable tool that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.

     <p>This course is closely based on the introductory linear algebra
     class (<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/course/mth-204.htm"
     target="_blank">MTH 204</a>) offered by
     <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/math/" target="_blank">Grand Valley
     State University</a>.  I am grateful to
     <a href="https://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html"
     target="_blank">Professor Matt Boelkins</a>, who shared his
     syllabus and assignments for MTH204. These teaching materials
     were developed collaboratively by the team of faculty at Grand
     Valley who rotate through teaching Linear Algebra.</p>

     <p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://davidaustinm.github.io/"
     target="_blank">David Austin</a> who has made his excellent
     textbook, <a href="" target="_blank">Understanding Linear
     Algebra</a> freely available online. David is a professor at
     Grand Valley State. (Btw, Matt has also written an open textbook
     series, <a href="https://activecalculus.org/"

      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>We will closely
	    follow <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/thermal/"
		      target="_blank">An Introduction to Thermal Physics</a> by
	    <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/"
	       target="_blank">Daniel Schroeder</a>. I would like to
	    cover most of chapters 1-4 and a little bit of chapter 5.</li>
	  <li>The only work for this course will be weekly homework
	    assignments. These problem sets will likely be longer,
	    more challenging, and funner than those you've done for
	    other classes.</li>
	  <li>All work can be <b>resubmitted without penalty</b> up to
	    (roughly) a few weeks after I return it to you.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <p>
	This is my fifth time teaching this course, so I have a pretty
	good feel for how it will go. There are three parts to the
	class, each with a somewhat different vibe:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Chapter 1. This will be conservation of energy in various
	guises. Most of this material will be new to you, but it will
	  have a familiar feel.</li>
	<li>Chapter 2-3. Here we will encounter entropy and the second
	  law of thermodynamics in various guises. This material will
	  be new, some of the math will be new, and it will be a bit
	  abstract and big-picture.</li> 
	<li>Chapter 4-5. Here we will apply all the new stuff from
	chapters 2-3 to a wide array of phenomena. This will be the
	most interesting, challenging, and perhaps the most rewarding
	  part of the class.</li>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-thermometer-half fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>What is Thermodynamics?</h3>
      <p>
	Wikipedia's entry (from December 2024)
	on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"
	target="_blank">thermodynamics</a> has a good summary: 
	
	<blockquote>
	  Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat,
	  work, and temperature, and their relation to energy,
	  entropy, and the physical properties of matter and
	  radiation. The behavior of these quantities is governed by
	  the four laws of thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative
	  description using measurable macroscopic physical
	  quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic
	  constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics
	  applies to a wide variety of topics in science and
	  engineering, especially physical chemistry, biochemistry,
	  chemical engineering and mechanical engineering, but also in
	  other complex fields such as meteorology.
	</blockquote>
      </p>
      
      <p class="no-box">This course covers a fairly standard set of
      thermodynamics
      topics. The <a href="https://physics.weber.edu/thermal/"
      target="_blank">book</a> we'll be using is excellent; I think it
      is clear, covers a good set of topics, and writing is informal,
      concise, welcoming, and extremely effective. There are different
      flavors of thermodynamics courses, usually catering to students
      in a particular major: physics, chemistry, chemical engineering,
      atmospheric science, and so on. Our textbook is intended for
      physics majors, but includes a fair amount of chemistry. I think
      this course will serve as a good foundational thermo class for
      everyone, regardless of their particular reason(s) for learning
      the subject.</p> 

      <p>One of the things I really like about the study of
      thermodynamics is that it is a foundational area of physics that
      explains why some reaction can only occur in one direction, thus
      perhaps explaining why time moves only forward and not
      left-and-right like space. Thermodynamics also explains practical
      things, like how refrigerators and heat pumps work, and why
      little bubble form in a glass of cool water after it sits in
      room temperature for a while.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Stuff about Homework</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be an assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
	  essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
	  math, and also this is most of what your evaluation will be based
	  on.</li> 
	<li><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
	<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
	I think it would be best to not use google classroom to
	submit homework, but instead to submit the assignments on
	actual pieces of paper, like in olden times. But let's
	discuss this.</li>
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
	  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest working
	  with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family. However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3><i class="fa fa-commenting-o fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Other Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> More than
	    any class I teach, in Thermodynamics I find myself
	    lecturing at the board. This has worked well in the
	    past. However, we could consider partially "flipping" the
	    class. I.e., doing reading before we cover a topic in
	    class, or watching videos from the 2021 hybrid version of
	    the course.</li>
	  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific
	    calculator or phone/tablet app. I strongly suggest an
	    actual calculator. You do not need a graphing calculator
	    for this course (or, in my opinion, ever).</li> 
	  <li><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
	    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
	      This class is medium-sized, and there are no teaching
	    assistants. We will have to figure out how optimally
	    schedule help sessions. I suspect this will take a week or
	      two to figure this out.</li>
	  <li>I would also encourage you to schedule some group work
	    times without me.</li>
	  <li> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-fw"></i>
	      Some of the problems in this course are multi-step
	  problems for which the solution path will not be immediately
	  clear. Some problems may take several pages to work
	  through. My hope is that this is challenging and
	    rewarding. </li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3><i class="fa fa-life-saver fa-fw
		    w3-margin-right"></i>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3><i class="fa fa-user-o fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email.  There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for energy projects on campus
	    or in the community.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the
	TAs. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-bullseye fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>What your
      Evaluation is Based on</h3> 
      
      <p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
	assignments. I think there is much to be said against grades; I 
	believe they often interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But
	I am happy to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of
	A's, B's, etc. 
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-universal-access fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is my intent that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
	Hill or Associate Dean Kourtney Collum.

      <h3><i class="fa fa-institution fa-fw
		    w3-margin-right"></i>Statements about Academic Honesty
	  and Hours of Academic Engagement</h3>
      <p>I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</p>
	    
	  <p>I am also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you'll spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </p>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important
      to acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
