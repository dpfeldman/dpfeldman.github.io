      <h4>Linear Algebra: Official Course Description</h4>
      <p>Thermodynamics is the area of physics concerned with the
      behavior of very large collections of particles. Examples
      include the water molecules in glass of water, the electrons in
      a wire, or the photons given off by a light bulb. Thermodynamics
      studies properties of collections of particles that are largely
      independent of the particles' detail, for example, the tendency
      for heat to flow from a hot object to a cold one. This course
      will begin with a treatment of the first law of thermodynamics
      and basic thermal physics. Topics to be covered include the
      conservation of energy, heat and work, the ideal gas, the
      equipartition of energy, heat capacities, and latent heat. We
      will then move to the second law of thermodynamics, beginning
      with a statistical definition of entropy. This will require
      learning some combinatorics (a mathematical technique for
      counting) and approximation methods for working with very large
      numbers. This statistical approach will enable us to understand
      the origin of the second law of thermodynamics, and will lead
      naturally to statistical definitions of temperature, pressure,
      and chemical potential. We will then turn our attention to two
      broad areas of application. The first of these is heat engines
      and refrigerators, including heat pumps. The second set of
      applications involve free energy and chemical
      equilibrium. Depending on student interest, we will cover
      batteries and fuel cells, phase transitions, adiabatic lapse
      rates in meteorology, and nitrogen fixation. Thermodynamics is a
      broadly applicable field of physics, and so this course should
      be of relevance to students whose interests are in almost any
      area of science or engineering, as well as those who wish to
      gain a general introduction to a field that is one of the
      pillars of modern physical science. Evaluation will be based on
      weekly problem sets and a final research paper, presentation, or
      lab project. Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites: Calculus II and
      either a college-level physics or chemistry class. Course Limit:
      20. Lab Fee: None. Meets the following degree requirements: QR

      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician Federico Ardila-Mantilla has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are:
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math is a powerful, malleable tool that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.

     <p>This course is closely based on the introductory linear algebra
     class (<a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/course/mth-204.htm"
     target="_blank">MTH 204</a>) offered by
     <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/math/" target="_blank">Grand Valley
     State University</a>.  I am grateful to
     <a href="https://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html"
     target="_blank">Professor Matt Boelkins</a>, who shared his
     syllabus and assignments for MTH204. These teaching materials
     were developed collaboratively by the team of faculty at Grand
     Valley who rotate through teaching Linear Algebra.</p>

     <p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://davidaustinm.github.io/"
     target="_blank">David Austin</a> who has made his excellent
     textbook, <a href="" target="_blank">Understanding Linear

     Grand Valley State. (Btw, Matt has also written an open textbook
     series, <a href="https://activecalculus.org/"
     target="_blank">Active Calculus</a>, that looks great. I will
     consider using it next fall when I teach Calculus.)

      <h3>Course Structure</h3>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>We will closely
	  follow <a href="https://understandinglinearalgebra.org/ula.html"
	  target="_blank">Understanding Linear Algebra</a> by David
	    Austin. My plan is to cover Chapter 1-4.</li>
	  <li>There will be three sorts of work you will do for this

	    <ul>
	      <li><b>Daily Prep Work</b>. For almost all classes there
	      will be a preview assignment designed to get you warmed
	      up for that day's class. This will be evaluated entirely
	      on effort and completeness. If you don't complete a few
		of the prep assignments, that's ok.</li>
	      <li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments</b>, described
		below.</li>
	      <li><b>Labs</b>. Roughly every other week there will
		be a "lab" that you'll start in class and then finish
		on your own. You'll do this work in pairs. The labs
		are applications or mini case studies.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>All work can be <b>resubmitted without penalty</b> up to
	    (roughly) a few weeks after I return it to you.</li>
	  <li>Your final evaluation will be roughly weighted as
	  follows: Daily Prep (20%), Weekly Homework (50%), Labs
	  (30%).</li>

      <h3>What is Linear Algebra?</h3>
      <p>
	Wikipedia's entry (from 2013, I think)
	on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear 
	  algebra</a> has a good summary:
	
	<blockquote>
	  Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of
	  vectors, with families of vectors called vector spaces or linear
	  spaces, and with functions that input one vector and output another,
	  according to certain rules. These functions are called linear maps (or
	  linear transformations or linear operators) and are often represented
	  by matrices. Linear algebra is central to modern mathematics and its
	  applications. An elementary application of linear algebra is to the
	  solution of a system of linear equations in several unknowns. More
	  advanced applications are ubiquitous... . 
	  <!--, in areas as diverse as abstract
	  algebra and functional analysis. ... 
	  Linear algebra has a concrete
	  representation in analytic geometry and is generalized in operator
	  theory and in module theory.-->
	  It has extensive applications in
	  engineering, physics, natural sciences and the social
	  sciences. [Linear algebra is also important to study because]
	  nonlinear mathematical models can often be approximated by 
	  linear ones. 
	</blockquote>
      </p>
      
      <p class="no-box">There are considerable differences among
	linear algebra courses and textbooks.  Roughly speaking, there are
	three not mutually exclusive roles that linear algebra plays in the
	math curriculum:
	<ul>
	  <li>1: Linear algebra teaches a set of techniques for solving
	    problems.  These classes often emphasize applications. </li>
	  <li>2A: Linear algebra serves as a bridge toward more formal or
	    abstract mathematics.</li>
	  <li>2B: Sometimes this includes introducing students to methods of
	    proof.</li> 
	  <li>3A: Linear algebra can be an entry point for numerical mathematics.
	    This includes using a computer to do mathematics and solve
	    problems.</li>
	  <li>3B: This can also include analyzing the run-time and convergence
	    properties of algorithms and writing original code. </li>
	</ul>
      <p class="no-box">
	This course is mostly of type 1 and 3A, with a little bit of 2A. 
	I'm not certain of the exact balance; this will depend on the
	interests of the class. For more on the particular flavor this
	course, see the
	<a href="https://understandinglinearalgebra.org/preface-1.html"
	   target="_blank">Our Goals</a> section of our textbook. </p>

      
      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Stuff about Homework</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be an assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
	  essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
	  math, and also this is most of what your evaluation will be based
	  on.</li> 
	<li>There will be two parts to almost every homework assignment:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	      google classroom</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. There are three
	  reasons why I use WeBWorK:
	  <ul>
	    <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	      learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	      many times until you get everything correct.</li>
	    <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	      slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	      collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	      since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	      final answer. </li>
	    <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
	      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	      grading.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>I will make comments on your exercises and give one of
	two marks: <b>Success!</b> or <b>Not Yet</b>. A Not Yet mark
	means that you haven't quite demonstrated
	mastery/understanding of the learning goals for that
	exercise. You can resubmit any "Not Yet" assignments without
	penalty. </li>
	
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
	  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest working
	  with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family. However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
	<li>You will need access to a computer or tablet in order to
	read the textbook and do the homework. </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Some Warnings and Things to Think About</h3>
      <p>
	This is my seventh time teaching a version of this course, so
	I have a pretty good sense of how it will go. Some thoughts:
	<ol>
	  <li>There are no official TAs for this course. So we'll have
	  to work creatively to make sure everyone can get the help
	    they need.</li>

	  <li>I am structuring things a little differently,
	  modeled off of the GVSU course. These feels like a minor
	  adjustment, and not a major shift in how I usually teach,
	  but it's definitely a bit of an adjustment. Let's give it a
	  shot and see how it goes.</li>
	  
	  <li>Linear algebra is standard topic in the college
	  mathematics curricula. It is usually taken by students in
	  their sophomore year. Linear Algebra is required for math,
	  physics, engineering, statistics, and economics majors. I
	  suspect it's required for chemistry majors, but I'm not
	  sure. In general, anyone who works in a mathematical field
	  will need to know linear algebra.</li> 

	  <li>My experience as a student was that linear algebra
	  seemed very easy. So I didn't do much work in the class. But
	  then it got harder quite quickly and I was lost and in a lot
	  of trouble. As always, it's important to stay caught up,
	  because you can get left behind pretty quickly in a course
	  like this.</li> 

	  <li>Also, when I took linear algebra I remember thinking
	  that the material was kinda silly and that I would never use
	  it. However, I ended up using linear algebra in almost every
	  math and physics class I took, and I use it in my research
	  all the time---much more than I use calculus. Some of the
	  applications of linear algebra might not be apparent
	  immediately, but please believe me when I say that it is a
	  very useful topic to know. </li> 

	  <li>Linear algebra potentially has some trap doors: things
	  can suddenly shift from easy to very hard without you
	  realizing it. Of course I'm going to try to not let this
	  happen. </li> 

	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email.  There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for energy projects on campus
	    or in the community.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the
	TAs. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>What your Evaluation is Based on</h3>
      
      <p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
	assignments (approx 90%) and your contributions in lab
	sections (approx 10%).  There will be weekly homework assignments
	and, towards the end of the course, some mini-case studies and
	projects.  I think there is much to be said against grades; I
	believe they often interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But
	I am happy to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of
	A's, B's, etc. 
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is my intent that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
	Hill, or Associate Kourtney Collum or Jamie McKown.
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</li>
	    
	  <li>I am also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you'll spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </li> 
	</ul></p>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important
      to acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
