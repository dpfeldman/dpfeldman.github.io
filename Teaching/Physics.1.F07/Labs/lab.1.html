<h3>Fermi Problems</h3>


I'm looking for order of magnitude estimates, not precise answers!
You should round off with reckless abandon, and avoid using a
calculator if at all possible.  

<ol>

<li>Estimate the speed, in mph, at which human hair grows.

<li>Estimate the average speed, in mph, at which a human grows
from age 0 to 18.

<!--
<li>Estimate the total volume of all the blood of all the people in
the world.  Do some conversion or something that would help one
picture or get a feel for how much this volume is.

<li>Estimate the number of piano tuners in Boston.
-->

<li>The pump that is draining New Orleans is pumping 27,000 gallons of
water every minute.  How long do you think it will take to drain the
city?  The area of New Orleans (not counting lakes and canals) is
around 450 square kilometers.
<p>
<br>
</ol>

<h3>A little brain teaser</h3>
You have a drawer containing 8 blue socks, 10 green socks, and 12
orange socks.  You would like to wear a matching pair of socks.  You
grab socks one at a time from the draw.  What is the maximum number of
socks you need to draw before you have a matching pair in your hands?<p>


<p><br>

<h3>Triangles</h3>
<ol>
<li>Using a ruler measure p and q on each of the triangles on sheet
one.
<li>Then do the same for the triangles on sheet two.
<li>Determine the values of p/q.  What does this ratio tell you?
<li>Invent a name for this ratio.  
<li>Get sheet three from Sanjeeva or me and do the problems on it. 
</ol>
