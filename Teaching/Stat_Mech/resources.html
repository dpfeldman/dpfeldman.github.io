<h3>Books</h3>

This is, of course, only a partial list.

<ol>

<li>Nigel Goldenfeld, Lectures on Phase Transitions and the
Renormalization Group.   Addison-Wesley.  1992.  Clear, well written
graduate level text.  Covers many of the topics we'll cover in the
class.  

<li>Julia Yeomans.  Statistcal Mechanics of Phase Transtions.
Clarendon Press. 1992.  Excellent overview of the modern approach to
phase transitions.  Extremely clear, doesn't get bogged down in
mathematical details.  Good place to turn to when you're confused
about the big picture or main ideas.

<li>Mark Newman and Gerard Barkema.  Monte Carlo Methods for
Statistical Physics.  Oxford University Press.  1999.  Excellent book
on Monte Carlo methods.  Along the way, includes some great discussion
of critical phenomena and statistical mechanics.  

<li>Binney, Fisher, Dowrick, Newman.  The Theory of Critical
Phenomena: An Introduction to the Renormalization Group.  Clarendon
Press, 1992.  Very clear book, focusing on an thorough treatment of
the field-theoretic approach to the renormalization group.  Also has
nice discussions of other techniques in critical phenomena.  Good
place to go if you want more detail than Yeomans provides.  


<li>David Chandler.  Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics.
Oxford University Press.  1987.  Very good modern overview of stat
mech and critical phenomena.  Covers most of the topics we'll cover in
this course.  

<li>Claude Garrod.

<li>Beck and Scholgl.
