\noindent This is a small warm-up assignment.  The main goal is for
you to start getting used to the Edfinity system.  You can access
Edfinity here: \url{https://edfinity.com/}.
There is also a link to WeBWorK on the top of the schedule page on the 
course website.  The assignment to do is called Homework00.\\

\noindent If you encounter any problems with Edfinity, please let me
know. \\

\noindent You will get an invitation to joint Edfinity via email, or
you can click on this linke:
\url{https://edfinity.com/join/9TFHWDNH}.\\  

\noindent If you set up an edfinity account but then decide to drop
the course, please delete your account.  This will save the school
a few dollars.  Thanks. \\

\noindent Most assignments will combine Edfinity and written work, to
be submitted on actual paper in my mailbox, but this warm-up
assignment is all online.
