  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
</header>

<p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
assignments.  There will be weekly homework assignments and, towards
  the end of the course, some mini-case studies and projects.  I
  think there is much to be said against grades; I believe they often
  interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But I am happy to
  assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of A's, B's,
  etc.

  <p>what's the deal with this course?</b>
  <h2>More Detailed Info</h2>
</header>

<!-- <li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page.-->
<ol>
<li>This is my ninth time teaching this class, so I have a pretty good
  sense of how it will go.  That said, this course is continually
  evolving.  An ongoing challenge for me is what material to include
  and what to leave out.  I'm also continuing to experiment with the
  ordering of topics. 

<!--<li>During the first part of the course there will almost always be
  homework due at the beginning of class.  Every day.  Evaluation on
  these assignments will be based mostly on effort.  It is essential
  that you do these assignments.-->

<!--<li> During the first part of the course you will be taking a number
  of mastery quizzes.  These are short tests designed to make sure you
  have mastered key skills.  The mastery quizzes must be completed
  without the help of others, and ideally without notes.  You can
  re-take these quizzes if needed. -->

<li>This class will be quite large by COA standards. You and
  I will need to work together to make sure that this classtime is
  comfortable and effective, and that outside of class people are able
  to get all the help they need. I have taught other classes,
  including this one, with more than thirty students and it worked out
  fine. So I'm not worried.   

<li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
  confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
  sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can offer
  help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know who needs
  it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if you need
  it. On a related note ... 

<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
  with others and seeking help if you need it.  

<li>This class, especially at the beginning, will move fairly quickly
  and there will be a lot of work. This course is about building
  quantitative and analytical skills, and the only way to do this is
  through lots of practice. It is essential that you not fall behind.

<li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be very careful to not fall
  farther behind every week.

<li> Homework will almost always be due at the end of the day on
  Friday.  (What this means is that I come to campus sometime Saturday
  morning and empty my mailbox of homework assignments.)  I will
  accept late homework assignments. However, I may 
  not grade these assignments thoroughly.  Multiple late
  assignments will result in a lowering of your grade and a mention in
  your narrative evaluation.

<!--<li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
  no higher than a C. -->

<li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
  also consult me, teaching assistants, other faculty, friends, and
  family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
  understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
  problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
  just copy their solution and turn it in. 

<!--<li> During the second part of the course there will be a significant
  emphasis on group projects.  You will be expected to fully
  participate in these projects and reserve Thursday afternoon lab
  time for group meetings during the second half of
  term. Presentations and final reports will be graded per group. To
  encourage sharing the significant workload, each student will
  complete a confidential peer appraisal reviewing each member's
  contribution to the group.   
-->
 
<li> As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email, it is important that you check your email
  regularly. 

<li> Unless we have made arrangements in advance, you are expected to 
  come to class and participate in group exercises.  

<li>Most homework assignemnts will include some problems assigned on
  Edfinity, an electronic homework platform.  There are several
  benefits to Edfinity:
<ol>
  <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can learn
    right away from your mistakes.  You can submit solutions many
    times until you get everything correct. 
  <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, the TAs and I can
    spend more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
    grading. 
  <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get slightly
  different versions of the questions. This means that collaborating
  with other students will be maximally effective, since you'll have
  to share solution methods and not just the final answer.  
</ol>     
Edfinity takes a little getting used to. If you encounter any problems
  with the platform, be sure to ask for help. 

<li>I recommend acquiring a simple calculator.  You can use your
  phone, but my experience is that calculators are much easier and
  faster to use.  

<li>I am writing a book based on this class.
  I will be writing as the term progresses and sharing updated drafts
  with you.  I'd encourage you to not print out the entire book, as it
  will be changing almost daily.  Feedback and suggestions are welcome.  

<li>In order to supplement what we do in class, I plan on making a
  number of short videos, mostly working through example problems.  If
  you have requests for topics or examples, please let me know.

<li>I would like to experiment with an optional discussion section,
  probably on Friday afternoons.  This will be a chance to discuss
  some of the more complex and multi-layered issues that we won't be
  able to dig into in class, including social and environmental
  impacts of various energy technologies.
  
<!--<li> This class is a lot of work.  It's very important to not fall
  behind.  Doing well on your project will require a significant time 
  investment.  Most of this work will occur weeks 5-10. -->

<li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
  technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
  There is also a temptation to get bogged down in debates about
  policy.  We should collectively resist these temptations; there are
  a lot of important topics to learn about. 

<li>Many of the examples in this class are based on a US context.  I
  will incorporate other contexts as I can, and will try to make clear
  differences between the US and elsewhere in terms of energy. 
  
<li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
  institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
  academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
  fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
  make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
  others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
  evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
  his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
  for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
  discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
  scholarship arise."
  
<li>You should expect to spend 150 hours of academically engaged time
  on this course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 3 hours per
  week in class, in a typical week you'll spend 3.5 hours reading and
  preparing for class and 8.5 hours attending help sessions and
  completing assignments.   

</ol>

  <p>I don't want to be negative, but</p>
  <h2>What this Class Isn't</h2>
</header>
This course is not about the following things, although this course
should help you do/think about the following things better and
more richly.
<ol>
  <li>Energy policy
  <li>Social impacts of energy technologies
  <li>Environmental impacts of energy technologies
  <li>Weatherproofing your house
  <li>Building your own wind turbine
  <li>Climate change and global warming
  <li> A physics class 
</ol></p>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>you can get help, and a lot more, at help sessions</b>
  <h2>Help Sessions</h2>
</header>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions.
You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these sessions.
Things that happen at help session:
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.
  <li>Other students do the problems at home or in the library and
    come to the help session with specific questions. 
  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also wander into other areas: politics,
    the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes are
    offered next term, and so on.
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.
</ol>
Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>there are lots of good reasons why you might want to meet with me
    one-on-one</p>
  <h2>Individual Meetings</h2>
</header>
I am happy to meet with students one-on-one, either in my office or in
the dining hall.  The best way to set up an appointment is to send me
an email.  There are lots of reasons why you might want to me:
<ol>
  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
    explore in a help session.
  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
  uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
  uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
  questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
  nevertheless.)
  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
    internships, senior projects, etc.
</ol>  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
discuss. </p>
