<h3>Informal Description of the Course</h3><br>


<ol>
    <li>   This class is a lot of work, but I think it's less work
    than Calculus I.  
    <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
    confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
    sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can
    offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know
    who needs it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if
    you need it. On a related note ... 
    <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
    first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated -- I strongly
    suggest working with others and seeking help if you need it. 
    <li> In Calc II Maple will be more integrated into the course than
    it was in Calculus I. Knowing how to use a computer algebra and
    graphing system is important and, at times, essential, if you're
    going to do "real-world" and not text-book math. This may be
    frustrating for some, but I'm convinced it's worth it. 
    <li> This class meets three times a week, with the Wednesday time
    listed as a lab. My plan, however, is to treat the three meeting
    times pretty much the same. That is, we'll do lab stuff during
    class, and vice versa. 
    <li> In many more traditional math classes the textbook has a ton
    of examples in them. The book we'll be using doesn't. The result
    is that students sometimes find the homework to be challenging,
    frustrating, and occasionally even annoying. However, I'm
    convinced that this style of homework -- where there's not an
    example just like the problem you're trying to do -- is much
    better pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this way. 
    <li> This course does covers pretty standard Calc II material. The
    text book we're using is used at many other colleges and
    universities in the U.S. 
    <li> Many of you haven't taken Calc I here this year, and might
    not have taken and Calculus at all for a while. Don't worry. In
    the past, people who have taken calculus elsewhere have done very
    well in this course. We will review Calc I material as needed. 
    <li> This class is a lot of work. However, the workload is steady;
    you'll be doing approximately the same amount of work each
    week. We'll hit the ground running and try to get lots of stuff
    done the next few weeks. The workload will taper off some toward
    the end of the term.
