<h1 align=center>Introduction to Chaos and Fractals</h1><p>
<h2 align=center>Homework 7</h2>

<b>Due Thursday 4 May, 2006</b><br><br>

Please do this problem <b>before</b> class on Thursday.  You'll need a
program that can make a bifurcation and let you zoom in and out.  A
good program is at <a
href="http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/applets/OrbitDiagram.html">http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/applets/OrbitDiagram.html</a>.
<br><br>

Try to make sure that your measurements are accurate to at least
several decimal places.  To do so, you'll need to zoom in quite a
bit.  As you do so, you'll likely need to increase the number of
iterates the program plots.  This can be done by increasing the
numbers in the boxes on the left.  The first box, labled "iterations",
changes the total number of iterations the computer calcualtes.  The
second box, labeled "First show", increases the number of iterates
that are discarded before they're plotted on the bifurcation
diagram.<br><br>

If you encounter any difficulties or challenges in determining your r
values, briefly discuss in your write-up.<br><br>

Feel free to work in pairs and hand in just one write-up if you wish.<br><br>
