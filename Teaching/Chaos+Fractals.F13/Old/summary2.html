<h1 align=center> Intro to Chaos and Fractals:  Summary</h1><p>
<p>
<br>



<b>Big Ideas</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Chaos</i>:  A deterministic system that is bounded and
aperiodic and shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions.<p> 

<li><i>Fractals</i>:  Geometric objects that are self-similar across
many scales.  Usually have non-integer dimension.<p>

<li>A simple deterministic system can produce unpredictable
results.  Example:  Logistic equation, Lorenz equations.<p>

<li>A simple deterministic system can produce complicated, ordered
behavior, e.g. period 32 or period 17 cycles in logistic equation.<p> 

<li> Mathematical models are sometimes not used for prediction, but
instead to gain a qualitative feel for a system.<p>

<li>Math and physics are living, human endeavors.  Math and physics
are, in a variety of ways, informed by art, literature, aesthetic
concerns.  <p>

<li>Some features of chaotic transitions are <i>universal</i>.
Example:  Feigenbaum number from the logistic equation is the same as
the number measured experimentally in turbulence experiments.<p> 

<li>Fractals can be produced by simple iterated processes.  Example:
forming fractals by successive removals.<p>

<li>Fractals can also be produced by random processes.  Example:  "The
Chaos game."<p>

<li><i>Strange Attractors:</i>  Attractors of dynamical systems that
are of a dimension smaller than the phase space, and often fractal.
Motion on the attractor, however, is chaotic.  This is an example of
structure or pattern within chaos or disorder.<p>

<li><i>Julia sets</i>:  The set of all initial conditions that do not
fly off to infinity for a particular iterated function.<p>

<li><i>The Mandelbrot set</i>: an encyclopedia of Julia sets.  The
Mandlebrot set is the set of all C values for which the Julia set of
f(x) = x^2 + C is connected.  Equivalently, The M-set is the set of
all C values for which the orbit of 0 under f(x) = x^2 + C is
bounded. <p>
</ul>
<p><br>


<b>Really Big Idea</b>
<ul>
<li>Order?  Disorder?  Order can give rise to disorder and disorder
can give rise to order.
</ul>
<p><br>


<b>Broader Implications of Chaos + Fractals?</b>
<ul>
<li>Definitely started a small trend toward interdisciplinarity.  More
common now for mathematicians, physicists, biologists, economists,
etc., to talk to each other and collaborate.<p>
<li>Helped return physicists' attention to everyday-scale phenomena,
as opposed to the very small, very big, very fast, etc.<p>
<li>Provided some new methods:  phase space embedding, determining
dimensions.  These methods have proved useful in variety of fields.<p>
<li>Important lessons about "causes" of order and pattern and
disorder.  What needs explaining?  What sort of explanations should we
seek? <p>
<li>Chaos and fractals provide a language that is appropriate for
describing and thinking about a wide range of natural phenomena. <p>

<li>Chaos is still a relatively minor sub-field of physics.  Chaos was
not a revolution in the sense that Quantum Mechanics or Evolution or
Plate Tectonics.  Chaos is not really a theory.<p>
<li>Nevertheless, chaos and fractals are fun (at least to many
people) and are an important and still growing area of study.
