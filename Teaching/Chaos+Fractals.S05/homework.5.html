<b>Homework 5:  Due Friday 22 April, 2005</b>.  As on the previous
computer assignment, you can work in pairs and hand in only one set of
answers if you want.<p> 

<b>If you have questions about any of these, be sure to ask me.  These
aren't intended to be tricky or vexing.  If you have computer
difficulties, let me know.</b><p>


To answer these questions, you'll need to use a program to make
bifurcation diagrams.  There are many such programs on the web.  Here
are some to choose from
<ul>

</ul>



You will also want to use the program from last homework to calculate
orbits of the logistic equation.  This program can be found at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html</a>. <p>

And lastly you'll want the program I used in class to plot
simultaneously the orbits for two different initial conditions.  This
program can be found at:  <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/initial.conditions.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/initial.conditions.html</a>.  
 
<p><br>

<ol>
<li>By experimenting with the bifurcation diagram program, find r
values that yield orbits with the following properties.  Once you're
found the r value, check that it's behaving as you expect by using the
orbit program.  There are many possible answers to these questions.
Briefly summarize your findings.  You don't need to print out any
graphs, unless you find some that look really neat or are particularly
helpful for explaining things.  The last two might be a little 
challenging.  Give them a try, but don't worry if you can't find them.
<ol>
<li> Period 4
<li> Period 6  (Hint:  Look near period 3.)
<li> Chaotic behavior for some r not equal to 4. (There are many
possible r values to choose from.)
<li> Period 5  (Hint:  Look between 3.7 and 3.8.)
<li> Periodic behavior of some other period that's not a multiple of
2.  (Be sure to state what the period is you've found.)
</ol>

You may wish to confirm your findings by plotting the time series for
the parameter value using the orbit plotter program from last
assignment. <p>

<!--<li>For each of the four parameter values you considered above, check
and see if the system exhibits the butterfly effect.  To do so, use
the program I demonstrated in class which can be found at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/initial.conditions.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/initial.conditions.html</a>. <p>
-->

<li>On the bifurcation diagram you should notice a bunch of structures
that look like sideways pitchforks.  Zoom in on a few of them.  What
do you find?  (Just describe the what you see qualitatively -- this isn't
a technical question.)<p>

<!--<li>By zooming in on the bifurcation diagram, estimate the
"accumulation point".  This the parameter value at which the period
doubling behavior "accumulates" and turns into chaos.  For a
description of the accumulation point, see the top of page 73 of the
Gleick book.  It will probably be difficult to get more than two
decimal points accurate. <p> -->


<li> For each r value, do the following. 
  A. Determine the long-term behavior of the orbits. Are the orbits
  periodic (what period?) or chaotic?  B. Does the equation show the
  butterfly effect?  

Sketch or print out any graphs you use to draw your conclusions. 
<ol>
  <li>3.7 
  <li>3.835 
  <li>3.5699456718695445 (don't round off). 
</ol>
