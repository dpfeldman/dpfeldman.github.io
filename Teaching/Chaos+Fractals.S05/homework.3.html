<b>Homework 3:  Due Thursday 14 April at the beginning of class </b><p>

For all these problems, you will probably want to use the program at
<a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html</a>.
If you prefer, you could use a spreadsheet program or a programmable
calculator.  <p>


All of the questions below concern the logistic equation, f(x) =
rx(1-x).  You will explore what happens to orbits of f(x) for
different values of the growth rate r.  <p>

If you want, you may do this set of experiments with a partner, and
hand in only one write-up. I'm mainly interested in seeing that
you've explored the system thoroughly and made some semi-careful
observations.  This isn't meant to be a stressful ordeal.<p> 

Consider the following values for the parameter r:
<ol>
<li> r = 0.5
<li> r = 1.5
<li> r = 2.8
<li> r = 3.2
<li> r = 3.5
<li> r = 3.56
<li> r = 3.835
<li> r = 4.00
</ol>

For each of the parameter values, observe what happens to orbits of
f(x).  <b>Consider only initial populations between 0 and 1.</b> For
each parameter value, you should:
<ul>

<li> Determine the long-term behavior of the system.  Does the
population die off, reach a fixed point, or reach a periodic point?
For some parameter values you might need to plot a few thousand orbits
to see the final behavior. 
<li> Try a few different initial conditions for each parameter value.
Remember that your initial conditions should always be between 0 and
1.  You should find that overall behavior is independent of the
initial conditions you choose. 
<li>For each parameter value, make a rough sketch the general shape of
the orbit diagram.  (There's no need to print out the graph unless you
really want to.)
</ul>
