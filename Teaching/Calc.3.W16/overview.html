<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<br>
<ol>
   <li>I want to help you improve your problem solving skills, and
   mathematical confidence, and overall ability to use mathematics. 
   <li> I want you to understand and know how to use partial
   derivatives, directional derivatives, double and triple integrals,
   and their applications. 
   <li> I want you to gain experience using a computer to help you
   do mathematics. 
   <li> I want you to understand and know how to use the main elements
   of vector calculus: the divergence, gradient, and curl; line and
   surface integrals; and Greens Theorem, Stokes Theorem, and the
   Divergence Theorem. 
   <li> I want you to have fun while working hard and learning a lot. 
</ol>


<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>
William McCallum, et al. Calculus: Multivariable, 4th Edition.  J.
Wiley.  2004.  ISBN: 978-0-471-48480-6.
Note that this <b>not</b> the most current edition of the book.  On 
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/nu6ge2">amazon</a> you can get used copies
of the book for around five dollars. </p>

<p>
When ordering the book, but sure that the ISBN is correct.  The ISBN is
different for every edition of a book.  So the ISBN is the best way to
make sure that you are getting the edition and version of the book that
you want.  Note that this can be especially tricky for Calculus, as
there are many different versions of the book (multi-variable,
single-variable, etc) written by the same authors, and there are also
multiple editions of each.  Use the ISBN, however, and you can't go
wrong.
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>Your evaluation will be based on weekly homework
  assignments.  There will be to parts to these assignments: problems
  from the text that you'll put in my mailbox and problems from
  WebWorK that you'll do online. There may also be a final synthetic
  problem set or in-class exercise.  </p>

<p>I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 

<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
   <li> Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day. More than
   one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning
   this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of
   your grade. 
   <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
   can also consult me, other faculty, friends, and
   family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
   understanding. 
<!--   <li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a
   grade no higher than a C. -->
   <li> Unless students prefer otherwise, I do not plan on giving any
     exams in this class. If there is time, however, I would like to
     give a final, synthetic problem set.  Let's revisit this at the
     midterm evaluation for the course. 
   <li> You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
     trigonometry, and logarithms. There's no need to buy an expensive
     graphing calculator. 
   <li>We will be making use of WolframAlpha to help us learn and do
    math.  

  <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
    important that you check your email. 

  <li> Academic misconduct&mdash;cheating, plagarizing, etc.&mdash;is
    bad.  Any cases of academic misconduct may result in a judicial
    hearing. Possible consequences range from failure of the
    assignment to expulsion. 
<!--  <li>Here is some additional information on what is expected for
  homework solutions. -->
