<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your problem  
    solving skills and mathematical confidence.  More generally, I
    want you to leave this course with an increased ability to
    <i>do</i> mathematics.
    <li>I want you to gain a firm, enduring understanding of two of
    the big ideas of calculus: the limit and the derivative.  
    <li>I want you to be able to correctly perform
    mechanical calculations using the course content, apply problem
    solving skills to new areas, and
    effectively communicate problem solving strategies in writing. 
    <li>I want you to have fun while learning a lot.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p class="no-box"><br>
As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, fourth edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. Be sure you have the right edition of
the book.  <a href="./textbook.html">Here</a> is more information
about the text.  I would like to cover most of chapters 1-4.  
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 65 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Lab Participation:</b> 5 percent.
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.  But I also
understand that many students believe (perhaps correctly) that grades
will make it easier to get into graduate or professional school.
</p>


<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  This means they will be of
significantly less use to you on exams.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>There will be one midterm and one final exam.  Both tests will be
  open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.  You may not,
  however, get any help from any humans during the exam. 

<li> Most weeks will we have a short lab session in the Gower
  classroom. The purpose of these labs are to familiarize you with the
  computer program <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">sage</a>. You will need
  to know how to use sage in order to complete some of the homework
  assignments.  There will be short exercises that you will do during
  lab and hand in.  Mostly I will just check off that you've done the
  exercises. 

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
functions, logs, and scientific notation.  You do not need a graphing
calculator for this course. 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li> The tutors will have some regular hours, and you should also feel
  free to contact them to find a time to meet.  

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
    hearing; see the academic handbook for details.  Possible
    consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion.
