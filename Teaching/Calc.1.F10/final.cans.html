<h1>Toward a Quantitative Human Ecology of Soup Cans</h1>
</center><br><br>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>
   <li> Cylindrical soup cans are to be made to hold a fixed volume
   V. To save resources, you need would like to design a can that will
   hold V, but will use the least metal. What is the ratio of the
   radius to the height for the can that uses the least metal? (We've
   already done this problem in class.)  <br><br>

<li> Cylindrical soup cans are to be manufactured to hold a fixed volume
     V. There is no waste in cutting the metal for the sides of the
     can, but the circular endpieces will be cut from a square, with
     the corners wasted. Find the ratio of the radius to the height
     for the most economical can. Is your answer bigger or smaller
     than your answer for part 1? Explain. <br><br>

<li> Suppose that you don't need to worry about the wasted corners any
     more; you've convinced the plant operators that you should save
     the corners and remelt them and use them again. So they're not
     really wasted. However, your engineers tell you that for better
     stability, you'll need make the top and the bottom of the
     cylinder three times as thick as the sides. Find the ratio of the
     radius to the height for the can that uses the least material. Is
     your answer bigger or smaller than your answer for part 1? 
     Explain.  <br><br>

<li> Suppose you want to break with tradition and make your soup cans
     conical instead of cylindrical. Find the ratio of the radius to
     the height for the cone that holds a fixed volume V but uses the
     least material.  <br><br>

<li> Now suppose that the soup can material costs C1 per square
     centimeter. Also, assume a cost C2 per centimeter of "seam" along
     the top and bottom of the cylindrical can. Find the ratio of the
     radius to the height for the least expensive can. You will
     probably want to use sage for this. Discuss your result. Does
     the ratio change as you would expect if C1 and C2 are changed?  <br><br>

<li> <b>(Optional:)</b> You now need to build a structure to hold your
     soup cans 
     before the truck comes to take them to natural food stores and
     co-ops. Not having taken any architecture classes, you decide on
     a very simple design: a large piece of metal folded down the
     middle to form a long V. This V will then form a long triangular
     shelter for your soup cans. (To visualize this shape, take a
     piece of paper and fold it in half. Unfold it and stand it up on
     its ends.) How should you fold the metal so that your shelter
     will be able to hold the most soup cans? I.e., you want to
     maximize the volume of the building. Assume that the length of
     your metal before folding is L and the width is W. (Hint: There
     are many ways to solve this problem. I think the easiest is to
     express the volume of the structure in terms of the angle of
     folding. Then take the derivative of V with respect to this angle
     and minimize.)
