<h3>Course Overview
</h3>

I have several goals for this course.  I want you to:
<ol>
<li>Experience and participate in an introductory example of a human
ecological approach to a complex problem.
<li>Practice and improve some skills:  writing, discussing, critically
reading.
<li>Learn some stuff about inequality, economics, statistics,
political philosophy, segregation in U.S. cities, etc.
<li>Have fun while working hard and challenging our ideas.
</ol>
<p>


<b>Catalog Description:</b><br>

This interdisciplinary seminar is designed to provide students with an
introduction to human ecology.  The focus of this year's class will be
the topic of wealth.  We will take an interdisciplinary, approach to
this topic, drawing upon the work of novelists, philosophers,
political theorists, economists, artists, and others.  In so doing,
our aim is to provide a model for a human ecological approach to a
complex social phenomenon, and to give students experience in defining
and addressing a complex subject.  An additional goal of this course
is to introduce students to critical reading, writing and discussion
skills that are an essential ingredient for a student's success at
COA.  <p>

All sections of this course will begin by reading The Great Gatsby, by
F. Scott Fitzgerald.  The seminar sections will be taught separately,
although there will be several guest lecturers that will give
all-campus presentations on topics of common interest to all
sections.<p>  

This particular seminar will center on three broad questions of the
distribution of wealth.  First, to what extent are resources and
income distributed unevenly throughout the world and in various
countries and societies?  Second, do these inequalities matter?  Why
or why not?  And third, how do inequalities arise, why do they so
often persist, and how, if ever, can inequalities be ameliorated?<p> 

We will read selections from a number of current and classical
political and economic thinkers as we consider these questions.
In addition, a central component of this course will be examining
what light, if any, simple mathematical and computational models can
shed on questions of the origin of inequalities and strategies for
producing more equitable outcomes.  Computational models similar to
the ones we'll consider in the class are playing an increasingly
important role in social scientific and biological research.  In this
course students will gain a critical introduction to this style of
modeling.  One of the questions that will emerge is the extent to
which one can, or cannot, predict large-scale phenomena based on
knowledge of simple interactions or "rules of the game."  We will also
briefly discuss ethnographic and historical approaches to questions of
inequality.  <p>


Evaluation will be based on class discussion and participation,
several short papers, several problem sets, and the final
presentation.  Prerequisites:  high-school algebra.  No computer
experience is required.  Introductory.  *HE*  Lab fee $50.<p><br>


<b>Textual Materials:</b>
<ul>
<li>F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby.
<li>Barbara Ehrenreich.  Nickel and Dimed: On (not) Getting by in
America. 
<li>Many, many handouts and reserve readings.
</ul>

<p><br>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Final project:</b> 30 percent.
<li><b>Participation in class discussion and activities:</b> 30 percent.
<li><b>Short papers:</b> 20 percent
<li><b>Problem sets and other assignments:</b> 20 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I very strongly encourage students to opt out of a letter
grade.<p><br> 


<h3>Policies, Assignments, and Stuff: First Draft</h3>
<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Core_Course.03">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Core_Course.03</a>.  

<li>A more colloquial list of what to expect from this class and how
to get a lot out of is can be found <a
href="expectations.html">here</a>. 

<li> We may need to schedule an extra class or two during weeks 9 or
10 so we have enough time for the presentations.  

<li>As I plan on often sending out homework assignments and
    other information via email, it is important that you check your
    email semi-regularly. 

<li>There will be a final synthetic paper, project, and/or
presentation.  We'll discuss the details of this in a week or two.

<li>In addition to the final project, there will be a few short papers
and a few problem sets.

<li>The particular topics and sets of readings we cover toward the end
of the course is flexible and will depend on student interest and
feedback.  

<li>I expect you to attend class.   

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as
    per pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range
    from failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
