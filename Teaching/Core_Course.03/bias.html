<h2 align=center>Bias and Objectivity</h2><p>
<br>

<p><br>
Actual phrases from actual essays:

<ul>

<li>... it is not an easy task to be precise and objective about
animal behavior. 

<li> One problem with this paper is that it doesn't mention enough
details for me to know whether the authors have any inherent bias. 

<li>I also just think that a lot of this is just very subjective.

<li>This could be due to the bias of the authors.  All but one are
female.

<li>Any research based upon these essential ideals creates something
far from objectivity.

<li> ... it really seems to be a testament to the fact that cultural
biases can find their way into science, which reduces the credibility
of the objectivity that is often attributed to science. 

<li> Why, then, does this scientific paper seem to be plagued by
subjective logic and observations?  

</ul>
