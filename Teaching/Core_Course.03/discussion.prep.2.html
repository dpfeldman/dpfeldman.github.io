<h3 align=center>Preparation for Tuesday's Class (16 April 2002) </h3><p>
<br>

<p><br>

Carefully read Sue Rosser, <i>Are there feminist methodologies
Appropriate for the Natural Sciences and do they Make a
Difference?</i> in our anthology. <p>

Be prepared to discussion which "isms" are in the first Hubbard piece
we read, "Gender Ideology and the Biology of difference."  (This was
the photocopy, not the thing in the book.) <p>

Divide yourselves up into three groups.  The group should be prepared
to give a brief discussion about the following.<p>
<p><br>

<b>Group 1</b>:  Critique the LeVay article from Liberal,
African-American, and Existentialist Feminist standpoints.  (Do these
as three separate critiques, not as one big one.)  <p>

Which "isms", if any, are used in Chapter 3 of the Ziman reading?
Critique Ziman's chapter using any of the approaches from Rosser.
<p>

<p><br>
<b>Group 2</b>: Critique the LeVay article from Marxist, Essentialist,
and Psychoanalytic Feminist standpoints.  (Do these as three separate
critiques, not as one big one.)  <p> 

Which "isms", if any, are used in the National Academy of Sciences
piece in our anthology?  Critique this statement using any of the
approaches from Rosser that you feel are appropriate.<p>

<p><br>
<b>Group 3</b>: Critique the LeVay article from Lesbian Separatist,
Socialist/African-American, and Radical Feminist standpoints.  (Do
these as three separate critiques, not as one big one.)  <p> 

Which "isms", if any, are used in the Carolyn Merchant essay in our
anthology?  Critique this statement using any of the 
approaches from Rosser that you feel are appropriate.<p>
