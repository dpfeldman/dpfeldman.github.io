<h3 align=center>Preparation for Tuesday's Class (7 May 2002) </h3><p>
<br>

<p><br>

In addition to finalizing our panel discuss for Friday, we will
also spend time discussing Donna Haraway's "Situated Knowledges:  The
science question in feminism and the privilege of partial knowledge."
This is in our anthology, pp. 169-188.  This is difficult reading.  You
should read it at least twice, and probably three times.<p>

Some questions to think about while reading:
<ol>
<li>What is Haraway's (re)definition of objectivity?
<li>What does she mean by "situated knowledge?"
<li>In what ways can situated knowledge transform science?
<li>What is Haraway's vision of the interplay between politics,
culture, and science?
</ol>

<p><br>
In addition, sometime Monday you should email us with several specific
questions provoked by the reading that you'd like to discuss as a
class.
