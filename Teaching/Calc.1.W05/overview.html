<blockquote>

Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
more fun to teach than the calculus.  It is like being the ringmaster
of a great three-ring circus.  It has been said that one can recognize
the students on a college campus who have studied the calculus -- they
are the students with no eyebrows.  In utter astonishment at the
incredible applicability of the subject, the eyebrows of the calculus
students have receded higher and higher and finally vanished over the
backs of their heads.

<h3>Course Overview
</h3>



I have three main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
    solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
    <li>I want you to gain a firm understanding of two big calculus
    ideas: the limit, the derivative, and a good introduction to
    another big calculus idea: the integral.  
    <li>I want to have fun while learning a lot.
</ol>
<p>

As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, fourth edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. Be sure you have the right edition of
the book.  There should be a roller-coaster on the cover.  The ISBN
for the edition we're using is:  0-471-48482-2.  I would like to cover
all of chapters 1, 2, and 5, and parts of chapters 3 and 4.
<p><br>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based roughly on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 65 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 5 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.<p><br> 

<h3>Tutors</h3>
<ul>
<li> The following students are available for calculus help:  Eda
Kapinova, Ian Mohler, Bhupi Nagpure.
<li> The tutors will have some regular hours, and you should also feel
free to contact them to find a time to meet. 
</ul>
<p><br>

<h3>Micro-Projects</h3>
In addition to the homework, occasionally I will assign
micro-projects.  These are small, hopefully fun projects which you
will work on collaboratively in groups of threes.<p><br>


<h3>Policies and Such</h3>

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>We will need to schedule one extra class so that we end up meeting
for the full complement of twenty classes.  

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignment thoroughly.  This means they will be of
significantly less use to you on exams.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
  You may not, however, get any help from any humans during the exam.

<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading before class. 

<li>In addition to me presenting ideas and examples, there will
frequently be problems to work on in small groups in class.  Use this
time well -- it is a chance to try out some ideas and get on the right 
track before starting the homework. 

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
functions, logs, and scientific notation.  You do not need a graphing
calculator for this course. 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li>I expect you to attend class.  Missing a few classes isn't a big
deal.  Please let me know beforehand if possible.  

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the
    statements on academic 
    integrity passed by the faculty in the winter of 1999.
<li>A more informal and useful description of the course can be found

</ol>

<p><br>
<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

By your enrollment in an academic institution, you are subscribing to 
common standards of academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, 
falsifying or fabricating data, or illegally using artwork of others is 
a breach of such standards and is unacceptable. Students and faculty 
share responsibility to clarify conventions of attribution, so
that no one uses words or works of others, including artwork, 
without proper acknowledgment. If you do not understand or have 
questions about what
constitutes ethical scholarship, ask that the issue be discussed in 
class. Cases of academic dishonesty may be resolved between student 
and teacher or, at the discretion of either party, may be referred to 
a judiciary hearing coordinated by an Academic Dean. Consequences for
violations may range from losing credit for an assignment or course up 
to suspension or expulsion from COA. <p><br>


<h4>Academic Misconduct</h4>

Academic misconduct is a breach of common standards of academic honesty as 
well as a breach of any particular instructions provided by a professor 
in a given class. Examples include cheating, plagiarism, or any other form 
of using the work of another person without proper acknowledgment. Another
example of academic misconduct is the deliberate removal of library books 
or of essential reference or reserve material; this aspect also includes
monopolizing or abusing resources other students need to complete academic
projects. Cases of academic misconduct may be resolved between student and
teacher or, at the discretion of either party, may be referred to a 
judiciary hearing coordinated by an Academic Dean. Consequences for 
violations may range from losing credit for an assignment or course up to
suspension or expulsion from COA. <p><br>
