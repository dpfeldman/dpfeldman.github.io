<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 21 January, 2005</b>.<p>
For most of the exercises (as opposed to the problems) not much in the
way of an explanation is necessary.  You should, however, show your
work. <p>

For a few of these problems, the textbook asks you to not
use a calculator or a computer.  It's ok with me if you use one; the
important thing is to explain what the clues are that tell you which
graph is which.<p>

<b>Maple Problem:</b>
<ol>
<li>Consider the following two functions:  f(x) = sin(100x) and g(x) =
sin(101x).  Plot the function f(x)+g(x).  Explore different plotting
scales.  Explain why the graph looks the way it does.  If you're
stuck, you might want to ask someone who has experience playing a
stringed instrument.
