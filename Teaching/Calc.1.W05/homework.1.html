<b>Homework 1:  Due Friday 14 January, 2005 </b><p> For many of the
problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it still
might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning.<p> 
<br>

<b>Autobiography:</b>  Write a brief paragraph (or send me an email)
describing the math classes you've taken previously.  Be sure to
indicate where you took those classes: high school, COA, another
college.  Feel free to mention any other information about your math
background that might be relevant, interesting, and/or amusing.  This
can be as long or as short as you want.<p> 

<b>Chapter 1.1:</b>
<ol>
<li>2. 
<li>5. 
<li>9.
<li>10. No explanations necessary. 
<li>17. No explanations necessary. 
<li>18.
<li>22-24. No explanations necessary. 
<li>25.  No explanations necessary. 
<li>27.  No explanations necessary.  (Be careful -- this one is
slightly trickey.)
<li>29.
<li>36. 
</ol><p>

<b>Chapter 1.2:</b>
<ol>
<li>1-4. No explanations necessary.
<li>6.
<li>11.  No explanations necessary.
<li>13.
<li>15.
<li>19.
<li>32.
<li>36.
</ol>
<p>


<b>Computer Problem:</b>
Maple should be on the desktop of all PCs in the computer
labs.  Double click on the icon and, after a little bit of whirring, a
maple icon will appear.  Maple commands are fairly intuitive, but they
do take a little getting used to.  Maple has some pretty good built-in
tutorials.  A decent tutorial on plotting with maple can be found <a
href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~meade/math242/maple/day19.html#MapleAutoBookmark9">here</a>;
ignore the stuff about putting titles on plots, though.  For Maple
help from a real live human, talk to one of the teaching assistants or 
me.  I also
recommend looking at the page of <a href="../../Maple/">Maple Help</a>
that I've put together. <p> 
<ol>
<li>Use Maple to plot f(x) = 4x^2, and then print out the plot.
(Hint, Maple doesn't understand 4x^2, but it does understand 4*x^2.)
<li>Use Maple to plot a cool function, and then print out the plot.
Be sure to say why you think the function is cool.
</ol>
