<h1 align=center> Intro to Chaos and Fractals:  Final Papers</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

<b>The final paper is due on the last day of class.</b><p>

<b>For a list of possible paper topics, <a

<h3>Length</h3>

Your paper should be around 4-5 pages.  Try to write concisely.  A
shorter, concise paper is much better than a longer, rambling one.
<p><br> 

<h3>Audience</h3>
For all papers, assume that your audience is a reasonably educated
person who doesn't know much about chaos or fractals.  

<p><br>

<h3>Terms to Define</h3>

Since your audience is non-technical, if you use any of the following
terms, you'll need to define them.  It's best to define them in your
own words.  If you can't, be sure to give citations.  Also, for many
of these, you'll need to do more than define just one word.  For
example, it might be hard to define chaos without also defining and/or
giving an example of a dynamical system.
