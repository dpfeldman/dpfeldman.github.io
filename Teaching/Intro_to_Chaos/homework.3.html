<b>Homework 3:  Due Friday 28 January  </b><p>

<b>Problems from Devaney</b>
<ol>
<li>Exercise 44, p. 22.  Be sure to consider what happens to <i>all</i> 
possible initial conditions. 
<li>Exercise 3.1, p. 43.
</ol>
<br>

<b>Computer Problems.</b>  <b>Please be sure to do these before class
on Friday!!!</b> For all these problems, you will probably want to use the
program at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html</a>. 
All of the questions below concern the logistic equation, f(x) =
rx(1-x).  You will explore what happens to orbits of f(x) for
different values of the growth rate r.  If you want, you may do this
set of experiments with a partner, and hand in only one write-up.
Think of this as more of a "lab report" than a normal math assignment
with a bunch of right answers.  I'm mainly interested in seeing that
you've explored the system thoroughly and made some thoughtful and
careful observations.  
<ol>
<li>For all of the following values of r, figure out as best you can
what happens to iterates of f(x) with initial conditions between 0
and 1.  
<ol>
<li> r = 0.5
<li> r = 1.5
<li> r = 2.5
<li> r = 3.2
<li> r = 3.49
<li> r = 3.55
<li> r = 3.83
<li> r = 4.00
</ol>
<li>  For all of the above parameters discuss the behavior you see for
initial conditions between 0 and 1.  Is the system periodic?  Can you
concoct a simple (one or two sentence) story about the population of
rabbits on an island?  
</ol>
