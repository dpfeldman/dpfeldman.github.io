<h1 align=center>Julia Set "Show and Tell"</h1><p>
<p>
<br>


Working with zero, one, or two other students, do the following.  
You will present your Julia Set <b>during class on Tuesday 7
March.</b> 

<ol>

<li> Go to <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/FLAOH/cbnhtml/javalarge.html">this web
site</a>.  After a slight delay, a java applet will appear on your
screen.  There will be a menu on the upper right part of your
browser's screen.  Choose "The Julia Set".<p>

<li>  You now should have a screen that looks similar to those that I
showed you in class on Tuesday.  Explore different Julia sets.  To do
so, change the c value.   These are the 7th and 8th input boxes on the
right part of the screen.  After inputting new values, press "restart"
and the new julia set will appear.  Depending on your computer, this
may take between 5 and 30 seconds.  <p>

<li>Experiment until you find a Julia set that you really like.  You
can zoom in on a Julia set by using your mouse to highlight the area
you'd like enlarged.  After highlighting, press restart and the new
image should appear.<p>

<li>Once you choose a Julia set, prepare a short (2-3 minute)
presentation about it.  Your presentation should include the
following: 

<ol>
<li> A copy of the Julia set on an overhead transparancy.  Make the
overhead using the library copy machines; charge the copies and the
transparancy to my course budget. 
<li>The c value that you used to make your Julia set.
<li>A name for the Julia Set -- be creative!
<li>If you wish, include a few overheads showing what the Julia set
looks like as you zoom in on some portion of it. 
</ol>
