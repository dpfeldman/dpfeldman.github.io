<b>Homework 4:  Due Tuesday 1 February at the beginning of class </b>
As on the previous assignment, you can work in pairs and hand in only
one set of answers if you want.<p>


To answer these questions, you'll need to use a program to make
bifurcation diagrams.  Such a program can be found at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/bifurcation.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/bifurcation.html</a>.
If you don't like my program or it's running too slow or you just want
to try something different, you could check out a java applet that's
available <a
href="http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/applets/OrbitDiagram.html">here</a>
on the web page of Bob Devaney's research group. The java applet
basically does the same thing as the program on my website.  If you
have a slow connection but a reasonably fast computer, the applet may
be the choice for you.<p>

<b>Important Note:</b> After you run the program, please don't hit the
"back" key on your browser.  Instead, go to the bottom of the page and
select "start over".  When you run the programs, a temporary data file
is stored on my computer.  If you click on "start over" then this data
file gets erased.  If you hit back, the data file doesn't get erased.
It's possible (although unlikely) that all these temporary
data files could accumulate and fill up my hard drive.<p>


You may also wish to use the program from last homework to calculate
orbits of the logistic equation.  This program can be found at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html</a>. 
<p><br>

<ol>
<li>By experimenting with the bifurcation diagram program, find r
values that yield orbits with the following properties.  Once you're
found the r value, check that it's behaving as you expect by using the
orbit program.  There are many possible answers to these questions.
Briefly summarize your findings.  You don't need to print out any
graphs, unless you find some that look really neat or are particularly
helpful for explaining things.  The last two might be somewhat
challenging.  Give them a try, but don't worry if you can't find them.
<ol>
<li> Period 4
<li> Period 6  (Hint:  Look near period 3.)
<li> Chaotic behavior for some r not equal to 4.  Are there any ranges
of r for which the behavior appears chaotic, or do you just see chaos
for isolated r values.
<li> Period 32
<li> Period 5
</ol>
<li>On the bifurcation diagram you should notice a bunch of structures
that look like sideways pitchforks.  Zoom in on a few of them.  What
do you find?  
<li>By zooming in on the bifurcation diagram, estimate the
"accumulation point".  For a description of the accumulation point,
see the top of page 73 of the Gleick book.  It will probably be
difficult to get more than two decimal points accurate.
