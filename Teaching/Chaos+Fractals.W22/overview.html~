<blockquote>
      I would...urge that people be introduced to [chaos] early in
      their mathematical education. [Chaos] can be studied
      phenomenologically by iterating it on a calculator, or even by
      hand. Its study does not involve as much conceptual
      sophistication as does elementary calculus. Such study would
      greatly enrich the student's intuition. Not only in research,
      but also in the everyday world of politics and economics, we
      would all be better off if more people realised that simple
      nonlinear systems do not necessarily possess simple dynamical
      properties.

</p>

<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ol>
    <li>Stay physically and mentally healthy and maintain intellectual
      and personal connection during a potentially difficult
      time.</li>
    <li>I want you to gain a solid understanding of the basic
      mathematical ideas behind chaos and fractals. As part of this, I
      hope you'll leave this course thinking somewhat differently
      about order and disorder, simplicity and complexity.</li>
    <li>I want to help you improve your basic facility with algebra
      and functions, your problem solving skills, your ability to create
      and interpret different types of graphs, and your overall
      mathematical confidence.</li>
    <li>I want you to gain a sense of how math and physics is done, and
      gain an awareness that these are not static, "dead" disciplines. I
      want you to gain a greater understanding of science as an
      institution and science as a culture, and how science intersects
      and influences other creative and scholarly areas.</li>
    <li>Have fun while growing and learning. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Texts</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li><i>Chaos: Making a New
Science</i> by <a href="http://www.around.com/">James Gleick</a>.
This is a popular science book and is not a traditional text.  I have
  around a dozen copies I can loan out.</li>

<li><a href="http://chaos.coa.edu"><i>Chaos and Fractals: An Elementary
  Introduction</i></a>, David Feldman</a>, Oxford University Press,
  2012.  I'd suggest checking out the list
  of <a href="http://chaos.coa.edu/errata.html">errata</a>.  Multiple
  copies will be on reserve on the library.</li>

<li>We'll also read a few short papers, and quite likely a short story
  and some poetry.  The exact assignments will depend on the interests
  of the class. 
</ol>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 25 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation/Engagement:</b> 10 percent.
<li><b>Short Writing and Responses:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

<p class="no-box">In general, I recommend against grades; I believe
they are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
learning.  This is especially true in this class, where I have found
that many of the class activities <i>really</i> don't lend themselves to
letter grading. I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc. </p> 
  

<h3>Course Structure and Flow</h3>

<p>This is the seventeenth(!) time I've taught this course, so on the
  one hand I have a very good feel for how this will go. But we are
  still in a pandemic, so nothing it quite normal.</p>

<ul>

<li>This course is somewhat difficult to describe. I think the most
  important pre-requisite is to approach the material with an open
  mind and a sense of exploration and adventure. With a little
  intellectual initiative I think you will find many opportunities to
  make connections between the material of this course and other
  interests of yours. </li> 

  <li>There are some aspects of this class that are new this time
  around: 
  <ul>
    <li>This class is larger than I've ever taught it before. I am
      trying a large class since I think there is strong student
      demand for the course and there is a large room in the new
      building that should work well.</li>
    <li>There will be two smaller discussions sections/labs that will
      allow us to do some more interactive labs and investigations and
      also discuss some readings.</li>
    <li>I'm also using electronic WeBWorK homework for the first time
      in this class. I've used WeBWorK before in many other classes,
      and I'm confident it will work well in this class, but there may
      be a few bumps in the road.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>In many traditional math classes the instructor shows you how to
  do a bunch of problems, you go home and obediently practice the
  stuff your instructor showed you, and then you take a test. This
  class will not be like that. There will be some traditional-style
  homework, but there will be many other exercises too.</li>

<li>Some of the homework assignments are more like laboratory
  exercises. That is, rather than doing a quick problem and getting a
  simple answer, I'll ask you to explore some stuff, make
  observations, and look for patterns. Frequently these assignments
  will have open-ended questions. You will enjoy these assignments
  more if you approach them as you would a good laboratory exercise in
  a science class.</li>   

<li>We will do a wide variety of things in the discussion sections,
  including some hands-on exercises and explorations.</li>

<li>This class is not a systematic review of algebra or trigonometry;
  it is not explicitly designed to prepare you for further math
  classes. Nevertheless, you will review and strengthen your
  understanding of algebra and functions by taking this course.</li>

<li>The material we'll be reading about in Gleick's book, and the work
  we'll do in my book and in class will shift in and out of phase with
  each other. The two books don't cover the same topics in the same
  order. In the past this hasn't been a problem; it's just something
  to be aware of.</li>

<li>In terms of the math stuff we'll be doing, it will take a few
  weeks to get to the chaos material. Before we do, what we're doing
  might seem odd. The initial exercises we do might seem boring or
  irrelevant, but this phase of the course is essential groundwork for
  what's to follow.</li>

<li>There will frequently be readings or exercises assigned for
  class. When this is the case, you should read carefully and be ready
  to discuss and share ideas and questions.</li>

<li>
</ul>

<h3>Some Details and Logistics</h3>

<p><ol>
  <li>This class fulfills both the <b>ES</b> and the <b>QR</b>
    requirements. At the same time.</li>
  <li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day. If
    you need extra time on the assignments, that's fine, but please
    let me know.</li>
  <li>You will do some short writing for this class in addition to
    problem sets.</li>
  <li>You will also do a final project.  If you wish, you can
  collaborate with other students. Projects take a wide variety of
  forms and can be on almost any topic related to the course material.</li>
</ol></p>


<!--<h3>Class Meetings</h3>
<p><ol>
  <li>This class meets three times a week on zoom. Class sessions will
    vary in length but will almost never be more than an hour.</li>
  <li>Video stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>As much as possible, please keep your video turned on during
	class. This will help you stay engaged and will help me have a
	sense of how class is going. I have been teaching a long time
	and am generally good at gauging whether or not a class is
	following what I'm teaching.  But I won't be able to do this if
	I'm looking at a screen full of black rectangles.</li> 
      <li>Of course if you have connection problems or if you need to turn
	the camera off for a few minutes, that's fine.</li>
      <li>It's ok to wear pajamas to class. </li>
      <li>Pets are welcome to join in. Especially cats.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>I plan on turning on zoom at 9:30 but not starting class until
    9:45.  Please feel free to come early and hang out.  Some days I
    might still be getting ready for class.  Some days I might play some
    music (which you can mute if you don't like).  Other days I'll be
    available to chat.  Most days class will end around 10:45, but I'll
    keep zoom open until around 11:00 in case people have questions,
    want to talk, etc.</li>    
  <li>I strongly encourage you to take handwritten notes.  The
    physical component of taking notes helps to keep you engaged.  And
    taking handwritten notes requires you to do some on-the-fly
    synthesis and prioritization, deepening your understanding.</li>
  <li>During class there will frequently be times where you will work
    in small groups on problems. Figuring out the best way to do this
    on Zoom might take some trial and error.</li>
</ol>
</p>
-->


<h3>Homework!</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    math, and also this is most of what
    your evaluation will be based on.</li>
  <li>As discussed in <a href="https://youtu.be/iteUqErz2jU">this
  video</a> there will be two parts to almost every homework
    assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	google classroom</li>
    </ol>
  <li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. I use this system even
    when the world is not in a global pandemic.  There are three reasons 
    why I use WeBWorK:
    <ol>
      <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	many times until you get everything correct.</li>
      <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	final answer. </li>
      <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	grading.</li>
      </ol></li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I expect the homework assignments to be productively
    challenging. The assignments will vary in length, difficulty, and
    style. I don't expect you to be able to complete the homework
    quickly in one sitting.  Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I
    strongly suggest working with others and seeking help if you need
    it.</li> 
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email classroom, it is important that you
    check your email regularly.</li>
  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a basic calculator or 
    phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
    not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
    ever). </li>
  </ol>
  
</p>


<h3>Help Sessions</h3>
<p>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions
every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
Things that happen at help sessions: 
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
    specific questions.</li>
<!--  <li>We can experiment with breakout rooms for folks who want to work
  together in small groups during the help session.</li>-->
<!--  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.-->
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>You should also feel free to reach out to me and the Teaching
  Assistants with questions. If you're stuck on a problem, it might
  help to take a photo of what you've done so far and include it in an
  email to us. We might be able to help you with a short email, or we
  could set up a time to meet, perhaps on zoom.</p>

<p>Also, you can summon help via email from within WeBWorK.  If you do
  so, I get an email and a link to your version of the WeBWorK
  problem, and I can see all the answers you've submitted.  Usually I
  can see what's going on and quickly offer some help.  Sometimes
  it'll be an issue that doesn't lend itself to email, in which case
  we find a time to meet and go over it.</p>
      

<h3>Electronic Distractions</h3>
<p>
As much as possible, I'd like to minimize the use of laptops, tablets,
and phones during our class meetings.  There is good evidence that
these wonderful devices can harm the learning environment, even
for those who are not using their own devices and are merely exposed
to the devices of others.  An excellent, reasoned discussion of this
is 
<a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.vg0jdax0x">Why
  I Just Asked My Students To Put Their Laptops Away</a>
  by <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>.  I highly
  recommend giving his essay a read.</p>

<p class="no-box">There is no need to ban laptops entirely&mdash;that
  just seems 
  silly to me.  There will be times in class when we will do exercises
  that require computers, and there will also be moments when we might
  want to grab a device and look up the meaning of a word or a
  historical tidbit or something.  So let's use common sense and keep
  devices holstered except when they're needed, at which point we
  should use them proudly and without apology.</p>


<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown.
</p>



<h3>Discussions</h3>
<p class="no-box">
We will do a lot of different things during class meetings, including
discussing readings.  These discussions are chance for us to explore
some of the philosophical, conceptual, historical, and social aspects
of chaos and fractals.  The readings we do will range widely in
content, style, and difficulty. There are several goals and
motivations I have for discussions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The discussions are a chance to figure out some things
    together. We will be doing some readings that are sometimes
    difficult and subtle and, I hope, interesting. Working together we
    can solidify and deepen our understanding. 
  <li> In some of the discussions it will be particularly valuable to
    hear a diversity of opinions. I expect there will be a range of
    reactions and responses to some of what we read, and I think that
    there is tremendous value to listening to and engaging with a
    diversity of thought. 
<!--  <li> Discussion meetings are also a chance to demonstrate to me that
    you are engaged with the material. More on this below.-->
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
Expectations for class discussions:
<ul>
  <li> Prepare. Do the reading and think about it. Expect to spend an
    hour or two preparing, although obviously this will vary a lot
    from reading to reading. Take notes, write down questions, and 
    prepare responses to any questions I might have posed.
  <li> If you can work with a hard copy of the reading. I think it is
    easier to engage with a text via a physical copy, and as much as
    possible I don't want us to have laptops open when we meet. 
  <li> Be present. Listen to others, respond, and contribute your own
  ideas and questions. 
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
We should all work to create an inviting atmosphere and ensure that
there is opportunity for all to contribute. At the same time, there is
no need for everybody to contribute equally. It is natural for some
people to talk more than others, and I think this is normal and
good. Also, I expect that students will engage and contribute at
different levels, depending on prior coursework. I see this diversity
of backgrounds as a strength and not a weakness; there are roles for
everyone to play. Asking good questions is as important as providing
answers. </p>

<p class="no-box">
Finally, it goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: the point of
discussions is not to figure out who is right and who is wrong, but to
help all of us get to a deeper, and not necessarily uniform,
understanding.  
</p>

  

<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 4.5 hr/wk "in" class,
      2 hr/wk reading, 8.5 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
