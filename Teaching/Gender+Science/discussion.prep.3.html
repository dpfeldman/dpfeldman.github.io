<h3 align=center>Preparation for Friday's Class (19 April 2002) </h3><p>
<br>

<p><br>

In your groups, find around five different written (or graphic)
instances of science being discussed.  Possibilities for this
include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Science textbooks.
<li>Books about teaching science (at different grade levels).
<li>Science discussed in a newspaper.
<li>Government Science Organizations (e.g., National Science
Foundation, National Institute of Health, Office of Naval Research,
Department of Defense.)
<li>Corporations and R+D labs.
<li>Movies, Fiction, Music.
</ul>
Be creative in the sources you find!  At least one should be from a
source outside the U.S.  Examples in languages other than English are
fine, but be prepared to provide a rough translation.  <p>


You should prepare a handout (make enough copies for everyone in the
class) that includes:
<ol>

<li>The text or image, indicating where you got it from.

<li>A brief discussion of <i>how</i> science is being used or referred
to.  (Instrumental, social construct, epistemic category, etc. )

<li>For what ends do you think science is being used in this instance
in this way?  Who is the intended audience?

</ol>

There's no need to write tons; we'll discuss these in detail in class
on Friday.
