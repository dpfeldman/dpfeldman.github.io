<h3 align=center>Preparation for Discussions on <i>Has Feminism
Changed Science?</i> by Londa Schiebinger </h3><p>
<br>

<p><br>

<b>Wednesday, 24 April:</b><p>
All should read the introduction, and up to and including Chapter 5.
In your groups, prepare to lead a short discussion on the chapters
assigned to you.  To do so, you should
<ul>
<li>Prepare a written summary of the chapter.  An outline or a few
sentences per section is fine.
<li>Compile a list of questions you'd like to ask the scientists
who'll be coming to our panel week 6.
<li>Identify two or three key issues or open questions around which
you'll lead the class in discussion.
</ul>

Breakdown of chapter assignments:
<ol>
<li>Intro, Chapter 5
<li>Chapter 1, Chapter 3
<li>Chapter 2
</ol>
Suzanne and I will prepare stuff for Chapter 4.  




<p><br>


<b>Friday, 26 April:</b><p>
Everyone should read the conclusion.  Depending on which group you're
assigned, you should read the appropriate chapter, and prepare for
discussion as you did for Wednesday.


<ol>

<li>Chapter 6: Medicine

<li>Chapter 9:  Physics and Math

<li>Chapter 7+8:  Primatology, Archaeology, and Human Origins, and
Biology 

</ol>

We'd be happy to meet with any of the groups and help summarize and
prepare for discussion.
