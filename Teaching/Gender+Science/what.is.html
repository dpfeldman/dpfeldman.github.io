<p><br>
<b>Due at the beginning of class on Friday 5 April.</b><p>

Write a few paragraphs on each of the following questions:
<ol>
<li>What is science?
<li>What is gender?
<li>Speculate on the interrelationships between science and
gender? 
</ol>

Do not consult any references.  You will not be evaluated on this
version of this assignment.  We will be returning to these questions
frequently in the course.  The goal of this assignment is to record
your initial thoughts on these questions.  Later in the term you will
revisit your response, as a way for you to see how your thoughts on
these questions have evolved. <p>   

Your response should be between two and four pages.  Please type,
spell-check, and proofread.  <p>

<b>Also</b>, come to class with several written questions that
occurred to you while you were completing this exercise.
