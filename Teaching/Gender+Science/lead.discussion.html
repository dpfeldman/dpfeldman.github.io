<h2 align=center>Guidelines for leading discussion</h2><p> 
<br>

<b></b><p>


You should choose a topic and be prepared to lead a class discussion
on it.   
<ul>
<li>Please clear your topic with Suzanne or Dave.
<li>To prepare, you should read at a bare minimum three articles or
book chapters on the topic.  (You should discuss your reading list
with us.)
<li>Choose a reading that the class will do.  If this reading isn't in
our reader, put it on reserve enough in advance so that others can
read it.  This reading should be about twenty pages. 
<li>Use the common reading as a basis for discussion.  However, you
should be prepared to bring in additional information and ideas from the
other reading you did. 

<li>You should plan on your discussion lasting around 40 minutes.  

<li>You should also prepare and hand in to us an annotated
bibliography. 

</ul>
