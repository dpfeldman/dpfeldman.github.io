<h2 align=center>Final Exercise</h2><p> 
<br>

<b>Due at 5:30pm on the last day of the term.</b><p>


The purpose of this exercise is for you to reflect on your initial
ideas about gender, science, and their interrelationship.  We could
like you to re-read your first essay and critique, respond to, and
expand upon, your initial comments.  In so doing, you should build
upon the readings and discussions we've had this term; be sure to
refer to at least three of the readings we've done. <p>

We'd like you to re-read your essay and re-read and reflect upon some
of the readings we've done.  However, <b>you should spend only three
hours in writing your response</b>.  You may have a writing tutor look
over your writing if you wish.  We encourage you to discuss your ideas
with others while you're preparing the essay.  You final essay must be
typed and attached to your original essay.  Please put the essays in
Dave's mailbox. <p> 

If you have any questions or concerns about this assignment, please
contact us.
