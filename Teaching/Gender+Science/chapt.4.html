<h3 align=center><i>Has Feminism Changed Science?</i> by Londa
Schiebinger </h3><p> 
<h3 align=center>Chapter 4:  Clash of Cultures </h3><p>
<br>

<p><br>
<b>Central Premises</b><p>
<ul>

<li> The tension underlying the clashing cultures is that between the
division private and public.

<li>There are many aspects of scientific culture(s) that tend to
alienate women.

</ul>

<ol>
<li>The Gendering of Science
<ul>
<li>A root of the clash of cultures is the notion of <i>Sexual
Complementarity</i>:  Women are not equals, but complementary
opposites to men.   

<li>"The ideal virtues of femininity --- required for the joys of domestic
life --- [are] portrayed [within the culture of science] as a personal 
failing of women."

</ul>


<li>What's in an image?
<ul>
<li>Most images people see and people internalize of science and
scientists are masculine, socially dysfunctional, and male.

<li>Physical appearances are another realm in which these cultures
clash.  

<li>"Women successful in science often assimilate or are assimilated to
masculine codes of honor."
</ul>


<li>Women in Professional Culture
<ul>

<li>"Men and women fall easily into expected and comfortable behaviors
which may unintentionally perpetuate women's subordinate stature."

<li>Gender asymmetries influence student evaluations.

</ul>
<li>Competition, Science, and Sports
<ul>
<li>Science is very competitive and modeled after a sports team.  This
is particularly true in the U.S. 
<li>There is a widespread belief that science is pushed forward most
efficiently by competition between labs and scientists.
</ul>

</ol>
