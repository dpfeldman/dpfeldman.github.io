<br>



<b>Iteration</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Start with a seed, repeatedly apply a function.  This is an
example of a feedback loop.  <p>

<li>In homework and in class, we iterated functions numerically (using
a calculator or by hand) and by making graphically iterating via
<i>cobweb diagrams</i>.  <p>


<li>Vocabulary to describe the results of iteration:
<ul>
<li><i>Orbit</i>:  The sequence of values obtained while iterating.
Also known as an <i>itinerary</i>.<p>
<li><i>Fixed Point</i>:  A number which, when the function is applied
to it, remains unchanged.  The <i>fixed point equation</i> is f(x) =
x. <p>
<li><i>Periodic Point</i>:  A number which, when the function is
applied to it, returns to itself after N iterations.  The number N is
known as the <i>periodicity</i>.<p>
<li> A fixed point is <i>attracting</i> if nearby points are drawn
closer to it under iteration.<p>
<li> A fixed point is <i>repelling</i> if nearby points are pushed
away from it under iteration.<p>
<li> Attracting fixed points or periodic cycles are also called
<i>stable</i>. <p>
<li> Repelling fixed points or periodic cycles are also called
<i>unstable</i>. <p>

<li> If successive numbers in the orbit get larger and larger, then we
say that <i>the orbit tends to infinity</i>.<p><br>

</ul>
</ul>


<b>Logistic Equation</b>

<ul>
<li>Simplest <i>model</i> of population growth that doesn't assume
unlimited growth and an unbounded population.  <p>

<li>Iterated the logistic equation, f(x) = rx(1-x).  The variable r is
viewed as a <i>parameter</i>.  The population x is a number between 0
and 1; think of it as a fraction of the maximum possible
population.<p> 

<li>Experimented with different values of the parameter.  We saw that
<i>bifurcations</i> occurred as r was varied.  A bifurcation is a
sudden change in the fate of an orbit as a parameter is varied.<p>

<li>We summarized the behavior of the logistic equation by using a
<i>final state diagram</i>.  This type of diagram is also known as a
<i>bifurcation diagram</i>.<p>

<li>The bifurcation diagram showed an intricate structure.  For
different values of r there were all sorts of periodic behavior as
well as lots of values for which r was chaotic.<p>
<br>

</ul>

<b>Types of Graphs</b>

<ul>
<li>Orbit Diagram
<li>Graphical Iteration aka Cobweb Diagram
<li>Parameter Plane
<li>Final-State Diagram aka Bifurcation Diagram
</ul>
<p><br>


<b>Chaos</b>
<ul>
<li>A system is <i>chaotic</i> if:
<ul>
  <li>The orbit is bounded (i.e. it doesn't fly off to infinity) and it
    never repeats.<p>
  <li>The system displays <i>Sensitive Dependence on Initial
    Conditions</i>.   <p>
</ul>
<li>The above two criteria are equivalent, in the sense that one implies
the other, and vice versa.<p>
<li>A system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions -- also 
known as the butterfly effect -- if small differences in initial
conditions are quickly magnified.<p><br>
</ul>

<b>Big Ideas</b>
<ul>
<li>A simple deterministic system can produce unpredictable
results.<p> 
<li>A simple deterministic system can produce complicated, ordered
behavior, e.g. period 32 or period 17 cycles. <p>

</ul>
