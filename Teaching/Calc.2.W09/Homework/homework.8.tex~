\item Two trains are 100 km apart.  At noon, they start moving
 directly toward each other at a speed of 10 m/s.  Eventually, they
 crash.  Initially, a bird is sitting on one of the trains.  At noon,
 the bird flies directly toward the other train at 20m/s.  As soon as
 it reaches the train, it turns around and heads to the other train.
 As soon as it reaches this train, it again turns around and heads
 toward the other one, and so on, traveling at 20 m/s all the while.
 The bird zigs and zags back and forth between the two trains.
 Eventually, when the trains crash, the bird is crushed, too.  How
 far did the bird travel?
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Do this problem the easy way.
   \item Do this problem the hard way, by expressing the distance
   traveled as a geometric series and summing the series.
\end{enumerate}
