  <p>it's kinda obvious from the course title, but here's what i hope you 
     learn in this course</b>
  <h2>Course Goals</h2>
</header>

<ol> 
<li>I want you to gain a basic, enduring understanding of the core elements of Python.
<li>I want to work toward developing a careful, systematic, and effective 
programming style.
<li>I want you to learn about a number of ways that programming is
  used to solve different sorts of scientific problems.
<li>I want you to gain experience creating, implementing, and testing programs.
<!--algorithms and be able to apply algorithmic thinking and programming skills to areas of your interest.-->
<li>I want you to experience the challenge and excitement of creating and 
  implementing your own programs.
<!--<li>I want you to gain an awareness of the range and scope of problems that computer scientists and programmer work on, and some of the big issues in these fields.-->
<li>I want you to leave this course with the background and skills to further 
  your working knowledge of Python and other programming languages. 

</ol>



<header class="align-center">
  <p>some thoughts on why you might want to learn to code, although you
     probably already know that programming is awesome</b>
  <h2>Why Code?</h2>
</header>

<ul>

<li>Programming is useful.  Some basic programming skills are useful
in almost any field of science, and the necessity of knowing
programming will almost surely increase over time.  Almost everyone I
know doing good and interesting research in math or physics has at
good (or better) programming skills.
Programming is
also very useful for some areas of the social sciences and increasingly
in the humanities and arts.  
<!--Also, if you anticipate working
in any sort of IT field (databases, web page design and management,
system administration), knowing some basic programming will be very
valuable.-->

<li> Programming is an act of creation.  A successful program involves
thinking up something and making it real.  The result is a thing that
works and is useful.  In this sense programming is much closer to
engineering or art than it is to science.  <!--Programing is used in
science, but the act of programming itself is not a science. -->

<li>Computer science teaches problem solving.  At its core, computer
science is the study of algorithms: methods of solving problems which
can be automated.  This study prepares students to solve all sorts of
problems, not just those involving computers.  The structured study of
algorithms also positions students to more fully understand the
limitations associated with algorithmic methods. 

<li>There is a tremendous value to the intellectual discipline
demanded by programming.  Successful programming takes patience,
practice, organization, and a tremendous attention to detail.  Good
programmers must simultaneously have a sense of the big (or at least
medium) picture about the problem they're trying to solve and also
have mastered a considerable body of detailed technical information.
This combination of skills will help students in many different
endeavors.  Also, I think the attention to detail required in
programming is something that you're not likely to encounter in many
other COA classes.  

<li>Programming is fun.  The challenge of designing and implementing
an algorithm is exciting.  There is a great satisfaction associated
with coming up with an idea and then making it work.  Also, the focus
demanded by programming is, for many, very healthy and almost
therapeutic. 

<li>Programmers are fun.  My experience has been that programmers are
a very interesting and intellectually diverse lot.<br><br>

</ul>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>some musings on how to learn how to code and also some general 
     ruminations on this course</b>
  <h2>How to learn Programming</h2>
</header>

<ul>
<li> The only way to learn programming is to do it.  A lot.  I suppose
that this is true about learning just about anything.  But it seems
somehow more true for programming than some other areas. 

<li>I think that a key to meeting the goals of this course is to start
  fast.  I want to dive right in and have you do a lot of basic
  programming in the first few weeks. 

<!--<li>I have never taken a programming class.  I learned C++ mostly on
my own, but had help from some friends and colleagues who are very
good programmers.  I have been coding in C++ since 1995, have used it
extensively in my research, and have taught a class and several
tutorials in C++.  I do not consider myself to be an expert
programmer, although I am certainly not a beginner, either.  I am
relatively new to python and am still learning some of the details
of the language. -->

<!--<li> I will use class time to explain general concepts and some
particularly tricky or subtle aspects of coding.  Sometimes I will do
  an example on the screen and then you will spend time modifying the
  code and trying it out on your own.  However, my aim will be to
  complement the 
text and not duplicate it.  It will be essential for you to spend a
fair amount of time thoughtfully reading the book.  I think the book
is well written and is almost always quite clear. -->

<li>This class likely will be a lot of work at times.  It is difficult
to estimate how long it takes to complete a programming
exercise.  This is the nature of programming.  Sometimes a program
works on the first try.  Other times it may take days.  Learning to
struggle and cope with this is part of the course. 

<li>Particularly at first, you won't understand everything.  I think
the best thing to do is to blast ahead anyway.  When learning a spoken
language, it is inevitable that you'll have to use grammatical
constructions that at first you don't understand.  Only after you've
learned quite a few things does the logic of the language come into
view.  I think learning a programming language is similar.  Don't feel
like you have to be perfectly comfortable with one chapter before
going on to the next. 

<li>If you're not keen on python, don't worry.  Once you know one
language it is relatively easy to pick up an additional language.
(Learning to program isn't the same thing as learning a particular
language.)

<li>Some of the programming exercises might be a little tedious.  But
this tedium should pay off; you'll gain skills and have working code
that you can use and re-use.
<!--It will be a while before you'll be able to code up anything really
interesting or new.  I don't think there is any way around this.
However, by the end of the course you will be able to write your
own, reasonably complex original programs.  You should have a fairly
large number of working programs that you can use as templates and
starting points for other programs that you might want to write in the
future.-->

<li>A key goal of this class is to develop an organized, clear style.
Having a well put together piece of code is more important than
just getting the thing to work.  A poorly constructed program may work
once, if you're lucky, but will lead to sadness and confusion later
on.  <a href="https://xkcd.com/1513/">Don't</a> be 
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1695/">this</a> 
<a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1833/">guy</a>. 

<li>Programming is an art as much as a science.  Effective programming
involves creativity and originality; it is not simply a technical
skill. 

<li>Programming is also a "state of mind."  To program effectively
requires patience, focus, and motivation.  
</ul>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>nuts and bolts and further thoughts on the class</b>
  <h2>About this Course</h2>
</header>

<ul>
<li> I haven't taught this class before, so I'm not certain how it will go.  
  I'm not worried, though.  It may take us a little while to find the 
  right pace and fine-tune class structure.
<li>What we learn in this class will build on itself, so it's extremely 
important that you don't fall behind.
<li>There will be more or less weekly assignments that you'll turn in.
<li>Class time will be a mix of me presenting math and science, me presenting
programming concepts, and me presenting examples that you can then try.  You
should bring your laptop to every class.
<li>I'd like to do some sort of small final project toward the end of the
term.  I'm thinking that this may be a group project, where give you a handful
of different topics to work on. We'll discuss this in class and revisit this
issue during the midterm check-in.
<li>Your evaluation will be based roughly as follows:


	<div class="table-wrapper">
	<table>
	<!--<thead>
	    <tr>
	    <th></th>
	    <th>Thing</th>
	    <th>Percent</th>
	    </tr>
	</thead>-->
	<tbody>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Homework</td>
		<td>65%</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Class participation, including short exercises to be shared in class.</td>
		<td>15%</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Project/final exercise</td>
		<td>20%</td>
	    </tr>
	</tbody>
        <!--<tfoot>
	  <tr>
	    <td></td>
	    <td></td>
	    <td></td>
	  </tr>-->
	</tfoot>
	</table>
	</div>

<!--<li>If winter weather conditions make it unsafe for you to come to campus, do 
not come to class, even if classes have not been officially canceled. -->
</ul>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>collaboration vs copying, and other details</b>
  <h2>Homework</h2>
</header>
<ul>
<li>  Any code that you submit should be uploaded to our shared google drive.  
  Please don't email me code.  Thanks.
<li>On the one hand, coding is a solitary activity. You need to learn how to
write code on your own.  On the other hand, coding is a collaborative activity;
one often discusses ideas and strategies with friends and colleagues.  
Additionally, one sometimes grabs snippets of code from the web or even an
entire program.  
<li> Try to do as much coding on your own as possible.  Especially in the
first half of the course, write from scratch, or by starting with code
we work on together in class. 
<li>Never hesitate to talk about coding ideas or challenges or strategies
with others. It's ok to get help debugging, but resist the urge to get 
help immediately every time.  Debugging is an important skill.  As the
course progresses, you'll get better at it.
<li>If you share code with others, that's ok, but I'd encourage you to not
do this often.  If you do look at others' code and/or look at code on the
web, be sure to cite your sources via comments in your code.  If at all
possible, make sure you understand the code you use.  Sometimes that's
not possible, in which case you should note as much via a comment in your code.
