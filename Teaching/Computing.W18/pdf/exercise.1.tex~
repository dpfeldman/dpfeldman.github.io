\noindent Before class on Friday, Jan 12, please use matplotlib and
python to make an interesting plot.  Upload the plot to the shared
google drive: Scientific Computing 2018/MatplotlibImages.

``Interesting-ness'' in this context is purely subjective.  It could
be some combination of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
  \item You like the shape of the function you plotted
  \item You experimented with additional plot features: colors, marker
    styles, changing labels, making multiple functions appear on the
    same plot.
  \item The plot is amusing or tells a funny story.
\end{enumerate}
Don't stress out on the meaning of interesting.

The goal of this assignment is for you to spend around an hour (maybe
a bit more, but not too much more) experimenting with matplotlib.  Try
different things out.  If you don't understand what a number of
parameter does, try changing it and see what happens.  Plot different
functions and see what they look like.  Explore.
