<DT>2.
<DD>We have seen that a current exerts a force on the magnetic
needle of a compass.  This also works the other way around; the
magnetic field produced by a compass exerts a force on an electric
current.  Convince yourself of this by doing the following:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DD><P>
<DT>(a)
<DD>First, convince yourself that your wires aren't attracted to the
magnet.  You'll find that the alligator clips, on the other hand, are
attracted to the battery.  

<P>
<DT>(b)
<DD>Make a circuit of two batteries and a few pieces of wire.
(Don't hook it up yet, or you'll run down the battery!)

<P>
<DT>(c)
<DD>Hang a length of the wire off the table so it can swing freely.
To get a long enough piece of wire, you'll probably need to string a
few of the wires together.  See the figure on p.&nbsp;497.

<P>
<DT>(d)
<DD>Place a magnet near the wire (but not the alligator clip).  Then
briefly complete the circuit.  Do you notice the wire jump?  Don't
keep the circuit closed for long, or else you'll drain the battery.

<P>
<DT>(e)
<DD>Conduct several such experiments with different poles of the
magnet and with the battery poles reversed.  For each trial, not the
direction of the current, the direction of the magnetic field, and the
direction of the force on the wire.  The direction of the force might
be difficult to see.

<P>
<DT>(f)
<DD>If you can, come up with a theory that related the direction of
current, the direction of the field, and the direction of the force.
(This might be hard; don't worry if you can't.)

<P>
</DL>

<P>
<DT>3.
<DD>Do magnets interact with electrically charged objects?  Do some
experiments with invisible tape and draw a conclusion.  (Remember that
neutral objects will be attracted to charged objects.)  

<P>
<DT>4.
<DD>Do the exercises on p.&nbsp;112 of the handout.  Supplies should be
in the lab -- if not, ask Don Cass.  Trivia question: what is the
name for the device you've built?
