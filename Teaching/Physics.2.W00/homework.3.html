<b>Homework 3:  Due Friday 28 January  </b><p>


<b>Project:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Write a paragraph or so giving me some indication of what you
might do for your final project.  This isn't a binding proposal.
However, by the end of the week you should have a good idea of the
general direction you wish to pursue.  You should also have a
preliminary list of references.  (20 points)<p>
</ol>



<b>Calculating Fields:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>  Consider a long stick of length L with a charge of Q.  We are
interested in calculating the electric field of this stick at a point
P a distance r from the stick.  The point P is positioned such that if
one were to draw a line from the stick to the point and that line was
perpendicular to the stick, the line would intersect the stick at its
midpoint.  (See Fig. E2.5 for a picture of this scenario.)  (30 points
total) 
<ol>
<li>Divide the stick into chunks like we did in class.  Determine the
field at P if the stick is broken up into 1, 2, 4, and 8 chunks.  To
get numerical values, let L=5 and r = 2.  Remember that the electric
field is a vector.
<li>Compare the numerical values above with the exact value obtained
by using equation E2.19b.
<li>In the limit that r is much much bigger than L, what would you
expect the field due to the stick to be and why?  Check equation
E2.19b to make sure that it behaves as you expect.
</ol>
<li>E3B.1 (5 points)
</ol>

<b>Chapter E4:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>E4B.3 (5 points)
<li>E4B.11 (5 points)
<li>E4S.1 (10 points)
<li>E4S.4 (10 points) Toaster Physics!!!
</ol>

<b>Bonus</b><p>
There are lots of great problems.  Here are some you could try.
<ol>
<li>E2R.1 (A neat and useful geometric trick for calculating fields.)
<li>E2A.1 (Calculus.  Shows you a sneaky way to do an integral.)
<li>E2A.2  (More dipole stuff.  Uses the binomial approximation.)
<li>E3A.1 (More integration tricks.)
<li>E4R.2  (Chemical Cells.)
<li>E4R.3  (How to figure out how much a car battery weighs without
actually weighing it.)
</ol>
