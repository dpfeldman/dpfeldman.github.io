<h3>Lab Policies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Failing to attend labs will negatively affect your course grade and
  evaluation.  Labs are an important (and I hope fun) part of the
  course.  We will learn skills here that you won't get a chance to
  practice in homework or discuss much in class.<p>

  <li>After completing the lab, your group will hand in a worksheet.
  This worksheet will ask you to record some of the observations you
  made in lab, draw some conclusions, and perhaps do a problem or
  two.  You can hand in the worksheet right after the lab, or, if you
  prefer, anytime before the following Tuesday.  I will look over the
  lab "report", assign some sort of a grade, and hand it back to you.<p>
  
  <li>Material covered in the labs may appear on exams.<p>

  <li>The lab portion of your evaluation will be based almost
  exclusively on the degree with which you engage the material while
  doing the lab exercises and in your worksheet write-up.<p>

  <li>Typical labs will be around two hours, but some may be
  longer.<p>


</ul>
