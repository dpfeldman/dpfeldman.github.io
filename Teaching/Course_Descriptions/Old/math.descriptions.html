<h1>Description of Courses</h1><p>

These descriptions are unofficial; they are not intended to replace
the course descriptions found in the course catalog.  <p><br>


<h2>Math for Human Ecologists</h2> <i>Instructor:  Don Cass</i>.<p>

This is not a remedial course.  It is designed for students who have
a reasonably solid background in algebra and who wish to gain more
experience using math to describe the real world.  Topics covered will
include:  making and interpreting graphs, logarithms and exponential
growth, and elementary statistics.  Students who have difficulty
applying math to concrete problems may find this course helpful before
taking biology, physics, chemistry, or economics courses.  Math for
Human Ecologists is <i>not</i> a prerequisite for these courses,
however.<p> 

Math for Human Ecologists can also serve as a "pre-calculus" course
for those wishing to hone their algebra skills before entering the
calculus sequence.  Students should be aware, however, that serving as
a gateway to calculus is not the primary function of Math for Human
Ecologists.  <p>

Don is using a different textbook for the course this year.  The new
text is "Functioning in the Real World."  A copy is available in the
library.  I believe it's presently located in the new books section.
The new text does not signal a radical reworking of the course;
however, the course will be slightly different than versions of
Math for Human Ecologists offered in the past.
<p><br>


<h2>College Algebra I</h2> <i>Instructor:  Bo Greene</i>.<p>

From a handout Bo will give to students on the first day of class:<p>

This class is for students who have had algebra and probably algebra 2
in high school.  It is not a remedial math course, but is intended to
bring students to a reasonable level of comfort and competency in
concepts of algebra, either for use in other classes or for its own
sake.  This class may serve as a refresher for a subsequent
precalculus course, but will not, on its own, prepare students for
calculus.<p>  

It is assumed that you have taken high school math, but many of you
may not be satisfied with your level of mastery.  It has also probably
been a long time since you took (or used) math and you may suffer from
the "use it or lose it" phenomenon.<p>


<p><br>


<h2>Calculus I</h2> <i>Instructor:  <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/">Dave Feldman</a></i>.
<p>

This goal of this sequence of courses is to develop the essential
ideas of single-variable calculus:  the limit, the derivative, and the 
integral.  Understanding concepts and applications will be emphasized
over "plug and chug" problems and intricate mathematical maneuverings.
The mathematics learned will be applied to topics from the physical,
natural, and social sciences.  There is a weekly lab/discussion
section.  We will use either computers or graphing calculators; no
experience with these is necessary, however.<p> 

Students entering this course should have a solid background in
algebra and functions.  Students should have taken precalculus in high
school, or math for human ecologists, or have had an equivalent course.
Those who have questions about their preparedness should see me
(Dave). <p>

At least half of the grade in this course will be based on weekly
homework assignments.  There will be exams, but they will probably be
open-book and untimed. 
<p><br>



<h2>Calculus II</h2> <i>Instructor:  <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/">Dave Feldman</a></i>.<p>

This course is the continuation of Calculus I.  It begins by
considering further applications of the integral.  We then move to
approximations and series; we conclude the course with a brief 
treatment of differential equations.  The mathematics learned will be
applied to topics from the physical, natural, and social sciences.

As in Calc I, at least half of the grade in this course will be based
on weekly homework assignments.  There will be exams, but they will
probably be open-book and untimed.  It is likely that I will give
students the option of completing a final project instead of a final
exam.  
<p> 

Students who have had some calculus already and are considering taking
Calc II without Calc I should see me (Dave.)  We will be covering
topics in a slightly untraditional sequence.  I.e., Calc I at COA
includes some topics that often aren't seen until Calc II in
traditional courses, and vice-versa.

<!--<h3>Other Math Possibilities:</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>I may coordinate <b>Introduction to Scientific
Computing</b> as an independent study this fall.  If you have some
interest in taking this, contact me (<a
href="mailto:dave@hornacek.coa.edu">dave@hornacek.coa.edu</a>) as soon
as possible.



Note: Intro to Chemistry I and Applied Economic Analysis do <b>not</b> satisfy the quantitative
reasoning requirement.<p><br>
