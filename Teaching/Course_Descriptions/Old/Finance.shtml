<h1>Microeconomics and Personal Finance Mathematics</h1>
<h3>Instructor: Visitor TBA</h3>
<br>

<b>This course propsal is still quite preliminary.  It has not been
approved by academic affairs.  Davis Taylor and I will continue to
develop the course and will seek a visiting instructor to teach it.
We hope to offer the course during the 1999-2000 academic year.  We
will return to academic affairs with a more detailed proposal in the
spring of 1999. </b><p>
<br>

Topics covered may include some or all of the following:  computing
interest rates, understanding economic indicators, elementary
accounting, elementary statistics, exchange rates.  This will be an
introductory, hands-on course, emphasizing business applications of
math, microeconomics, and the use of spreadsheet programs. <p>

Evaluation will be based on criteria to be determined.  Use of a
spread sheet program will be required, but no computer experience is
necessary. <p>

Prerequisites:  A good high school algebra course.  Introductory.  QR.
