This course is the continuation of Calculus I.  We will cover parts of
Chapters 6 - 10 in <i>Calculus, Single Variable,</i> 2nd edition,
Hughes-Hallet et al, J. Wiley.  The course will begin with a thorough
treatment of anti-derivatives and methods of integration.  We will then
apply integration to problems in physics and economics.  After a brief
discussion of approximations and series, we will conclude the course
by spending a few weeks learning about differential equations and
their many applications.<p>




Students who have had some calculus already and are considering taking
Calc II without Calc I should see me (Dave.) We will be covering
topics in a slightly untraditional sequence. I.e., Calc I at COA
includes some topics that often aren't seen until Calc II in
traditional courses, and vice-versa.  <p>


Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly problem sets,
a take-home, open notes midterm and a final project.  Prerequisite:
Calculus I or the equivalent or consent of the instructor.
Intermediate.  *QR*
