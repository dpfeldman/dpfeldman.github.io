<h1>Biomechanics</h1>
<h3>Instructor: Helen Hess</h3>


Why do we get shorter and wrinklier with age? Were dinosaurs warm-blooded? How do 
grasshoppers hop? These diverse questions are all within the realm of
biomechanics. A knowledge  
                   of biomechanics, or the ways in which plants and
		   animals cope with the laws of physics, can 
                   promote an understanding of organisms at all levels
		   of organization, from molecules to 
                   ecosystems. In this course we explore several areas
		   of physical science, including mechanical 
                   engineering, materials science, and fluid dynamics,
		   as a means of gaining insight into the 
                   biological world. Students attend two lecture
		   sessions per week and one three-hour lab session 
                   for discussions of current research in
		   biomechanics, review of homework assignments, and 
                   laboratory observations or
		   demonstrations. Evaluations are based on
		   participation in discussions, 
                   weekly problem sets, two term papers, and a final
		   exam. Intermediate/Advanced. Prerequisite: one
		   college-level course in biology and one
		   college-level course in math or physics or
		   permission of 
                   instructor. Offered every other year. *ES* *QR*
