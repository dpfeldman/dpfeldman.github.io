This course is an advanced survey of a range of modern topics in
applied mathematics, theoretical physics, and computer science.
Topics covered may include:  chaos, fractals, cellular automata,
boolean networks, random networks and graphs, game theory, agent-based
simulation, and genetic algorithms.  Although Calculus is a
prerequisite for this course, most of the topics in this class are not
an extension or application of calculus; this class is designed to
expose students to an array of non calculus-based mathematics.
Students will be encouraged to make interdisciplinary connections
during class discussions, and especially in their final projects.<p>
 
Evaluation will be based on class participation, bi-weekly problem
sets, a few short writing assignments, and a significant final
project.  Some computer work will be required, but no computer
experience is necessary.<p>
 
Prerequisites: Calculus II (or the equivalent). QR. ES. Lab Fee $15.00.
Advanced/Intermediate.<p>

<b>Description from the 1999 course:</b><p>


This course is a survey of a variety of modern topics in nonlinear
dynamics:  chaotic finite difference equations, fractals,
multifractals, differential equations, boolean networks, and cellular
automata.  The survey will be conducted at a fairly advanced
mathematical level, but the material will be covered with an applied
emphasis.  Numerical results and applications will be stressed rather
than proofs.  The text for this course will be <i>Understanding
Nonlinear Dynamics</i>, by Daniel Kaplan and Leon Glass.  I will
likely supplement the text with readings from journal articles and
other books.  <p> 

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly problem
sets and a final project.   Some computer
work will be required, but no computer experience is necessary. The
final project will provide students an opportunity to examine a
particular topic or application in considerable depth.  Projects can
consist of, but are not limited to:  a more rigorous investigation of
topics covered in class (i.e., a series of formal proofs); a case
study of a particular application; extensive numerical investigation
of a model system; a critical investigation of ``chaos theory's''
impact on literature, art, philosophy, or the social sciences; the
development of lesson plans or a curricular material for either a high
school math course or the introductory course on chaos and fractal
taught at COA. <p>

Prerequisites:  Calculus II (or the equivalent).  Advanced.  QR.
