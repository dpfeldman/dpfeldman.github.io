This course is a continuation of Physics I.  We will cover electricity
and magnetism and Einstein's special theory of relativity.  <p>

We will use unit R of <i>Six Ideas that Shaped Physics,</i>
by Tom Moore as our text for the relativity portion of the course.
For the electricity and magnetism section, we will use <i>Electric and
Magnetic Interactions</i>, by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood.<p>


Evaluations will be based on class participation, weekly homework, an
untimed, open-notes midterm and a final project.  This course makes
extensive use of algebra and trigonometry.  Potentially difficult math
topics will be reviewed as necessary.  Prerequisites: Physics I or the
equivalent, or consent of the instructor.  Intermediate.  *QR* <p>
