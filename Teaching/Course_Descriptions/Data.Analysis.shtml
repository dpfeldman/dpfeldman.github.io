<h1>Field Ecology and Data Analysis</h1>
<h3>Instructor: <a href="http://www.coa.edu/faculty/webpages/cpetersen/">Chris 
Petersen</a></h3>



<p><br>
This course teaches students how to collect data in the field (outside),
how to
             descriptively and quantitatively analyze these data using
spreadsheet and statistical
             programs, and how to present the information in the form of a
report or scientific paper.
             Some of the projects are experimental, while some are
observational. There are four
             field projects during the term, and the tentative project
areas are one terrestrial plant,
             one terrestrial animal, one marine, and one independent
project. The methods learned
             will most likely include measuring population and demographic
parameters, quantifying
             behavior, and estimating community composition. In addition
to taking data in the field,
             students will spend a substantial amount of time learning and
applying statistical
             techniques to describe and analyze data. Lecture material
includes designing data
             collection procedures, statistical analysis, and problem
solving. Evaluations are based on
             write-ups of field exercises, homework on statistical
techniques, oral presentations of
             work, and class participation. Advanced. Prerequisite:
Consent of instructor;
             Intermediate level Ecology or similar courses are helpful.
Class size limited to 15. *ES*
