This class is survey a variety of introductory physics topics,
concentrating on Newton's laws of motion and the conservation of
energy, momentum, and angular momentum.  Topics will be presented both
conceptually and mathematically.  <p>

The text for the course will be <i>Six Ideas that Shaped Physics,</i>
by Tom Moore.  We will cover all of unit C and about a third of unit
N. <p>


Evaluations will be based on class participation, weekly homework, and
two untimed, open-notes exams.  This course makes extensive use of
algebra and trigonometry.  Potentially difficult math topics will be
reviewed as necessary.  Prerequisites:  Math for Human Ecologists, or
a strong high school algebra background, or consent of the instructor.
Introductory.  *QR* <p>
