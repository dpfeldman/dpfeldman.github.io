<h1> College Algebra II</h1>
<h2> Instructor:  Bo Greene</h2>

College Algebra II is the continuation of College Algebra I.  Although
College Algebra I is not necessarily a prerequisite for this course,
it will be assumed that students have a solid understanding of
exponents, radicals, solving equations and inequalities, and working
with basic functions.  Any student who has studied these topics
(similar to the first half of a typical high school algebra II class),
is ready for College Algebra II at COA.  
Topics to be
covered include polynomial, exponential and logarithmic functions,
systems of equations, elementary probability and descriptive
statistics, and, if time permits, elementary trigonometry.  Evaluation
will be based on homework assignments, exams, and class
participation.  <b>QR</b><p>

This email is from Bo, not Dave, and it's about the course I'll be
teaching this spring.  It's called College Algebra 2 and I know it 
probably sounds kind of boring, and maybe even a little scary.  It
won't be and I know that because I'm not boring or scary and algebra
can't make me that way.  I know there are a significant number of you
who should take this class and the trick is to get you motivated to do
it.  This is a chance to get your QR requirement taken care of
(remember, you only have two years to do it), to get your second math
course for teacher certification, to learn some good, basic stuff
about math, and to hang out with me a couple times a week.  
<p>

Although the class will, in some ways, be a sequel to College Algebra 1
(same book) and I will make some assumptions about what you already
know, College Algebra 1 is not a prerequisite for this class.  It's
easy to see if this class would be OK for you:  if you can work with
exponents and radicals, can solve most normal equations and
inequalities, and can do basic graphing, you should be able to handle
the things we'll be doing.  Some understanding of functions (what they
are, what some look like) is pretty important too, but my guess is
that most of you do understand a fair bit about functions already.
We'll start with function stuff and look at some important ones like
polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions.  We'll play with
them, graph them (using graphing calculators) and learn what kinds of
real stuff involves thinking about functions.  We'll also learn some
basic probability and statistics, like what's the probability of being
dealt a full house or how to find the standard deviation for a set of
data (like test scores--good for teachers).  I'm pretty sure we'll get
to some basic trigonometry too, learning how to find angles and sides
of right triangles (remember SOHCAHTOA?).  The topics covered in class
will remind some of you of the beginning of your junior year math
course in high school.  
<p>

Some of what we do will depend on who takes this class, at least in
terms of how we'll do things.  My classes definitely involve homework,
but if you talk to anyone who has taken a class with me, you'll find
out that keeping up is the key and if you can do that, you'll do OK.
I'll be available for lot of help outside of class, and there will be
a couple of tutors, too.  I'll also try and give you a variety of ways
to demonstrate what you learn.  I'd be happy to talk with you about
the class and what you could expect and I'll be at the advising brunch
on Wednesday if anyone has questions.  I have a lot of flexibility
with this class and I'm excited to make it as fun as possible.
