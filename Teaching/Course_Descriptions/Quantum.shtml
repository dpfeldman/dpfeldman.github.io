<h1>Quantum Mechanics</h1>
<h3>Instructor: Dave Feldman</h3>


This course is a focused, highly mathematical introduction to quantum
mechanics.  The goal is to cover about one-third of a junior/senior
level quantum mechanics textbook such as David Griffiths' <i>
Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</i>. 
We will begin by learning the basic structure of quantum mechanics:
The Schrodinger equation, the statistical interpretation of the
wavefunction, and the uncertainty relation.  We will then focus on the
one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation, and study a
number of model systems:  the harmonic oscillator, the delta-function
potential, and the "particle in a box".  Next, we will turn our
attention to some of the mathematical formalism behind quantum
mechanics, including linear algebra and function spaces.  Finally, if
time permits, we will begin a study of quantum mechanics in three
dimensions.   <p>


Along the way, students will encounter a variety of new mathematics,
including ordinary and partial differential equations, linear algebra,
linear vector spaces, and Hilbert spaces.  Knowledge of these topics
is not a prerequisite for the course, however.  <p>

The class will be taught entirely in a discussion format.  Students
and the instructor will choose several problems to work out based on
each week's reading.  Some of these problems may be quite
challenging and require a considerable amount of work.   Evaluation
will be based on class participation and final portfolio of worked
problems. <p> 

Prerequisites:  Calculus II (or the equivalent), Physics I and II (or
the equivalent) and permission of instructor.  Advanced.  QR.  <p>
