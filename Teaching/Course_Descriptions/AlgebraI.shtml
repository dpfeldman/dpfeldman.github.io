<h1> College Algebra </h1>

This class is for students who have had algebra and probably algebra 2
in high school.  It is not a remedial math course, but is intended to
bring students to a reasonable level of comfort and competency in
concepts of algebra, either for use in other classes or for its own
sake.  This class may serve as a refresher for a subsequent
precalculus course, but will not, on its own, prepare students for
calculus.<p>  

It is assumed that you have taken high school math, but many of you
may not be satisfied with your level of mastery.  It has also probably
been a long time since you took (or used) math and you may suffer from
the "use it or lose it" phenomenon.<p>
