<h1> Calculus I</h1>
<h2> Instructor:  Dave Feldman</h2>
<br>
<b>The 1999 Winter Term home page for this course is located <a
href="../Calc.1.W99/index.html">here</a>. </b><p>

The goal of this sequence of courses is to develop the essential ideas
of single-variable calculus:  the limit, the derivative, and the
integral.  Understanding concepts is emphasized over intricate
mathematical maneuverings.  The math learned will be applied to topics
from the physical, natural, and social sciences.  <p>

Our text will be <i>Calculus, Single Variable,</i> 2nd edition,
Hughes-Hallet et al, J. Wiley.  I hope to cover most of chapters 1-5.<p>

Computer work, using the numerical, graphical, and symbolic package
<i>Maple</i> will be required.  No computer experience is necessary;
there will be a weekly lab which will cover the necessary computer
skills. <p>

Students entering this course should have a solid background in
algebra and functions. Students should have taken precalculus in high
school, or math for human ecologists, or have had an equivalent
course. Those who have questions about their preparedness should see
me.  <p>

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly homework, and
two untimed, open-notes exams.
