This course will take an in depth look at the Manhattan Project, the
United States' secret operation that resulted in the world's
first atomic bomb.  We'll look at the advances in physics and 
chemistry that made an atomic bomb possible, and the events of 
World War II that made a weapon of mass destruction desirable to 
many.  Students will gain a qualitative understanding of the basic
physics behind the atomic bomb.  More importantly, students will gain
an awareness of the historical and cultural context in which the bomb
was built. <p>


Our main text will be Richard Rhodes' <i>The
Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, an incredibly thorough and extremely
well-written account of the scientific discoveries and historical
events that made the atomic bomb possible.  We will also read
selections from some of the following:
<ul>

<li> <i>The Physicists</i>, Daniel J. Kevles
<li> <i>Critical Mass:  America's Race to Build the A-Bomb</i>, Lisa Anderson
<li> <i>By the Bomb's Early Light</i>, Paul Boyer
<li> <i>The Binding Curve of Energy</i>, John McPhee
<li> <i>Hiroshima: Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb</i>, Ronald Takaki 
<li> <i>Hiroshima</i>, John Hersey.
</ul>
<p>

We'll conclude the course by examining how the atomic bomb changed
politics and culture, and how the Manhattan project shaped how science
and scientists are viewed, but within and outside the scientific
establishment.  Some of the
questions we'll address may include:  How have fears of the bomb been
expressed in art and literature?  What responsibilities do scientists
have when developing technologies that can be harnessed to harmful
purposes?  How is science funded in the United States and how was this
influenced by the Manhattan Project?  What role
should government play in encouraging or discouraging the development
of technologies?  How can science be made more democratic? <p>

This course will be taught in a seminar style; there will be a
significant amount of reading and classes will be largely
discussion-based.  Each student will keep a journal throughout the
course and will complete a final project of her or his choosing.  
<p>

Evaluations will be based on class participation, a journal, and a
final project.  Intermediate/Advanced.  *HY*
