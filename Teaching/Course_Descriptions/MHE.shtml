<h1> Math for Human Ecologists</h1>
<h2> Instructor:  Don Cass</h2>

This is not a remedial course.  It is designed for students who have
a reasonably solid background in algebra and who wish to gain more
experience using math to describe the real world.  Topics covered will
include:  making and interpreting graphs, logarithms and exponential
growth, and elementary statistics.  Students who have difficulty
applying math to concrete problems may find this course helpful before
taking biology, physics, chemistry, or economics courses.  Math for
Human Ecologists is <i>not</i> a prerequisite for these courses,
however.<p> 

Math for Human Ecologists can also serve as a "pre-calculus" course
for those wishing to hone their algebra skills before entering the
calculus sequence.  Students should be aware, however, that serving as
a gateway to calculus is not the primary function of Math for Human
Ecologists.  <p>
