Differential equations are an application of calculus used to model a
wide variety of physical and natural phenomena.  For example, the rate
at which a cup of coffee cools, populations of predators and prey in
ecosystems, the spread of disease, and the rate at which raindrops
fall, are all examples of systems that have been described with
differential equations.  This course is a focused introduction to
differential equations.  Students will learn a variety of modern
methods for solving differential equations, and will also learn
techniques for forming models using differential equations.  In so
doing, we will discuss the benefits and shortcomings of this approach
to mathematical modeling.<p>

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly problem sets
and a final project.  Some computer work will be required, but no
computer experience is necessary.  The final project will consist of
an in-depth study of a differential equation.  This will include: a
discussion of the phenomena the equation is intended to model; a
derivation of the equation; a detailed solution to the equation; and a
critical discussion of the results of the model.  The project will be
presented both orally and in writing.<p>

Prerequisites:  Calculus II or the equivalent or permission of
instructor.  Intermediate/Advanced.  QR.  ES.  Lab fee $15.  <p>
