<h1> Understanding Functions (Formerly College Algebra II)</h1>
<h2> Instructor:  Bo Greene</h2>

This course covers a variety of math topics at a pre-calculus
level. It is designed for students who have a working knowledge of
basic algebra 
skills (exponents, radicals, solving equations, simple functions) and
wish to broaden their math background and focus on application. A
significant 
part of the course will focus on various aspects of using
functions. Students will learn to work with and apply linear,
quadratic, polynomial, rational, 
exponential and logarithmic functions. Understanding and
interpretation will be emphasized rather than mathematical
manipulation. Graphing 
calculators will be especially helpful. Other topics will include
trigonometry in solving triangles, counting and probability, and basic
statistics. 
Again, the emphasis will be on problem solving and
application. Students will be evaluated mainly on weekly homework
assignments, two 
take-home exams, and a class presentation. Group work and
participation will be an important aspect of the course. Although
Functions is logical 
follow-up to College Algebra, it is not necessary to have completed
the algebra course first. QR. Introductory. <p>
