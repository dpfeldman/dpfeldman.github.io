<h1>The Nature and Language of Mathematics</h1>
<h3>Instructor: Jen Gutmann</h3>


The Nature and Language of Mathematics is an introductory course
designed to help students discover the connections between mathematics
and other areas of human understanding.  By exploring diverse
mathematics topics, students will see the varied roles that
mathematics play in our world.  Topics covered will include graph
theory, probability, estimation, and linear equations.  The majority
of in-class work will take place in small groups, allowing students to
be active, engaged learners.  Students will read several articles, as
well as "Fermat's Enigma", a popular book chronicling the recent
solution of a 350 year old problem in number theory.  Through this
course, the student will be encouraged to understand the patterns,
language, and logic that underlies what we call "mathematics". <p>

Evaluation will be based on class participation and group work, weekly 
projects and assignments, occasional quizzes, and a research paper.
Students may also be asked to present their research topic orally.<p>

No prerequisites are required for this course.  Lab fee:  $10.  QR.<p>
