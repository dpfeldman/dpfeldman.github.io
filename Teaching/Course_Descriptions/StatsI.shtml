<h1>Introduction to Statistics and Research Design</h1>
<h3>Instructor: Sean Todd</h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.coa.edu/faculty/webpages/stodd/oceanweb/stats/stat1home.htm">Web page for the winter 2001 course</a></h3>


This course introduces the basics of statistical analysis that can be
used  in either a scientific or social science frame of
reference. While this course teaches you to perform both nonparametric
and simple parametric analysis both by hand and by computer, an
emphasis will be placed on  understanding the principles and
assumptions of each test, rather than mathematical ability <i>per
se</i>. We will also learn how to report statistical results in
journal format, and there will be plenty of lab time to sharpen your
skills. Evaluation is based on lab participation, two quizzes and
several choices of take-home problems. Introductory/Intermediate.
Prerequisite: A college mathematics course, or permission of the
instructor (student should have a solid background in albegra.)
