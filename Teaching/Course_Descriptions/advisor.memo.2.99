Dear Advisor,

Below is a note from Bo Greene that I'm about to forward to students.
Bo will be teaching College Algebra II this spring.  As this is a new
course at COA, we wanted to publicize it a bit so people knew what to
expect. 

In talking with your advisees about registering this spring and
planning next year's courses, here are a few things to keep in mind:  

	1.  Students are required to take at least one quantitative
reasoning course by the end of their second year.  (See p. 2 of the
COA course catalog.)

	2.  Many students delay taking a QR course.  This is
certainly understandable, and I'm well aware of the other requirements
that entering students must complete:  Core course, writing, and
history.  However, there are some reasons why I think it's better to
take a QR course sooner rather than later:

	A.  With a solid math and quantitative reasoning
	background, students will get much more out of some classes.	

	B.  Students with weak math skills worry that a QR course will
	difficult and/or unpleasant.  However, waiting to take a QR
	course won't make it any easier.  I think it's better to take
	a math course before too much high school math is forgotten.



More information about upcoming math and QR courses can be found on my
web site at:

Here you will find a schedule of all the quantitative reasoning
courses planned through the 99-00 academic year. 


As always, if you have questions about math or QR courses, please let
me know.


Dave Feldman

This email is from Bo, not Dave, and it's about the course I'll be
teaching this spring.  It's called College Algebra 2 and I know it 
probably sounds kind of boring, and maybe even a little scary.  It
won't be and I know that because I'm not boring or scary and algebra
can't make me that way.  I know there are a significant number of you
who should take this class and the trick is to get you motivated to do
it.  This is a chance to get your QR requirement taken care of
(remember, you only have two years to do it), to get your second math
course for teacher certification, to learn some good, basic stuff
about math, and to hang out with me a couple times a week.  

Although the class will, in some ways, be a sequel to College Algebra 1
(same book) and I will make some assumptions about what you already
know, College Algebra 1 is not a prerequisite for this class.  It's
easy to see if this class would be OK for you:  if you can work with
exponents and radicals, can solve most normal equations and
inequalities, and can do basic graphing, you should be able to handle
the things we'll be doing.  Some understanding of functions (what they
are, what some look like) is pretty important too, but my guess is
that most of you do understand a fair bit about functions already.
We'll start with function stuff and look at some important ones like
polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions.  We'll play with
them, graph them (using graqhing calculators) and learn what kinds of
real stuff involves thinking about functions.  We'll also learn some
basic probability and statistics, like what's the probability of being
dealt a full house or how to find the standard deviation for a set of
data (like test scores--good for teachers).  I'm pretty sure we'll get
to some basic trigonometry too, learning how to find angles and sides
of right triangles (remember SOHCAOTOA?).  The topics covered in class
will remind some of you of the beginning of your junior year math
course in high school.  

Some of what we do will depend on who takes this class, at least in
terms of how we'll do things.  My classes definitely involve homework,
but if you talk to anyone who has taken a class with me, you'll find
out that keeping up is the key and if you can do that, you'll do OK.
I'll be available for lot of help outside of class, and there will be
a couple of tutors, too.  I'll also try and give you a variety of ways
to demonstrate what you learn.  I'd be happy to talk with you about
the class and what you could expect and I'll be at the advising brunch
on Wednesday if anyone has questions.  I have a lot of flexibility
with this class and I'm excited to make it as fun as possible.
