<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>


<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Lab Participation and Write-ups:</b> 10 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 40 percent.
<!--<li><b>Final Reference Sheet:</b> 10 percent.-->
</ul>


<p class="no-box">I (dave) recommend against grades; I believe they
  are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
  learning.  We will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  We do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 


<h3>Class Structure and Policies</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page. 

<li> Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on
  Friday. More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result
  in me mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade. 

<li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be very careful to not fall
  farther behind every week.  

<li> We will accept late homework assignments. However, we may not be
  able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  Multiple late
  assignments will result in a lowering of your grade and mention in
  your narrative evaluation.

<li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
  no higher than a C. 

<li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
  also consult us, class tutors, other faculty, friends, and
  family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
  understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
  problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
  just copy their solution and turn it in. 

<li> As we plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email, it is important that you check your email
  regularly. 

<li> Unless we have made arrangements in advance, you are expected to 
  come to class and lab and participate in discussion and group
  exercises.  
 
<li> Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad. Any
  cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
  hearing; see the academic handbook for details. Possible
  consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion. 

</ol>




<h3>Other Thoughts about the Class</h3>

<p class="no-box">
<ol>

<li>This is the fourth time we've taught the class, so we're fairly
  certain how it will go, but there are still some things we are
  experimenting with. 

<li>It will take us a week or so to get to know you and figure out the  
  pace of the class.  There are always topics that we would like to
  spend more time on but can't.  

<!--<li> We are also still experimenting with some of the lab exercises.-->

<li> This class is a lot of work.  It's very important to not fall
  behind.  Doing well on your project will require a significant time 
  investment.  Most of this work will occur weeks 7-10.  

<li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
  technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
  There is also a temptation to get bogged down in debates about
  policy.  We should collectively resist these temptations; there are
  a lot of important topics to learn about. 

</ol>


<h3>What this Class Isn't</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">This course is not about the following things,
  although this course should help you do/think about the following
  things better and smarter. 
<ul>

<li>Energy policy
<li>Social impacts of energy technologies
<li>Environmental impacts of energy technologies
<li>Weatherproofing your house
<li>Building your own wind turbine
<li>An encyclopedic coverage of everything about energy
<li>Climate change and global warming

</ul>
