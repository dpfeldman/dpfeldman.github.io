The following revised statements on academic integrity were passed
unanimously by the faculty during winter term, 1999.<p><br>





<h3>Revised COA Catalog text (see 1998-99 Catalog, p. 4)</h3>

<b>Academic Integrity</b><p>

By your enrollment in an academic institution, you are subscribing to
common standards of academic honesty.  Any cheating, plagiarism,
falsifying or fabricating data, or illegally using artwork of others
is a breach of such standards and is unacceptable.  Students and
faculty share responsibility to clarify conventions of attribution, so
that no one uses words or works of others, including artwork, without
proper acknowledgment.  If you do not understand or have questions
about what constitutes ethical scholarship, ask that the issue be
discussed in class.  Cases of academic dishonesty may be resolved
between student and teacher or, at the discretion of either party, may
be referred to a judiciary hearing coordinated by an Academic Dean.
Consequences for violations may range from losing credit for an
assignment or course up to suspension or expulsion from COA.  (See
related discussion of academic misconduct in the COA Handbook.) <p>

<h3>Revised COA Handbook text (see 1998-99 Handbook, p. 13)</h3>

<b>Academic Misconduct</b><p>

Academic misconduct is a breach of common standards of academic
honesty as well as a breach of any particular instructions provided by
a professor in a given class.  Examples include cheating, plagiarism,
or any other form of using the work of another person without proper
acknowledgment.  Another example of academic misconduct is the
deliberate removal of library books or of essential reference or
reserve material; this aspect also includes monopolizing or abusing
resources other students need to complete academic projects.  Cases of
academic misconduct may be resolved between student and teacher or, at
the discretion of either party, may be referred to a judiciary hearing
coordinated by an Academic Dean.   Consequences for violations may
range from losing credit for an assignment or course up to suspension
or expulsion from COA.  (See related discussion of academic integrity
in the COA Catalog.) <p>
