      <h1>Basic Info</h1>
      
      <p><b>Computational text analysis</b> (CTA) is an emerging field that
      uses computation to analyze texts. CTA draws on the fields of
      computer science, machine learning, computational linguistics,
      and literary theory. Using machine learning and statistics,
      computers can be used to explore how language is used in
      particular contexts, including how frequently different words
      are used, the sentiment of a word/text, as well as nuances in
      the ways words are associated with one another. We will use CTA
      to engage in "Distant Reading", a term coined by literary
      theorist Franco Moretti. Distant Reading stands in contrast to
      the more familiar "Close Reading": a deep engagement with a
      particular text or a passage from a text. Distant Reading
      engages not with a particular text, but with a large corpus of
      texts: e.g., all novels published in English in the 20th
      century, all articles written in The New York Times and The
      Washington Post in the last decade, or the lyrics of all top-100
      pop songs from the 1980s. Computational techniques applied to
      large collections of texts allow one to ask broad questions
      about structural and linguistic change over time and to look for
      patterns of language use that would not be evident from analysis
      of one or even several individual texts. Distant Reading, and
      computational text analysis more generally, is not intended to
      replace close reading, but to complement it. We will use CTA to
      explore how power structures and systems such as race, gender,
      and colonialism manifest themselves in bodies of text.</p>

      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Let's think about what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by
	<a href="https://fardila.com/" target="_blank">Federico Ardila-Mantilla</a>.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.  
	</blockquote>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Participation and Engagement</h3>
      
      <p> We will do a lot of different things in our class sessions, including discussing readings. The readings we do will range widely in content,
	style, and difficulty. There are several goals and motivations we have for discussions:</p> 
      <ul>
	<li>The discussions are a chance to figure out some things
	  together. We will be doing some readings that are sometimes technically and/or theoretically
	  difficult and subtle and, we hope, interesting. Working together, we can solidify and deepen our understanding. 
	<li>In some of the discussions it will be particularly valuable to hear a diversity of opinions. We expect there
	  will be a range of reactions and responses to some of what we read, and there is tremendous value to actively
	  listening to and engaging with a diversity of thought and experiences. 
      </ul>
      
      <p>Expectations for class discussions:
	<ul>
	  <li>Prepare. Do the reading and think about it. Expect to
	  spend an hour or two preparing, although obviously this will
	  vary a lot from reading to reading. Take notes, write down
	  questions, and prepare responses to any questions we might
	    have posed.</li>
	  <li>Have a copy (electronic or paper) of the reading open so we can easily refer to the text if needed.</li>
	  <!--<li>If you can work with a hard copy of the reading. I think
	  it is easier to engage with a text via a physical copy, and
	  as much as possible I don't want us to have laptops open
	  when we meet. But regardless, be sure to have a copy, -->
	  <li> Be present. Listen to others, respond, and contribute
	  your own ideas and questions.  </li>
	</ul>
	
      <p>We should all work to create an inviting atmosphere and
      ensure that there is opportunity for all to contribute. At the
      same time, there is no need for everybody to contribute
      equally. It is natural for some people to talk more than others,
      and we think this is normal and good. Also, we expect that
      students will engage and contribute at different levels,
      depending on prior coursework. Again, we see this diversity of
      backgrounds as a strength and not a weakness; there are roles
      for everyone to play. Asking good questions is as important as
      providing answers.</p> 

      <p>The point of discussions is not to figure out who is right and who
	is wrong, but to help all of us get to a deeper, and not necessarily uniform, understanding. Disagreements can and will happen,
	of course, but those disagreements will be investigated in a way that respects every participant's right to their own opinion.</p> 
      
      <p><b>Attendance policy: </b> Because of the workshop/seminar nature of this class, attendance and active participation are crucial.
	As such, your attendance in class is necessary not only to your success but also to the success of your classmates. Therefore,
	<b>you are allowed two unexcused absences without penalty</b>. Please don't hesitate to contact us in case of illness, emergencies,
	and other extenuating circumstances.</p>

      <h3>What your Evaluation is Based on</h3>
      
      <p>Your evaluation will be based loosely on the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>Class participation and engagement: 20 percent</li>
	  <li>Short homework exercises, coding and otherwise: 20 percent</li>
	  <li>Leading paper discussion: 10 percent</li>
	  <li>Final project: 50 percent</li>
	</ul>
	In general, we recommend against grades; we believe they are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
	This is especially true in this class, where we have found that many of the class activities really don't lend themselves to
	letter grading. We do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.

      <h1>More Course Info and Advice</h1>
      <h3>Structure and Pacing</h3>
      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li>It is perhaps best to think of this course as a
	    workshop/seminar.
	    <ul>
	      <li>It is a <b>workshop</b> in that we'll be doing lots
	      of experimenting, trying things out, and so on. Expect
	      to be doing lots of coding, de-bugging, re-thinking,
	      and so on, both in groups and individually.  </li>
	      <li>It's a <b>seminar</b> in the sense that there will
	      often be readings and/or exercises for class, and we'll
	      spend class discussing and comparing ideas and results.</li> 
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Relatedly, we will not be following a textbook, nor will
	    be there be many homework assignments to hand in.</li>
	  <li>The syllabus is fluid and the pacing and exact topics we
	  cover will depend on the students in the class.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
            
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>What this Class Isn't</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>This is not a class on artificial intellegence (whatever
	  that means).</li>
	<li>We will not cover large language models (LLMs) such as
	  ChatGPT, etc.</li>
	<li>This is not an introductory programing class, in the sense
	that it's not designed to systematically cover a standard set
	of introductory coding topics and skills. That said, the
	course does cover some coding techniques, and so could be a
	good chance to "level up" your coding skills -- including for
	those who have no coding experience.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>


      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Help/Coding Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	Once we get into the more programming-intensive part of the
	course, there will be help/coding sessions. 
	You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on assignments
	  and the final project.</li>
	  <!--<li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>-->
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course. Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Almost always there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>We are happy to meet with students one-on-one. The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email. There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session. (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions!  But we understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for your project.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the
	TA. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

  
      <h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is our intention that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. we aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. We are always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression. Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know of ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including us) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know. You can also reach out to Provost Ken
	Hill or Associate Dean Kourtney Collum.

      <h3>Gender-based discrimination: Title IX</h3>

      <p>COA is dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive
      campus where all community members have equal access to COA’s
      educational and employment opportunities. We strive to promote
      an environment of respect, safety, and well-being and will not
      tolerate gender-based or sexual discrimination nor sexual
      harassment of any kind. </p>

      <p>As faculty members, we are considered "responsible employees"
      and are required to share any disclosures of sexual or
      gender-based misconduct with the Title IX Coordinator. This
      includes disclosures of experiences that happened before an
      individual's time at COA. This is to ensure that all community
      members who have experienced sexual misconduct receive support,
      options, and information about their rights and
      resources. Community members are not obligated to respond to
      this outreach, and this will not generate a report to law
      enforcement. </p>

      <p>For more information regarding Title IX, our institutional policy,
	and to access helpful resources, visit COA’s Title IX website:
	<a href="https://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix" target="_blank">https://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix</a>.</p> 

      <p>If you have any questions or want to explore support and
	assistance, please contact COA’s Title IX Coordinator,
	Puranjot Kaur, at pkaur@coa.edu. Speaking to the Title IX
	Coordinator does not automatically initiate a college
	resolution. Instead, much of her work is around providing
	supportive measures to ensure you can continue to engage in
	COA's programs and activities.</p>
      
      <p><b>Note on Pregnancy and Related Conditions:</b></p>
      
      <p>Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in education
	programs and activities. This prohibition on discrimination extends
	to pregnancy and related conditions. Pregnancy and related
	conditions encompass pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, termination
	of pregnancy, false pregnancy, lactation, or recovery from any of
	these conditions. </p> 
      
      <p>Students experiencing pregnancy or related conditions may
	voluntarily initiate contact with the Title IX Coordinator to
	request reasonable adjustments available under Title IX. Reasonable
	adjustments may include but are not limited to: excusing student
	absences; allowing students to make up missed work; opportunities to
	move around during class; additional breaks; missing some or all of
	a class session to nurse or pump, and to have the opportunity to
	make up any work missed. Information on lactation space on campus
	can be found here:
	<a href="http://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix/support-resources/lactation-space"
	   target="_blank">http://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix/support-resources/lactation-space</a>.</p> 
      
      <p>Students who believe they have been subject to discrimination
	because of pregnancy or related condition status may file a
	formal complaint with the Title IX Coordinator. If you are a
	pregnant or parenting student, and you are in need of any
	adjustments. please let me know at your earliest
	convenience.</p> 
      
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      
      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li>We are required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</li>
	    
	  <li>We are also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you'll spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </li>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important to
      acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
