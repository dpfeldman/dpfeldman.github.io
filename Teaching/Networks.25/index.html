      <h1>Basic Info</h1>

      <p>Network science is an active and growing cross-disciplinary area
	that focuses on the description, representation, analysis, and
	modeling of complex social, biological, and technological systems as
	networks or graphs. At its simplest, a network is a collection of
	nodes, some of which are connected by edges.</p> 
      
      <p>For example, nodes might be scientists, and there would be an edge
	connecting two scientists if they co-authored a scientific paper. Or
	nodes might be facebook users, and there would be an edge between
	two users if they were facebook friends. Structures and systems
	modeled as networks are ubiquitous in the world around us:
	communication networks, networks of friends and acquaintances
	(online and in-person), gene regulatory networks, supply chains, and
	food webs, to name just a few.<p> 
	
      <p>In general, networks are used as models in situations in
	which the architecture of connectivity matters, but where that
	connectivity is neither random (as in an ideal gas or
	non-interacting agents) nor regular (as in a crystal lattice
	or a situation where agents interact spatially). Capturing,
	modeling, and understanding networks requires understanding
	both the mathematics of networks and the computational tools
	for identifying and explaining the patterns they contain.</p> 

      <p>This course will consist of a survey of techniques for
	modeling and analyzing the structure and dynamics of
	networks. We will begin with basic definitions and simple
	descriptive statistics. We will then look at random graphs,
	which are useful for generating intuition and serving as
	simple null models. We will then consider network prediction
	models that can be used to predict node attributes and missing
	edges, and approaches for detecting community structure. As
	time permits, we will examine dynamical models on networks,
	such as disease and rumor spreading. Throughout, we will take
	a computational approach, learning how to work with network
	data and how to implement algorithms for network models and
	data  analysis.</p>

      <p>Evaluation will be based on participation in class sessions,
      coding exercises, and a final project.</p> 

      <p> This class meets the <b>QR</b> requirement. It does not meet
	the ES requirement.</p>

      <h3>Structure and Pacing</h3>
      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li>This is a tutorial and it will be taught in a 
	    workshop/seminar format.
	    <ul>
	      <li>It is a <b>workshop</b> in that we'll be doing lots
	      of experimenting, trying things out, and so on. Expect
	      to be doing lots of coding, de-bugging, re-thinking,
	      and so on, both in groups and individually.  </li>
	      <li>It's a <b>seminar</b> in the sense that rather than me
		preparing lectures for class, there will be usually be
	      readings and/or exercises that we'll all do, and we'll 
	      spend class discussing and comparing ideas and results.</li> 
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>We will be work through the book <i>A First Course in
	      Network Science</i> by Menczer, Fortunato, and Davis.</li>
	  <li>We will also follow <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/courses/5352/"

	    the University of Colorado, Boulder, by <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/"
						       target="_blank">Aaron Clauset</a>.
	  <li>I would like to spend the first 3-4 weeks of the term sprinting. We'll do
	    a fast-paced survey of network science and become familiar with networks.
	    We'll then slow down and zoom in on some particular methods and application
	    areas, depending on student interest.</li>

      <h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is our intention that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. we aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. We are always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression. Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know of ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including us) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know. You can also reach out to Provost Ken
	Hill or Associate Dean Kourtney Collum.

      <h3>Gender-based discrimination: Title IX</h3>

      <p>COA is dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive
      campus where all community members have equal access to COA’s
      educational and employment opportunities. We strive to promote
      an environment of respect, safety, and well-being and will not
      tolerate gender-based or sexual discrimination nor sexual
      harassment of any kind. </p>

      <p>As faculty members, we are considered "responsible employees"
      and are required to share any disclosures of sexual or
      gender-based misconduct with the Title IX Coordinator. This
      includes disclosures of experiences that happened before an
      individual's time at COA. This is to ensure that all community
      members who have experienced sexual misconduct receive support,
      options, and information about their rights and
      resources. Community members are not obligated to respond to
      this outreach, and this will not generate a report to law
      enforcement. </p>

      <p>For more information regarding Title IX, our institutional policy,
	and to access helpful resources, visit COA’s Title IX website:
	<a href="https://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix" target="_blank">https://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix</a>.</p> 

      <p>If you have any questions or want to explore support and
	assistance, please contact COA’s Title IX Coordinator,
	Puranjot Kaur, at pkaur@coa.edu. Speaking to the Title IX
	Coordinator does not automatically initiate a college
	resolution. Instead, much of her work is around providing
	supportive measures to ensure you can continue to engage in
	COA's programs and activities.</p>
      
      <p><b>Note on Pregnancy and Related Conditions:</b></p>
      
      <p>Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in education
	programs and activities. This prohibition on discrimination extends
	to pregnancy and related conditions. Pregnancy and related
	conditions encompass pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, termination
	of pregnancy, false pregnancy, lactation, or recovery from any of
	these conditions. </p> 
      
      <p>Students experiencing pregnancy or related conditions may
	voluntarily initiate contact with the Title IX Coordinator to
	request reasonable adjustments available under Title IX. Reasonable
	adjustments may include but are not limited to: excusing student
	absences; allowing students to make up missed work; opportunities to
	move around during class; additional breaks; missing some or all of
	a class session to nurse or pump, and to have the opportunity to
	make up any work missed. Information on lactation space on campus
	can be found here:
	<a href="http://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix/support-resources/lactation-space"
	   target="_blank">http://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix/support-resources/lactation-space</a>.</p> 
      
      <p>Students who believe they have been subject to discrimination
	because of pregnancy or related condition status may file a
	formal complaint with the Title IX Coordinator. If you are a
	pregnant or parenting student, and you are in need of any
	adjustments. please let me know at your earliest
	convenience.</p>

      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li>We are required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</li>
	    
	  <li>We are also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you'll spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </li>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important to
      acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
