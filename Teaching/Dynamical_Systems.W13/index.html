<h2>Course Structure</h2>
This tutorial will meet two to three times a week.  Class meetings
will be a combination of lecture, discussion, group work, and
programming sessions.  For almost all class meetings I will assign
exercises that students will do in groups and then discuss in class.
Students will do a final project in which they look at a particular
application of dynamical systems to an area of science.  Using this
analysis as a starting point, students will also consider what general
lessons from dynamical systems are important for this scientific
area.  <br><br>

<h2>Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Introduction I: Dynamical Systems</b>  Finite difference
  equations and differential equations.  Solution methods, focusing
  almost exclusively on numerical methods.  <!--What solutions mean and
  how to think about them.  The role of differential equations in
  science-->

<li><b>Introduction II: Global and Qualitative Analysis of Dynamical
Systems.</b>  Global analysis of dynamical systems.  Stable and
  unstable solutions.  Fixed points and periodic behavior.  Phase
  space. 

<li><b>Small Changes Yield Big Changes.</b> Bifurcations.
  Catastrophes.  Hystersis.  Multiple equilibria.

<li><b>Disorder from Order.</b>  Chaos.  Sensitive dependence on
  initial conditions (butterfly effect).  Lyapunov exponents. 

<li><b>Coexistence of Order and Disorder.</b>  Stable chaos.
  Invariant densities.  Strange attractors.

<li><b>Complex Behavior from Simple Rules.</b>  Strange attractors.
  Pattern formation.  Self-organization and emergence.

<li><b>Conclusion.</b>

This course is a survey of dynamical systems, the field of applied
mathematics that studies systems that change over time.   The modern
study of dynamical systems includes examining particular systems or
areas of application, as well as looking at systems more broadly and
abstractly to develop generally applicable tools for studying
dynamical systems or to classify different sorts of behavior.
</p>

<p class="no-box">This course is intended for motivated students with
  strong math 
backgrounds who wish to gain an overview of dynamical systems and to
discuss and debate the insights the study of dynamical systems holds
for the physical, natural, and social sciences.  Using both
differential equations and difference equations as our main items of
study, we will cover standard topics in dynamical systems, including
phase space, bifurcation diagrams, chaotic behavior, sensitive
dependence on initial conditions, strange attractors, embedding and
attractor reconstruction, and Lyapunov exponents.  A central theme
that emerges from the study of dynamical systems is that there is a
subtle relationship between order and disorder.  Unpredictable
behavior can arise from deterministic dynamical systems, and complex
behavior can have simple origins.  We shall see that predictability
and unpredictability, simplicity and complexity, and order and
disorder are not opposites, but are often exist simultaneously in the
same dynamical system.  </p>

<p class="no-box">Evaluation will be based on participation in
  seminar-style class sessions, problems sets, and a final project and
  presentation. </p>

<p class="no-box">Intermediate.  No lab fee.  Prerequisites:  Calculus
  II and permission of instructor.  Experience writing simple computer
  programs (in any language) will be helpful, but not required.  Class
  size limited to 5.
