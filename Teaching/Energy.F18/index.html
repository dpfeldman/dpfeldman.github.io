To have constructive conversations about the world's energy
  options, one needs to take a calm look at the numbers.... If the
  world is to move to a sustainable energy future, one that also
  limits the risk of global warming, each country will need to work
  out its own post-fossil-fuel energy plan. And the numbers will have
  to add up.... Countries [and states, towns, colleges, and
  individuals] that claim to be serious about creating an alternative
  energy future need to choose a plan, stop arguing and get
  building.<br>  <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/">David

<h3>Course Goals</h3>

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Gain a solid understanding of the basic physics of energy and the
  science behind various energy technologies.
  <li>Gain skills and experience performing and communicating
 quantitative analyses of energy generation and consumption. 
</ol>
<p class="no-box">
Some specific topic areas, skills, and habits of mind to be emphasized
include:<br> 
<ol>
  <li>Students will develop a set of benchmarks so as to have an
  intuitive feel for energy consumption, from the individual to the
  global. 
  <li>Numbers not adjectives!  An energy plan has to add up.  
  <li>The emphasis will be on sustainable energy solutions that scale
  up.  The energy problem is a big one, and so solutions need to be
  big. 
  <li>Students will gain skills and experience using spreadsheets to
  perform and present quantitative analyses.
  <li>Students will also learn how to do basic but important financial
  calculations. 
</ol>

The main text for this course will be David MacKay's Sustainable
Energy &mdash; Without the Hot Air.  This book is available in hard
copy and for free online
at:  <a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/">http://www.withouthotair</a>.
It's an awesome book.  We will also use a set of notes that I am
writing.

<h3>Official Description</h3>


<p>
In this course students will learn content and skills so that they can
participate effectively in sustainable energy projects, make personal
and community decisions that reduce carbon emissions, and work in
ventures in sustainable energy.  Additionally, this course will be
useful for those interested in energy and climate policy, either
internationally or domestically.  We will begin with a quick overview
of current CO2 emissions levels and look at how this is related to
energy use.  We will then turn our attention to basic ideas from
physics, including the definition of energy and the difference between
energy and power.  The bulk of the course will consist of a survey of
different forms of energy consumption and generation.  Throughout, we
will quantitatively analyze technology from both a local and global
point of view.  For example, we will calculate how much electricity
one can generate on a rooftop, and we will also examine the role that
solar PV could play toward the goal of eliminating fossil fuel use
worldwide.  In a unit on financial mathematics, students will learn
about the time value of money and several ways of quantifying
investments, including ROI (return on investment) and IRR (internal
rate of return).  Students will apply these financial tools in several
short case studies.  If time permits, we may also cover negative
emissions technologies and the electrical grid, including grid
stability issues and the potential of smart-grid technology.
