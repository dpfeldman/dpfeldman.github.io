<h3>Basic Info</h3>
<p>
<b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave">Dave
  Feldman</a><br>   
<b>Office:</b> Second Floor of Turrets Annex<br>  
<b>Office Hours:</b> TBA and by appointment.<br>
<b>TAs:</b> Anita van Dam<br>
<b>Help Sessions:</b> TBA<br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Homework Assignments:</b> 85 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 15 percent.
<!--<li><b>Mastery Quizzes:</b> 25 percent.-->
<!--<li><b>Lab Participation and Write-ups:</b> 10 percent.-->
<!--<li><b>Final Project:</b> 40 percent (split roughly equally between
  the presentation and technical report). -->
<!--<li><b>Final Reference Sheet:</b> 10 percent.-->
</ul>
<p>Most of these assignments will be problem sets where you will
  practice skills and techniques that we learn in class. Toward the
  end of the course there will likely also be some short case studies
  and longer problems. There may also be a final synthetic problem
  set and/or some short take-home quizzes.</p>


<p class="no-box">I usually recommend against grades; I believe they
  often interfere with genuine, reflective learning.  But I am happy
  to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of A's, B's,
  etc. </p>  


<h3>Class Structure and Policies</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page. 

<li>This is my eigth time teaching this class, and the third time
  I've taught it on my own. In the past I've the class
  with Anna Demeo, and the course has had a significant project.  This
  version of the course is not project based. This will let us cover
  more material and go a bit deeper into some topics. 

<li>This year I've added two discussion sections to the class.  You
  should enroll in one of these sections.  This will let us do a
  variety of more interactive, hands-on things.  I plan on using this
  time to experiment with a number of different activities.  

<!--<li>During the first part of the course there will almost always be
  homework due at the beginning of class.  Every day.  Evaluation on
  these assignments will be based mostly on effort.  It is essential
  that you do these assignments.-->

<!--<li> During the first part of the course you will be taking a number
  of mastery quizzes.  These are short tests designed to make sure you
  have mastered key skills.  The mastery quizzes must be completed
  without the help of others, and ideally without notes.  You can
  re-take these quizzes if needed. -->

<li>This class may be a little large by COA standards. You and
  I will need to work together to make sure that this classtime is
  comfortable and effective, and that outside of class people are able
  to get all the help they need. I have taught other classes with more
  than thirty students and it worked out fine. So I'm not worried. 

<li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
  confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
  sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can offer
  help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know who needs
  it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if you need
  it. On a related note ... 

<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
  with others and seeking help if you need it.  

<li>This class, especially at the beginning, will move fairly quickly
  and there will be a lot of work. This course is about building
  quantitative and analytical skills, and the only way to do this is
  through lots of practice. It is essential that you not fall behind.

<li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be very careful to not fall
  farther behind every week.

<li> I will accept late homework assignments. However, I may
  not grade these assignments thoroughly.  Multiple late
  assignments will result in a lowering of your grade and a mention in
  your narrative evaluation.

<!--<li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
  no higher than a C. -->

<li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
  also consult me, teaching assistants, other faculty, friends, and
  family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
  understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
  problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
  just copy their solution and turn it in. 

<!--<li> During the second part of the course there will be a significant
  emphasis on group projects.  You will be expected to fully
  participate in these projects and reserve Thursday afternoon lab
  time for group meetings during the second half of
  term. Presentations and final reports will be graded per group. To
  encourage sharing the significant workload, each student will
  complete a confidential peer appraisal reviewing each member's
  contribution to the group.   
-->
 
<li> As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email, it is important that you check your email
  regularly. 

<li> Unless we have made arrangements in advance, you are expected to 
  come to class and participate in discussion and group
  exercises.  

<li>Most homework assignemnts will include some problems assigned on
  WeBWorK, an electronic homework platform.  There are several
  benefits to WeBWorK:
<ul>
  <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can learn
    right away from your mistakes.  You can submit solutions many
    times until you get everything correct. 
  <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, the TAs and I can
    spend more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
    grading. 
  <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get slightly
  different versions of the questions. This means that collaborating
  with other students will be maximally effective, since you'll have
  to share solution methods and not just the final answer.  
</ul>     
WeBWorK takes a little getting used to. If you encounter any problems
  with the platform, be sure to ask for help. 

<li>I am in the early stages of writing a book based on   this class.
  I will be writing as the term progresses and sharing updated drafts
  with you.  Although there will inevitably be some typos and
  omissions, I think this will be a useful resource for you.  Feedback
  and suggestions are welcome.  

<!--<li> This class is a lot of work.  It's very important to not fall
  behind.  Doing well on your project will require a significant time 
  investment.  Most of this work will occur weeks 5-10. -->

<li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
  technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
  There is also a temptation to get bogged down in debates about
  policy.  We should collectively resist these temptations; there are
  a lot of important topics to learn about. 

<li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
  institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
  academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
  fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
  make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
  others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
  evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
  his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
  for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
  discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
  scholarship arise."
