I have several main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want you to learn several important and widely used mathematical
ideas and tools:  series, sums, vector functions, and partial
derivatives and their applications.

<li>I want you to gain experience using a computer algebra system to
do mathematics. 

<li>I want to have fun while working hard and learning a lot. 
</ol>
<p><br>

I hope to cover chapters 8-11 of our textbook.  This is similar to the
material covered in most other Calc III courses at colleges and
universities with trimesters or quarters.  It does not complete the
typical calculus sequence.  In particular, we will not cover multiple
integrals and vector calculus.  If students are interested, I would
strongly consider teaching a calculus IV section as a tutorial this
spring to complete the calculus sequence.



<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based roughly on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 90 percent.
<li><b>Class and Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I recommend against grades; I believe they are more likely than not to
interfere with genuine, reflective learning.  However, I will assign
grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines in the COA
Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br> 

<h3>Policies, Advice, and Stuff:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning this
in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your grade.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>Unless students prefer otherwise, I do not plan on giving any
exams in this class.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
no higher than a C.  

<li>You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
trigonometry, and logarithms.  There's no need to buy an expensive
graphing calculator.  

<li>We will be making use of Maple for this class.  Maple is an
extremely powerful mathematics package that can do graphical,
numerical, and symbolic computations.  

<li>I will be sending out class info via email.  Thus, it's important
that you check your email.

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty winter term, 1999.
