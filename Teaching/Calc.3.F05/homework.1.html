<li>Two trains are heading toward each other on a track.  Both trains
move at a constant speed of 10 meters per second.  When the trains
are 200 meters apart a bird who had been sitting on one of the trains
flies toward the other train.  It reaches the other train and
instantly turns around and flies back toward the original
train. Throughout, the bird's speed is 20 meters per second.  The bird
repeats this behavior, flying back and forth between the trains.
Eventually the trains collide, and the bird is crushed.  How far did
the bird fly before it met its tragic demise?
