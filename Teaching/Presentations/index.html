<p>
<br>
Here are some links to guides for giving scientific presentations.  If
there's something else I should add, please let me know.<p><br>

My source for this group of pages was the <a
href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/writing/">home page
for Physics 596</a> at the Ohio State University.  This is a course
taught by <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/">John
Wilkins</a>; the title of the course is <i>Writing and speaking about
physics and astronomy</i>.  Wilkins has lots of great advice about
writing papers and giving presentations.

<ul>
<li><a
href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/writing/Supp/dazzle.html">The
Art of Oral Scientific Presentations</a>.  An excellent set of
advice.  Good place to start.<p>
<li><a
href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~perry/p596/Handouts/talktips.html">Talk
Tips</a>. <p>
<li><a
href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/writing/Handouts/viewgraphs.html">Rules
for Preparing Viewgraphs</a>. <p>
</ul>
<br>

Other guides:<p>

<li><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/wci/hints.html">"Ten
Commandments"</a> for giving a talk from a group of immunologists.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.onr.navy.mil/onr/speak/prep.htm">A kinda long
guide to giving a talk</a> from the Office of Naval Research.  I
haven't read this, so I'm not sure if this is any good or not.<p>

<li><a
href="http://www.io.com/~hcexres/tcm1603/acchtml/oral.html">Oral
Presentations</a>.  Looks like there's a lot of good info here.  It's
not specific to scientific presentations, though.<p>

<li><a href="http://aerg.canberra.edu.au/pub/aerg/edu12min.htm">A
short guide to giving 12 minute talks</a> from somewhere in
Australia.  This look pretty good.<p>

<li><a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~mark/Article.html">A guide to
scientific presentations</a> from somewhere in Japan.  (The guide is
written in english.)<p>
