I have several goals for this course:
<ol>
<li>I want to help you gain experience in and appreciation for a
    variety of different styles and flavors of mathematics. We will do
    a lot of different things in this course, and almost all of them
    should be really fun and interesting.  
    <li>I want you to gain experience working with and critically
    evaluating different mathematical models.  
    <li>I want you to do an in-depth, focused study of a particular
    mathematical model or technique.  
    <li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
    solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
<li>I want to have fun while working hard and learning some
    challenging material.  
</ol>
</td>

<h3>But what is this course really about?</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Several themes will run through all of what we do: order and
      randomness, simplicity and complexity. What do these terms mean?
      What are the relationships between them? 
   <li> What are the different uses of mathematical and computational
      models?  What assumptions are behind different models?  
</ul>


<h3>Text</h3>

Our primary text will be The Computational Beauty of Nature (CBN) by
Gary Flake. Note, however, that CBN isn't a textbook in the normal
sense. It's much more interesting than many texts, and there aren't
problems at the end of each chapter. Although you could get by without
buying a copy, I recommend purchasing one. The paperback edition is
around $30.00. We will also do readings from a variety of other
sources, including several textbooks, web sites, research papers, and
articles.  <p>

At a bare minimum, I expect we'll cover the material in the following
chapters of CBN: 5, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20. Many of these chapters
are fairly brief; we'll 
supplement them with other readings. I also want to spend some time on
graphs and networks. These topics aren't covered in CBN. As time
permits, we may also 
discuss symbolic dynamics, incomputability and incompleteness, 
Mandelbrot and Julia sets, and other things. <p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based loosely on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 45 percent.
<li><b>Week 5 Presentation:</b> 10 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 30 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on page 8 of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  In general, I strongly recommend against grades; I believe
they are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
learning.<p><br>  

<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Complex_Systems.04">
http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Complex_Systems.04</a>. 

<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me likely mentioning
this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your
grade.   

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li> Information on what is expected for your final presentation can be
found <a href="projects.html">in a separate document</a>. 

<li> Information on what is expected in homework solutions can be
found <a href="solutions.html">in a separate document</a>.

<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading before class and come prepared to discuss.

<li> I will have to miss classes on Tuesday September 21 and Tuesday
November 16.  We will discuss how to make up these classes.  

<li>In order to make time for final presentations, we'll need to
schedule a few extra classes toward the end of the term.  I would like
to open up our final presentations to the full COA community.

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
information via email, it is important that you check your email
regularly.  

<li>I expect you to attend class.

<li> We may use the computer algebra system Maple.  If you
haven't learned to love Maple yet, you will soon.  <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Maple">Here is a page with Maple
info</a>. 

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
integrity</a> passed by the faculty several winters ago.
