<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 1 October</b><p>  
<br>

<b>This assignment is not yet complete.  A few short problems will be
added Sunday or Monday.</b><p>


Problem 1 is based very closely on a problem from Daniel Kaplan and
Leon Glass, <i>Understanding Nonlinear dynamics</i>, Springer-Verlag,
1995.  This is an excellent text; I used it the first time I taught
this class.  If you want to learn more about chaos and nonlinear
dynamics, this is a great place to start.<p>


<ol>

<li>The population of a species is described by the equation f(x) = ax
e^(-t), where x >= 0 and a is a positive constant.
<ol>
 
<li>Determine the fixed points.
<li>Evaluate the stability of the fixed points.
<li>For what value of a is the first period-doubling bifurcation?
<li>For what values of a will the population go extinct starting from
any initial condition?
<li>Suppose you were to make a bifurcation diagram for this equation
as a function of a.  What do you think the bifurcation diagram would
look like and why?  Which features of the diagram could you predict,
and which couldn't you?
<li>(<i>optional</i>)Using a computer, generate a bifurcation diagram
as a function of a. <p>
</ol>


<li>Calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the logistic equation
with: 
 <ol>
 <li> r = 2.5
 <li> r = 3.0
 <li> r = 3.2
</ol>
<br>

<li>Determine the fractal dimension of the following shapes.  
<ol>
    <li>The <a href="./sierpinski.gif">Sierpinski triangle</a>.
    (Sierpinski lived from 1882-1969.  Poland put him on a <a
    href="stamp_sierpinski.jpg">stamp</a>.) Here's another view of the
    <a href="./sierp-det.GIF">Sierpinski triangle</a>.
    <li> The <a href="./sierpinski.8.gif">Sierpinski carpet</a>.
    <li> The <a href="./sponge.gif">Menger sponge</a>. 
    <li> The <a href="box.fractal.gif">box fractal</a>.
</ol>


<!--
<li>Using the programs available on my website <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos">here</a>, determine whether
or not the logistic equation is chaotic for r = 3.5699456718695445.
Discuss.
