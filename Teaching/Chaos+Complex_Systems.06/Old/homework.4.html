<b>Homework 4:  Due by the end of the term</b><p>  
<br>



<ol>

<li>Write a brief response to the paper we read by Helmrich.  Do not
summarize the paper; assume your audience has read it.  This
shouldn't be a well-polished essay, but it shouldn't be a rambling
journal entry, either.  Don't try to respond to the all the arguments,
just pick one or two and explore them.  If you're stuck for what to
write on, I suggest picking one particularly provocative passage or
paragraph and analyzing it carefully and critically.  Your response
should be one to two pages.  <p>

<li> Problem 2.6, page 99, from <i>Understanding Nonlinear
Dynamics</i>, on reserve in the library.  <p>

<li>For each of the following elementary one-dimensional CAs, sketch
thirty time steps.  In class we started with a random initial
condition.  For this exercises, start with a single 1 (i.e. a dark
square) and a background of all 0's (all light).  Do these on graph
paper.  
<ol>
<li>Rule 2
<li>Rule 126 (does the shape look familiar?)
<li>Rule 109
<li>A rule of your choosing.<p>
</ol>

<li>As we'll discuss in class, game theory is used to model strategic
interaction.  Come up with some situation that can be formulated as a
two-player game.  Explain the different player's strategies and their
payoffs.  <p>

<li>Consider the Ultimatum Game, as we discussed in class.  Assume
that instead of being given 100 dollars, I'm given only two dollars.
I can offer Chris either 0, 1, or 2 dollars.  Chris can either refuse
or accept.  If he accepts, he gets what I offered him, and I get
what's left over.  If neither of us accept, neither of us get any
money.  Construct a payoff matrix for this game.  Is there a Nash
equilibrium for this game?  In your response, be sure to state what a
Nash equilibrium is.
