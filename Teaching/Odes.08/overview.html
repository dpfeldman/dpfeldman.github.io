<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<br>

There are two equally important goals for this course.
<ul>
  <li>Gain a solid introduction to differential equations: learn what
  differential equations are, be able to formulate original
  mathematical models using differential equations, and be able to use
  a variety of techniques to solve and understand differential
  questions, including numerical and qualitative methods. 
  <li>Gain experience conceptualizing, carrying out, and presenting
  research.  This includes conceptualizing and framing research
  questions and problems, conducing a literature review, presenting
  results in a  professional-style research talk, and writing up
  results in a style appropriate for publication.  
</ul>

<b>Required Text:</b> Belinda Barnes and Glenn R. Fulford.
<i>Mathematical Modelling with Case Studies: A Differential Equation
Approach using Maple</i>. Taylor & Francis.  2002.  ISBN-10:
0-415-29804-0. <p>

<b>Strongly Recommended:</b> Wayne C. Booth, Joseph M. Williams, Gregory
G. Colomb. <i>The Craft of Research, 2nd edition</i>. University Of
Chicago Press. 2003. ISBN-10: 0226065685.  ISBN-13: 978-0226065687.
There is supposedly a third edition coming out in April 2008.  This
book is awesome.  If you plan on doing a final project or any other
sort of research in the next four years, you should buy this book.
</ol>
<p>
I am not certain how much of Barnes and Fulford we will be able to
cover.  I'd like to get through most of Chapters 1-3, 5-7, and 9, but
I don't know how realistic this is.<p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<br>
Your evaluation will be based loosely on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 45 percent.
<li><b>Class and Discussion Participation:</b> 5 percent.
<li><b>Research Project:</b> 50 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on page 8 of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  In general, I recommend against grades; I believe they are
more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
learning.<p><br>  

<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Odes.08"> http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Odes.08</a>.
<li>There will be approximately five required homework assignments.
Chronically late homework assignments may result in me mentioning
this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your 
grade.   

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
and family.  However, the homework you hand in must represent
your own understanding.  

<li> Information on what is expected in homework solutions can be
found <a href="solutions.html">in a separate document</a>.

<li> Information on what is expected for your final presentation can be
found <a href="projects.html">in a separate document</a>. 

<li> The extra Thursday class session will usually be devoted to
discussion of various ideas, topics, and issues concerning research.
Attendance and participation in these sessions is important. 

<li>In order to make time for final presentations, we'll need to
schedule a few extra classes toward the end of the term.  I would like
to open up our final presentations to the full COA community.

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
information via email, it is important that you check your email
regularly.  

<li>I expect you to attend class.  This is more the case than in other
classes of mine.  I'll cover topics in class that aren't in the book,
and there will also be discussion and dialog. 

<li>At times I will assign reading for discussion in an upcoming
class.  It is important 

<li> We will be using the computer algebra system Maple.  If you
haven't learned to love Maple yet, you will soon. 

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
integrity</a> passed by the faculty several winters ago.

href="expectations.html">here</a>.
