describing the math classes you've taken previously.  Be sure to
indicate where you took those classes: high school, COA, another
college.  Feel free to mention any other information about your math
background that might be relevant, interesting, and/or amusing. Also,
please let me know what other courses you expect to take this term,
and if there are some areas (art, policy, education, etc.) in which
you're particularly interested and/or you're focusing while at COA.<p><br>
