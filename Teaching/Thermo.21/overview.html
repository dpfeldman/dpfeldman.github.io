<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ol>
    <li>Stay physically and mentally healthy and maintain intellectual
      and personal connection in a time of dispersal and
      isolation.</li>
    <li>Experience the challenge, joy, and beauty of physics.  I want
      you to gain an understanding and appreciation of the structure and
      style of physics as an intellectual approach and discipline.</li> 
    <li>I want to learn the basic principles and techniques of
      thermodynamics, and be able to apply thermodynamics to problems
      across the sciences. </li>
    <li>Improve your problem solving skills and mathematical
      confidence. Leave this course with an increased ability
      to do mathematics and physics.</li>  
    <li>Have fun while learning a lot. </li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>Course Structure and Pacing</h3>

<p>This is my fourth time teaching this course, so I think I have a
  pretty good feel for how it will go.  But we are in a pandemic, and
  everything is feels different now, so we'll see.
</p>

<p class="no-box">
  There are three parts to this class each with a somewhat different
  feel:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Chapter 1. This will be conservation of energy in various
    guises. Most of this material will be new to you, but it will have
    a familiar feel. </li>
  <li>Chapter 2-3. Here we will encounter entropy and the second law
    of thermodynamics in various guises. This material will be new,
    some of the math will be new, and it will be a bit abstract and
    big-picture. </li>
  <li>Chapter 4-5. Here we will apply all the new stuff from chapters
    2-3 to a wide array of phenomena. This will be the most
    interesting, challenging, and perhaps the most rewarding part of
    the class. </li> 
</ol>
<p>We will cover most of the first four chapters of the text.
</p>


<h3>Class Meetings</h3>
<p><ol>
  <li>This class meets three times a week. The first week we will meet
    on zoom.  After that we will meet in person, with a zoom option.</li>
  <li>I'm not certain how it will be teaching in-person and via zoom
    at the same time, since I haven't taught in this mode before.  It
    will take some trial and error to figure out what works best.  Your
    feedback (and patience) is appreciated.</li>
  <li>Classes will usually run from <b>9:45 - 11:00</b>.  We might
    occasionally end early.</li>
  <li>I strongly encourage you to take handwritten notes.  The
    physical component of taking notes helps to keep you engaged.  And
    taking handwritten notes requires you to do some on-the-fly
    synthesis and prioritization, deepening your understanding.</li>
  <li>During class you will sometimes work in small groups on
    problems. Figuring out the best way to do this on Zoom and
    physically-distanced in-person will take some creativity trial and
    error.</li>  
</ol>
</p>


<h3>Homework</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    physics, and also this is what your evaluation will be based on.</li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first 
    time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
    with others and seeking help if you need it.</li>
  <li>Thoughts on how to approach the homework (and what I'll be
    evaluating you on) can be found
    here: <a href="./solutions.html">thoughts on homework
      solutions</a>.</li> 
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
    check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
  <li>All homework will be posted on the schedule page of this website
    and on our course's google classroom page.  All assignments should
    be submitted via classroom.</li>
  </ol>
</p>


<h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
      phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
      not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
      ever). </li>
    <li>This class is large and there are no teaching assistants.  We
      will have to figure out how optimally schedule help sessions.  I
      suspect this will a week or two to figure this out.</li>
    <li>Some of the problems in this course are multi-step problems
      for which the solution path will not be immediately clear.  Some
      problems may take several pages to work through.  My hope is
      that this is challenging and rewarding.</li>
  </ol>
</p>


<h3>Help Sessions</h3>
<p>
I will have a handful of help sessions every week. You are warmly
invited and encouraged to attend these sessions. I'm planning to offer
both in-person and zoom help sessions. We'll see how this goes.  Help
sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun. Things that happen
at help sessions: 
<ol>
  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
    specific questions.</li>
  <li>We can experiment with breakout rooms for folks who want to work
  together in small groups during the help session.</li>
<!--  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.-->
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>You should also feel free to reach out to me any time with
  questions. If you're stuck on a problem, it might help to take a
  photo of what you've done so far and include it in an email.  I
  might be able to help you with a short email, or we could set up a
  time to meet on zoom.</p> 
      


<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown.
</p>



<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">
Evaluation will be based on the weekly homework assignments.  
  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.  This is an unusual time.
I'd strongly consider taking this class without letter grades.
Perhaps for some of you not having letter grades will reduce anxiety.
I'm happy to talk through options if anyone wants. 
</p>

  
  
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>We will be using the following textbook

<a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/">Daniel V. Schroeder</a>,
  An Introduction to Thermal Physics, Oxford University Press, 2021
(ISBN 978-0192895554). 
The <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/thermal/">webpage for the
  textbook</a> has some useful information, including a list of
errata.  There is an older edition of the book published by
  Addison-Wesley and several international editions.  Any edition will
  work fine. 
</p>

  

<!--  
<h3>Official Syllabus</h3>
<p>
A one-page listing of the topics we'll cover in this course can be
found <a href="./calc1_syllabus_2021.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 4 hr/wk "in" class,
      1 hr/wk on discussion forums, 2 hr/wk reading, 1hr/wk writing
      papers/blog posts, 7 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
