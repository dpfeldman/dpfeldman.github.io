<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box"
<ol>
   <li>I want to help you improve your problem solving skills, and
   mathematical confidence, and overall ability to use mathematics. 
   <li> I want you to understand and know how to use partial
   derivatives, directional derivatives, double and triple integrals,
   and their applications. 
   <li> I want you to gain experience using a computer to help you
   do mathematics. 
   <li> I want you to understand and know how to use the main elements
   of vector calculus: the divergence, gradient, and curl; line and
   surface integrals; and Greens Theorem, Stokes Theorem, and the
   Divergence Theorem. 
   <li> I want you to have fun while working hard and learning a lot. 
</ol>
</p>


<h3>Textbook</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
William McCallum, et al. Calculus: Multivariable, 4th Edition.  J.
Wiley.  2004.  ISBN: 978-0-471-48480-6.

This *not* the most current edition of the book.  The 5th edition came
out around six months ago.  However, the 4th edition is still
available. </p>


<p class="no-box">
In fact, you can get the 4th edition quite cheaply.  New
on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nu6ge2">amazon</a> the book is $111.
They have lots of used ones, however, some as inexpensive as $42. </p>

<p class="no-box">
When ordering the book, but sure that the ISBN is correct.  The ISBN is
different for every edition of a book.  So the ISBN is the best way to
make sure that you are getting the edition and version of the book that
you want.  Note that this can be especially tricky for Calculus, as
there are many different versions of the book (multi-variable,
single-variable, etc) written by the same authors, and there are also
multiple editions of each.  Use the ISBN, however, and you can't go
wrong.
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>


<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 90 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>


<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 

<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
   <li> Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day. More than
   one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning
   this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of
   your grade. 
   <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
   can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends, and
   family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
   understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
   problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
   photocopy their solution and turn it in. 
   <li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a
   grade no higher than a C. 
   <li> Unless students prefer otherwise, I do not plan on giving any
     exams in this class. If there is time, however, I would like to
     give a final, synthetic problem set. 
   <li> You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
     trigonometry, and logarithms. There's no need to buy an expensive
     graphing calculator. 
   <li>We will be making use of two computer platforms for doing
    mathematics, sage and WolframAlpha.  More about these soon.  We
    will not use Maple.

  <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
    important that you check your email. 
  <li> Academic misconduct&mdash;cheating, plagarizing, etc.&mdash;is
    bad.  Any cases of academic misconduct may result in a judicial
    hearing. Possible consequences range from failure of the
    assignment to expulsion. 
<!--  <li>Here is some additional information on what is expected for
  homework solutions. -->

  can be found <a href="./description.html">here</a>.
