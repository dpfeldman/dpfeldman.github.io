\noindent This is a small warm-up assignment.  The main goal is for
you to start getting used to the WeBWorK system.  You can access
WeBWorK here:
\url{https://courses1.webwork.maa.org/webwork2/coa-es10341/}.  There
is also a link to WeBWorK on the bottom of the schedule page on the
course website.  The assignment to do is called Homework Zero.\\

\noindent If you encounter any problems with WeBWorK, please let me
know. \\

\noindent Most assignments will combine WeBWorK and written work, but
this warm-up assignment is all online.
