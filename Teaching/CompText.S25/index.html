      <p><b>Computational text analysis</b> (CTA) is an emerging field that
      uses computation to analyze texts. CTA draws on the fields of
      computer science, machine learning, computational linguistics,
      and literary theory. Using machine learning and statistics,
      computers can be used to explore how language is used in
      particular contexts, including how frequently different words
      are used, the sentiment of a word/text, as well as nuances in
      the ways words are associated with one another. We will use CTA
      to engage in "Distant Reading", a term coined by literary
      theorist Franco Moretti. Distant Reading stands in contrast to
      the more familiar "Close Reading": a deep engagement with a
      particular text or a passage from a text. Distant Reading
      engages not with a particular text, but with a large corpus of
      texts: e.g., all novels published in English in the 20th
      century, all articles written in The New York Times and The
      Washington Post in the last decade, or the lyrics of all top-100
      pop songs from the 1980s. Computational techniques applied to
      large collections of texts allow one to ask broad questions
      about structural and linguistic change over time and to look for
      patterns of language use that would not be evident from analysis
      of one or even several individual texts. Distant Reading, and
      computational text analysis more generally, is not intended to
      replace close reading, but to complement it. We will use CTA to
      explore how power structures and systems such as race, gender,
      and colonialism manifest themselves in bodies of text.</p>

    <!-- Axioms Section -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-64 w3-large" id="axioms">
      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician <a href="https://fardila.com/" target="_blank">Federico
	  Ardila-Mantilla</a> has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are
	(slightly re-written to apply to physics as well as math): 
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical and physics potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math and physics experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math and physics are powerful, malleable tools that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.

      <h1>More Course Info and Advice</h1>
      <h3>Structure and Pacing</h3>
<p>
This is my fourteenth time teaching this course, so I have a pretty good 
sense of how it will go.

There are four parts to this class (corresponding to the first four
chapters in the textbook), each with a distinct feel: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Review of functions.</b> This may seem both too slow and too
    fast at the same time. The last week of this part of the class is
    always difficult. Experience has shown, however, that the review of 
    functions is definitely worth it. It is essential for the rest of
    the course.</li>
  <li><b>Introduction to the derivative.</b> Here we will learn what
    the derivative is and what it means. This is more conceptual and
    sometimes seems odd to those used to less conceptual and more
    algebraic ways of thinking about math.</li>
  <li><b>Techniques of differentiation.</b> Having learned what the
    derivative is, we now learn lots of short cuts to calculate
    it. This part of the class is the most traditional, in that you'll
    learn some formulas and techniques, and then do lots of practice
    of those techniques. </li>
  <li><b>Applications of derivatives.</b> Here we will learn several
    different ways derivatives get used. This is the most applied part
    of the course. It is somewhat more difficult, but most students find
    it the most interesting, too, and a good way to end the class.</li>
</ol>
</p>
      <p>There are two lab sections for the course. You should
	attend one lab session each week. Please attend the same lab each
	week if possible, but if not, it's not a big deal.</p>
      
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Stuff about Homework (and other Assignments)</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be an assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
	  essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
	  math, and also this is most of what your evaluation will be based
	  on.</li> 
	<li>There will be two parts to almost every homework assignment:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
	    <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	      google classroom</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. There are three
	  reasons why I use WeBWorK:
	  <ul>
	    <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	      learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	      many times until you get everything correct.</li>
	    <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	      slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	      collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	      since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	      final answer. </li>
	    <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
	      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	      grading.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
	  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
	  with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li><b>You can always re-submit work without penalty</b>.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
	<li><b>In addition to weekly homework, there will be a few
	larger, synthetic, and hopefully creative and fun
	assignments. There may also be one or two short, un-timed,
	open-notes exam-like assignments.</b></li> 
	<li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
	  phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
	  not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
	  ever). </li>
      </ol>
      </p>


      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email.  There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for energy projects on campus
	    or in the community.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the
	TAs. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>What your Evaluation is Based on</h3>
      
      <p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
	assignments (approx 70%) and your lab assignments and
	exam-like assignments (approx 30%). I think there is much to
	be said against grades; I believe they often interfere with
	genuine, reflective learning. But I am happy to assign grades
	if you wish. I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc. 
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
      <p>It is my intent that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
	Hill or Associate Dean Kourtney Collum.
      </p>

      <h3>Gender-based discrimination: Title IX</h3>

      <p>COA is dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive
      campus where all community members have equal access to COA’s
      educational and employment opportunities. We strive to promote
      an environment of respect, safety, and well-being and will not
      tolerate gender-based or sexual discrimination nor sexual
      harassment of any kind. </p>

      <p>As a faculty member, I am considered a “responsible employee”
      and am required to share any disclosures of sexual or
      gender-based misconduct with the Title IX Coordinator. This
      includes disclosures of experiences that happened before an
      individual’s time at COA. This is to ensure that all community
      members who have experienced sexual misconduct receive support,
      options, and information about their rights and
      resources. Community members are not obligated to respond to
      this outreach, and this will not generate a report to law
      enforcement. </p>

      <p>For more information regarding Title IX, our institutional policy,
	and to access helpful resources, visit COA’s Title IX website:
	<a href="https://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix" target="_blank">https://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix</a>.</p> 

      <p>If you have any questions or want to explore support and
	assistance, please contact COA’s Title IX Coordinator,
	Puranjot Kaur, at pkaur@coa.edu. Speaking to the Title IX
	Coordinator does not automatically initiate a college
	resolution. Instead, much of her work is around providing
	supportive measures to ensure you can continue to engage in
	COA’s programs and activities.</p>
      
      <p><b>Note on Pregnancy and Related Conditions:</b></p>
      
      <p>Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in education
	programs and activities. This prohibition on discrimination extends
	to pregnancy and related conditions. Pregnancy and related
	conditions encompass pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, termination
	of pregnancy, false pregnancy, lactation, or recovery from any of
	these conditions. </p> 
      
      <p>Students experiencing pregnancy or related conditions may
	voluntarily initiate contact with the Title IX Coordinator to
	request reasonable adjustments available under Title IX. Reasonable
	adjustments may include but are not limited to: excusing student
	absences; allowing students to make up missed work; opportunities to
	move around during class; additional breaks; missing some or all of
	a class session to nurse or pump, and to have the opportunity to
	make up any work missed. Information on lactation space on campus
	can be found here:
	<a href="http://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix/support-resources/lactation-space"
	   target="_blank">http://www.coa.edu/human-resources/title-ix/support-resources/lactation-space</a>.</p> 
      
      <p>Students who believe they have been subject to discrimination
	because of pregnancy or related condition status may file a
	formal complaint with the Title IX Coordinator. If you are a
	pregnant or parenting student, and you are in need of any
	adjustments. please let me know at your earliest
	convenience.</p> 
      
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      
      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</li>
	    
	  <li>I am also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you'll spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </li> 
	</ul></p>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important to
      acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p>
