FA-23,"Altair Ferreira, Thiago",ES,1018,I,Physics I:  Mechanics and Energy,ES QR,TRUE,40,1,"This course is the first of a two course sequence covering a range of standard introductory physics topics. The goals of the course are: to introduce students to important physical ideas both conceptually and mathematically; and to help students improve their quantitative skills. The first part of the course consists of a broad look at the three conservation laws: the conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum.  Along the way, we'll learn about vectors, work, potential energy, thermal energy, and the energy stored in chemical bonds. We'll conclude with a treatment of Newton's laws of motion.  If time permits, we may briefly cover some topics from chaotic dynamics.  Evaluations will be based on participation in class and lab, weekly homework, and two untimed, open-notes exams. This course makes extensive use of algebra and trigonometry. Potentially difficult math topics will be reviewed as necessary. Prerequisites: Understanding Functions, a strong high school algebra background, or consent of the instructor.

FA-23,"Anderson, John",MD,1022,I,Working the Sea,,TRUE,100,1,"For much of the past 5000 years the sea has played a major role in a broad variety of human cultures, histories, arts, and economies.  Sea-faring peoples have developed a rich lore and technology that allows them to both survive and even thrive in an often hostile element. This course will mix practical, hands-on learning of aspects of seamanship with a survey of fiction and non-fiction that address maritime themes.  During the early part of the term we will concentrate on aspects of small-boat handling, using the College’s inflatables, rowing boats, and the larger research vessels, Osprey and Laughing Gull.  Students will learn how to launch and land small-craft from docks and beaches, basic rowing skills and use of an outboard motor. They will learn essential knots useful aboard ship and on the dock, how to lay out a course using a chart and compass, use of GPS and depth sounders, basic Rules of the Road, and elements of celestial navigation.  During some lab periods we will go on short voyages in the general area of Frenchman Bay. As the term proceeds and weather worsens, we will turn to an increasingly greater literary component, reading accounts of famous voyages and local fishermen, discoveries, battles, legends and poetry.  Possible texts include, but are not limited to: Working the Sea by Wendell Seavey, Master and Commander by Patrick O’ Brian, Maiden Voyage by Tania Aebi, The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger, In the Heart of The Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, Longitude by Dava Sobel, Slave Ship: A Human History by Marcus Rediker, Kon Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl, We Didn’t Mean to Go To Sea by Arthur Ransome as well as excerpts from The Greenlanders’ Saga, Moby Dick, The Old Man and the Sea, The Voyage of the Beagle, and Two Years Before the Mast. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, a number of short “quizzes” – which will include practical elements - and a term paper focusing on one aspect of working the sea.

FA-23,"Anderson, John",ES,3014,M,Ecology,ES,TRUE,75,1,"This course examines ecology in the classic sense: the study of the causes and consequences of the distribution and abundance of organisms. We examine the assumptions and predictions of general models of predator-prey interactions, inter- and intra-species competition, island biogeography, and resource use, and compare these models to the results of experimental tests in lab and field. In addition we discuss appropriate techniques used by ecologists in collecting data in the field, note-taking and the appropriate collation and storage of field data. Although this course is NOT a course in Conservation Biology, we examine how ecological principles are applied to conservation questions.  Readings include selections from the primary literature. Students are evaluated on the basis of class participation and two in depth problem sets,drawing extensively on the primary literature.

FA-23,"Andrews, Nancy",AD,1019,I,Four-Dimensional Studio,ADS,TRUE,30,1,"This class gives students an opportunity to investigate time-based art.  4-D art draws on the vast and varied traditions of theatre, dance, media, and music, often crossing boundaries to create hybrid works.  This course will focus on concepts and processes related to representing and experiencing events that take place in time.  Strategies for planning, proposing, and producing work individually or collaboratively will be discussed and practiced.  Some class periods will be workshop in style, and include physical and vocal exercises and improvisations.  The course will include basic instruction and use of video cameras and sound recording devices.  A majority of the learning in this studio course will happen as students make projects and reflect on their work and the work of others.  Documentation and information about contemporary and historic time-based art will be presented.  Students will be evaluated based on imaginative exploration of ideas and materials, extent and depth of work processes and research, completion of assigned projects, and participation in class discussions.

FA-23,"Andrews, Nancy",AD,3014,M,Soundscape,ADS,TRUE,60,1,"Soundscape may be defined as an environment of sound (or sonic environment) with emphasis on the way it is perceived and understood by the individual, or by a society. It thus depends upon the relationship between the individual and any such environment. The term may refer to actual environments, or to abstract constructions such as musical compositions and tape montages, particularly when considered as an artificial environment. In this interdisciplinary course we investigate a broad range of acoustic concepts, ranging from a scientific treatment of the nature and behavior of sound both in air and underwater, the biology of hearing, the use of sound by animals in communication, and the cultural applications of sound and music in human society. Students will explore methods of composition using sounds as materials for assigned projects. Various approaches to understanding and experiencing sound will be examined, including spoken word, radio shows, music, and experimental forms. Labs will focus on understanding the nature of sound, and practical application of sound equipment, technique and theory. Students will learn about microphones, sound recording, amplification, and the physics of sound. The course will culminate in a performance to the community of student presentations that expresses the wide use of sound as part of our culture. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a set of assignments, including a final project. Emphasis will be placed on an artistic interpretation of soundscape, although students will be expected to have a basic understanding of the scientific basis of acoustic phenomena.

FA-23,"Baker, Laurie",ES,1085,I,Data Science I: Visualization,QR,TRUE,0,1,"How can one summarize information and data and convey its meaning to others? What is an effective data visualization? What is an ineffective or dishonest one? And, for that matter, what is data? This course will explore these questions by introducing students to the broad field of information visualization. Students will learn about different types of visualizations that may be used to explore variation and covariation, the evolution of processes through time and space, and representing parts of a whole. Much of the work of this course will be carried out using computers and the R programming language, but we will also explore non-computational approaches to visualization. Students will develop skills in data collection, data cleaning, and creating different types of data visualizations (e.g. bar charts, scatter plots, density plots, heat maps, violin plots, time series, and interactive graphics) and effective data communication while working on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions. We will also critique and reflect upon data visualizations in our daily lives. Students will also gain familiarity with descriptive statistics and ways to organize and summarize categorical and numerical data to pick out key information.  

This course is designed to serve as an introduction to programming in R. Students will learn to gain insight from data, to use literate programming and version control so that these insights are reproducible by others, and to develop code collaboratively. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to work with large data sets, transform those data, and implement effective visualizations. Throughout the course we will be using GitHub, ggplot2, Rmarkdown, gganimate, RShiny and the tidyverse packages for data manipulation. This course is intended to appeal to a wide range of students. The skills and habits of mind taught in this course are applicable not only in the sciences and social sciences, but in almost all fields. Evaluation will be based on several short homework and lab assignments, participation in in-class activities, and a final project.

FA-23,"Cass, Blake",HS,4102,MA,Methods of Tutoring Writing Across the Curriculum,W,TRUE,0,1,"The roles and responsibilities of a writing tutor are evershifting. As writing studies scholar Toni-Lee Capossela tells us, a tutor will at various times be “a reader, a respondent, a questioner, a critic, a listener, a friend, a colleague, a collaborator, or a guide.” By presenting a range of writing center theories and research, this course will give students theoretical knowledge and practical tutoring strategies that will enable them to make informed choices when working with developing writers across different disciplines and conventions. Topics include negotiating the priorities of a tutoring session, differentiating between and responding to the needs of global and small-scale revision, motivational scaffolding, and understanding the often recursive nature of the writing process. Additionally, students will be exposed to active learning strategies and concepts such as cognitive load theory, the zone of proximal development, embodied cognition, and the affective domain. In the first part of the term, students will put their practical and theoretical knowledge into use by conducting one-on-one tutoring sessions with their classmates. During the second half of the term, students will collaborate with experienced tutors, and by week 8 they will begin to tutor on their own. Students will write two major essays–the first a literacy narrative, the second an expository essay on a writing center topic of their choosing.

Level: Intermediate/Advanced.  Prerequisites: Students need to have a commitment to writing and a demonstrated ability to write successfully for college classes.

FA-23,"Clinger, Catherine",AD,1041,I,Art Since 1900: Harmony and Conflict,AD HY,TRUE,50,2,"The artworks of Pablo Picasso and Hannah Höch; both the well-known and lesser-known artist made paintings and sculptures that facilitate our understanding of how people experienced the twentieth century. Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Constructivism, Arte Povera, Social Realism, among others — these artist movements were initiated through group declarations of common aesthetic purpose. Variance within artist conventions and procedures accelerated during moments of unrest and social progression thus providing a range of counter-narratives to canonical histories of the period. The last quarter of the twentieth century was one in which new discourses informed creative production and art mono-cultures gave way to intersectional experience. Theories advanced by Edward Said, Frantz Fanon, Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, and Judith Butler offered new networks with which to understand how art operates as both a reflection and critique of culture. This art history survey looks at how different artists engaged with theories of the unconscious, radical political programs, social upheaval, gender politics, and scientific advances; and, how diverse receptions of human experience were expressed through artistic production. Anxiety, joy, curiosity, and activist predilection combine to formulate a rich amalgam of fresh and challenging visions of the world. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, reading notes, a descriptive analysis, and final essay.

FA-23,"Clinger, Catherine",AD,5032,A,Advanced Studio Printmaking,ADS,TRUE,200,1,"This art studio course is a continuation of the introductory course Studio Printmaking. A print mirrors the surface of its matrix and presents a reflection of the physical and/or immaterial realms of objects and ideas. Representing concepts clearly in any medium requires an artist to engage in thoughtful collaboration with materials in order to realize the potential of form as a means of expression. This advanced studio course will explore ways to address this aesthetic challenge through printmaking by experimenting with conventional and non-traditional ways of creating a range of matrices. Students will acquire skills as printmakers with an emphasis on multiple-plate, collagraph, and other advanced techniques. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the history of prints; how they have functioned to communicate, document, and transmit information through images on paper – engaging with more complex discourses of representation. Students will be evaluated on their projects, participation in critiques, level of engagement with materials, ability to work in a collaborative studio, and final project.

FA-23,"Cox, Gray",HS,3121,M,Current Trends in AI: Problems and Projects,HS,TRUE,35,1,"This course explores the nature of current developments in artificial intelligence and how they present challenges and opportunities in ways they are transforming the world. We will adopt a broad definition of AI that includes everything from simple thermostats to the most advanced machine learning systems and we will look at ways these are altering life processes in the natural world and institutions throughout society. 
 
Course goals are: 1.) to advance understandings of different programming principles, research and development strategies and underlying philosophical assumptions guiding development in such technologies; 2.) to develop abilities to use interdisciplinary[, problem centered approaches to understand the distinctions between complicated and wicked problems associated with rapid technological change in this area and key approaches to dealing with them; 2.) to cultivate skills in working collaboratively on problem-centered studies as well as programming projects that deal with AI in areas of student interest, 4.) to develop meta-cognitive abilities to learn these kinds of material in groups as well as on your own.  
       
A major part of the course for each student will be a term project which can be pursued either individually or collaboratively. It may take a variety of forms including, for instance: 1.) a ?F?utures ?S?tudies investigation using methods of historical and/or social science research culminating in a report on some emerging, AI-related social or environmental concern;  2.) a computer programming project that solves a practical problem, is conducive to artistic expression, performs scientific analysis of quantitative data, or demonstrates an established or experimental feature of an ML or otherwise AI system; 3.)  a philosophical and/or theoretical critical analysis of underlying concepts, values or assumptions that are at stake in the emerging AI technologies. 
       
Readings will include some classic texts in AI theory, philosophy, and futures studies as well as selections from standard texts on AI programming. We will also use podcasts, films, and other media to pursue key topics and trends. There will be a series of short programming activities to study basic principles and try modeling aspects of more complicated and/or complex systems. These will be done, at least initially, in block coding which will be accessible to students without any previous programming experience and which allows people to see how this translates into other languages such as C or Python.[ We will examine the ways in which they can be coded in Python and students familiar with that or other languages will be able to pursue homework and final project work in whatever language they may prefer. We will also explore methods of prompt engineering for working with emerging systems that have dialogical interfaces. 
 
The course will include two weekly class sessions as well as a lab. Class sessions will vary in format from extended discussion of texts and problems to supplementary lecture, visiting speaker, collaborative coding activities and extended project work. The class as a group will develop at least one major hackathon style project as a way of exploring key issues and developing key skills.  
       
Evaluation will be based on the extent to which students demonstrate in homework, class participation and individual projects that they have advanced in each of the four main goals for the course.

FA-23,"Feldman, David",ES,1026,I,Introduction to Chaos and Fractals,ES QR,TRUE,10,1,"This course presents an elementary introduction to chaos and fractals.  The main focus will be on using discrete dynamical systems to illustrate many of the key phenomena of chaotic dynamics: stable and unstable fixed and periodic points, deterministic chaos, bifurcations, and universality.  A central result of this study will be the realization that very simple non-linear equations can exhibit extremely complex behavior.  In particular, a simple deterministic system (i.e., physical system governed by simple, exact mathematical rules) can behave in a way that is unpredictable and random, (i.e., chaotic).  This result suggests that there are potentially far-reaching limits on the ability of science to predict certain phenomena.  Students in this class will also learn about fractals---self-similar geometric objects---including the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.  We will also read about and discuss the development of the field of chaos.  In so doing, we will examine the nature of scientific communities, with a particular eye toward how changes in scientific outlooks occur.  Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to explore the relations between chaos, fractals, and other areas of study such as literature, art, and cultural studies.  Students who successfully complete this class should gain a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the basic ideas of chaos and fractals, a greater understanding of the cultural practice of science, and improved mathematical skills.

Additionally, this course will be useful for those interested in energy and climate policy, either internationally or domestically.  We will begin with a quick overview of current CO2 emissions levels and look at how this is related to energy use.  We will then turn our attention to basic ideas from physics, including the definition of energy and the difference between energy and power.  The bulk of the course will consist of a survey of different forms of energy consumption and generation.  Throughout, we will quantitatively analyze technology from both a local and global point of view.  For example, we will calculate how much electricity one can generate on a rooftop, and we will also examine the role that solar PV could play toward the goal of eliminating fossil fuel use worldwide.  In a unit on financial mathematics, students will learn about the time value of money and several ways of quantifying investments, including ROI (return on investment) and IRR (internal rate of return).  Students will apply these financial tools in several short case studies.

With a rich maritime heritage, local farms, traditional culture, and tight knit community this Japanese island has many parallels with Mount Desert Island. In addition, Osakikamijima's aging population, depopulation, and isolation, also mimics the opportunities and challenges faced by much of Japan. 

The class begins in Hiroshima, where students will explore the tragic modern history of Hiroshima, as well as the 1500-year-old Miyajima shrine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Once on Osakikamijima, we place local knowledge and experiences at the center of the course with students immersing themselves in activities to spark their curiosity in Japanese island life and the natural environment. Students will engage with Japanese culture and language by interacting with island residents. To support their connection to community members, students will study beginner-level Japanese throughout their time on Osakikamijima. These ties will be reinforced with local travel and explorations as well as community members participating as workshop instructors and classroom guest speakers. To build familiarity with the island and the intersection of the natural and human worlds, students will conduct terrestrial and aquatic microplastics research. Further interaction between students and the community will be promoted with weeklong “micro-internships” at a variety of food systems and other enterprises working in harmony with the natural environment. At the conclusion of the program, students will give short presentations to the community showing what has made the strongest impression on them during their time here, and how it could be used to draw in the people to help Osakikamijima survive.

Students will be evaluated based on their performance, participation and the quality of the assignments they produce over the course of the term including: class participation; a video montage; verbal presentations; reflection papers; and a final project presentation to the community.

Similarly, you probably expect this course description to include certain information about the course rather than tips for becoming a viral sensation on TikTok. Why do these differences exist? What is the point of knowing the differences? And how is this relevant to writing?

In this course, you will explore different kinds of writing (genres) to understand how the context shapes the way we write. The explorations of various everyday, academic, and professional genres will help refine the rhetorical skills that you already have and develop your awareness of how writing is used in different contexts. The goal is to build your knowledge of writing and make your repertoire of languages and literacies visible so you can transfer these skills and write in other courses and non-academic settings.

The class activities will provide you with many hands-on opportunities to explore and analyze writing in a collaborative setting with your peers in small and large group activities. You will complete inquiry-based projects to examine different genres and reflect on your evolving understanding of writing. Your learning will be evaluated based on these assignments and activities. By the end of the course, you will have developed the language to talk about writing and built the skills, agency, and confidence to engage in different kinds of writing activities in academia and beyond.

But what do we mean by “nature,” and what distinguishes a natural environment from a social one? Moreover, what kinds of relationships should we cultivate with our natural environments? This discussion-based course explores the concepts of nature and environmental responsibility across different philosophical and cultural frameworks. We will draw on a variety of readings from environmental ethics, ecofeminism, deep ecology, American transcendentalism, indigenous studies, queer theory, and Buddhism. We will read selections from thinkers such as John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ramachandra Guha, Aldo Leopold, Arne Naess, Val Plumwood, Vandana Shiva, Gary Snyder, Henry David Thoreau, Eduardo Kohn, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Thich Nhat Hanh, Anna Tsing, and others. 

Guiding questions include the following: What is nature? How is the idea of nature politicized and socially constructed? Do we have moral obligations to nature? How should humans relate to nature? What assumptions drive the conceptual distinction between humans and nature? Although this course will focus primarily on theoretical questions, we will also discuss issues in applied ethics such as, control over natural resources, wilderness preservation, sustainability, and consumption. Throughout the course, we will revisit questions pertaining to environmental activism, and we will consider how philosophy can help us to articulate our ethical responsibilities and obligations.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions.  This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets.

This course explores ecological “readings” of cities, landscapes transformed irrevocably due to human activities and the introduction of unprecedented concentrations of “unnatural” substances and significant loss of biological and hydrological integrity. The course also examines processes by which cities have transformed surrounding regional landscapes as both “wells” of resources and “sinks” for waste and the planetary scale environmental impacts of urban growth in the contemporary global economy. Following a succinct historical survey in the first part of the class (with focus on the interrelated forces of industrialization, colonization and explosive urban growth in the nineteenth century), we will look to recent efforts to reimagine cities such that they are more “ecological.” These efforts come in a variety of forms from “city as refugia” (establishing habitat for nonhumans) to “novel ecosystems” (working with new concentrations of contaminants and colonization of non-native biological communities) to cities as settings in which closed-loop, ecologically inspired systems drive processes of development. Of concern related to all of these ecological urbanisms is that conversion of city landscapes from grey to green and blue can lead to ever greater levels of inequality. In the final section of the course, we will speculate as to ways to intervene in cities-as-ecosystems that build on commitments to both social justice and ecological replenishment, bringing into relation the flourishing of humans and nonhumans in urbanized environments.

FA-23,"Rand, Kendra",HS,1094,I,Public Speaking Workshop,,TRUE,0,1,"Consider all the ways that public speaking could be a part of your academic and professional paths: presenting your research, sitting on a webinar panel, speaking up at ACM, advocating for an urgent cause or policy, preparing your senior project presentation, delivering a formal address at a special occasion, or even deciding to perform spoken word at an open-mic. This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.  Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly.  This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations  while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for  public communication.  Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits.  The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other.  This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches.  Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation.  All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course.  This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches.

FA-23,"Tai, Bonnie",ED,3107,M,Culturally Sustaining and Revitalizing Education,HS ED,TRUE,25,1,"This course is designed for students planning to teach in schools whether in Maine or outside of the United States. Culturally sustaining/revitalizing education (CSRE) builds on the aims, values, insights, and practices of anti-racist education, culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, culturally sustaining/revitalizing pedagogy, decolonizing education, global education, intercultural education, and multicultural education. In particular, it aims to contextualize education in the history of colonization, land theft, slavery, the continued struggle for sovereignty and self-determination of native tribes and First Nations, and calls for wider community accountability. This educational approach challenges deficit mindsets and structures that undergird policies and practices that widen the opportunity gap and equitable access to basic human and civil rights and impede educational access for sustaining and revitalizing cultures that settler colonialism has attempted to eliminate, assimilate, or marginalize. Students will practice asset-based and growth mindsets to gain an understanding of the relationship between CSRE and respect for tribal sovereignty and support of contemporary struggles for tribal continuity and resistance to cultural genocide and epistemicide. The course also opens a dialogue on the applicability of CRSE for immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking students whose relationship to their new place of residence may be tenuous at best and whose heritage languages and cultures are also endangered as a result of first- to second-generation assimilation in their adopted communities. Students will gain an understanding of conceptual frameworks, knowledge of empirical studies documenting outcomes and impacts of these approaches, and skills in ethically and effectively teaching indigenous, immigrant, and other culturally and linguistically diverse learners. For students seeking Maine teaching endorsements, this course will prepare them to implement LD291 requiring Maine educators to teach Wabanaki history and culture. Students will learn through field trips, guest speakers, films, discussions, critical exploration and reflection, independent research, observation/fieldwork/practicum, and peer teaching. Evaluation will include artifacts to be incorporated into a teaching portfolio: a lesson plan, teaching video, self-assessment, assessment of PK-12 student work, and communication with families and community members.

FA-23,"Taneja, Palak",HS,2110,IM,"College Seminar: Barbed Wires, Drawn Lines",W HS,TRUE,0,1,"How many times have you mused about the idea of borders? What do the lines that divide us mean, and how are we to make sense of them? Literature has always been a place where questions like these have been thought aloud. Whether the borders are geographical or metaphorical, whether they keep people out or fence people in, borders are liminal spaces that raise questions about politics, oppression, belongingness, and identity, which makes them an important subject for our interrogation. Since these literatures are born of political events, our first concern will be to understand the history of the events themselves. We will achieve that by reading excerpts from the works of Gyanendra Pandey, Stanley Waterman, Joe Cleary, and others in juxtaposition with literature. In addition, the literary works by Saadat Hasan Manto, Seamus Deane, Gloria Anzaldúa, and the like will help put the bigger picture in perspective bringing in various thematic concerns like religion, violence, language, and gender together. This class will thus explore two types of borders: one that course texts evoke, helping you critically engage with the theme. The other kind exists between various genres you will encounter like short stories, novels, literary theory, official reports, and movies. The latter, coupled with your writing assignments that we will workshop throughout the term—personal narrative, online article, movie review, multimodal project, and others—will facilitate and deepen your understanding not only of literature from the borders but also writing as a process—prewriting, writing, and rewriting.

FA-23,"van Vliet, Netta",HS,3061,M,Postcolonial Islands,HS,TRUE,10,1,"This course focuses on islands – geopolitically and conceptually – to consider the significance of postcolonial difference for contemporary political questions about representation, violence, exile and diaspora, climate change, poverty, racialization and sexuality. Islands have long been imagined as sites of fantastic possibility and power, as places of refuge and respite as well as places of horror and dread. They are places imagined as home to cannibals and monsters, but also as idyllic vacations spots and safe havens for shipwrecked sailors. Etymologically, the word island carries with it the meaning of both land and water, and islands are defined as fragments of a whole, and simultaneously as whole unto themselves, raising questions about binaries and boundaries between self and other and about the conceptual topographies of territory, land and water, thresholds between here and there. Islands have been sites ripe for colonial ventures, understood as isolated, insular and susceptible to translation and appropriation but also as resistant, bounded and singular, fertile sites of diversity. Islands have also been significant in religious understandings of them as sites for communion with God or as final places of burial. This course will examine islands in these terms as they have been articulated in the literary imagination, in postcolonial studies and ethnography, and in political theory. Drawing on examples such as Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, J.M. Coetzee’s Foe, The Odyssey, Plato’s Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Octave Mannoni’s Prospero and Caliban, Aime Cesaire’s A Tempest, as well as on ethnography in Island Studies (including classic ethnography such as Malinowski’s Trobriand Islands, and recent scholarship such as “The Island Studies Journal” and A World of Islands), we will consider questions about political representation, language and translation, religious, ethnic and sexual difference, the definition of the human, mobility and sovereignty, resistance and domination. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, in-class participation, reading responses, one short analytical essay, and a final exploratory research project that examines Mt.

She was a giant of a public intellectual and contemporizing figure in American Literature; her works continue to inspire and transform readers and scholars of all identities although her primary purpose was to write for black people. As Morrison herself said, ""If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it."" In writing she changed the literary landscape of the US. In particular, her poetics illustrate how African-American and especially African-American women authors express depths of meaning and experience absolutely central to any understanding of the complex culture and histories of the US. Another Morrison quote hints at the profundity of her own view of her life's work: ""We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives."" These two quotes provide a framework for the course, which seeks students interested in language and its power, literature and its insights, and the black female experience. Over the course of the term students will read through Morrison’s oeuvre of novels (The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, Love, A Mercy, Home, God Help the Child) as well as a number of her key essays and addresses (Playing in the Dark, The Source of Self-Regard), scholarly criticism, and responses to Morrison's 2019 passing. There may be some division of labor with the later novels (after Paradise), but the course is reading intensive. Students will also prepare frequent short written responses and a final project responding to Morrison in some way. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, passage analysis, and the final Morrison project to be shared with the class.

FA-23,"Waldron, Karen",HS,2017,IM,City/Country: Literary Landscapes 1860-1920,HS,TRUE,0,1,"This class focuses on American fiction from the realist/naturalist period (roughly 1860-1920), a time when enormous changes were occurring in and on the American landscape.  Increasing urbanization, immigration, and industrialization corresponded both with a desire for 'realistic' fiction of social problems, and nostalgic stories of a more 'realistic' rural life.  For the first time there was a national literature, resulting from the capabilities of large publishing houses, urban centers and mass production - but this national literature was acutely self-conscious of regional differences, and especially of the tension between city and country.  As writers tried to paint the American landscape in literature, their works subsumed major social issues to place and formal arguments about the true nature of realistic description.  Examining works that portray factory towns, urban tenements, midwestern prairies, New England villages, and the broad spectrum of American landscapes, we look at how a complex, turbulent, multi-ethnic, and simultaneously urban and rural American culture defined itself, its realism, and thus its gender, class, race, and social relations and sense of values, against these landscapes.

We will move between scientific evidence and mythological accounts for large and small scale phenomena ranging from ocean and earth tides, spawning, menstruation, plant growth and development to the lives of the moon and sun gods, moon shots, and the past and present moon-based praxis informing subsistence and capitalist cultures.  We will examine how these two ways of knowing are and are not commensurate through the challenge of designing a scientific study to test the effects of the moon on radish germination and growth over one lunar cycle. The aim of the study will be to simultaneously conduct the measurements by COA alumni around the world. Evaluations will be based on a lunar journal beginning with winter solstice, a compilation of stories and myths accompanied by reflections on the role of the moon within their spatial and cultural context, participation in class discussion and exercises, and a final project with an oral and written component.

Similarly, you probably expect this course description to include certain information about the course rather than tips for becoming a viral sensation on TikTok. Why do these differences exist? What is the point of knowing the differences? And how is this relevant to writing?

In this course, you will explore different kinds of writing (genres) to understand how the context shapes the way we write. The explorations of various everyday, academic, and professional genres will help refine the rhetorical skills that you already have and develop your awareness of how writing is used in different contexts. The goal is to build your knowledge of writing and make your repertoire of languages and literacies visible so you can transfer these skills and write in other courses and non-academic settings.

The class activities will provide you with many hands-on opportunities to explore and analyze writing in a collaborative setting with your peers in small and large group activities. You will complete inquiry-based projects to examine different genres and reflect on your evolving understanding of writing. Your learning will be evaluated based on these assignments and activities.

Is there a scientific method? Can science tell us how to live our lives? How should we understand the relationship between science and other systems of thought? This course will address these questions by examining texts from a number of 20th century philosophers. We begin with the earlier part of the century and the logical positivists. With this groundwork, we will then analyze the movement in philosophy of science towards an emphasis on history and on scientific practice, especially work by Kuhn, Feyerabend, and Toulmin. The final part of the course will discuss responses to these philosophers. By taking this course, students will become familiar with central issues in the philosophy of science, how to read dense texts, and how to develop a philosophical argument through writing.

Both the US and Italy claim pizza as a national dish, and this type of debate about where food comes from—and who it belongs to—is highly connected to our national and local identities. As humans continue to migrate across borders and blur the boundaries in digital spaces, our identities continue to develop as we interact with each other and different types of food. We will consider how this movement shapes our ideas of ‘foreign’ and ‘local’ and how one becomes the other, as well as the line between honoring a culture and appropriating it.

We will examine the intersections of the genre conventions, rhetorical situation, and the writers’ identities to understand how these elements work together when producing texts. We will learn key composition concepts (genre, rhetorical situation, and multimodality) and support the
development of your genre research skills. We will use these concepts and conduct genre research to examine various food writing genres, such as narratives, recipes, and social media posts to understand how writing is an activity that goes beyond putting words together on a piece
of paper. These activities will support your overall genre research skills and deepen your understanding of writing, which can be transferred to other writing activities beyond this course. Classes will be based on genre analysis activities and group discussions. We will read works that address food writing genres and identity, and we will watch documentaries that explore the intersections of food, identity, and migration.

WI-24,"Lakey, Heather",HS,1065,I,Philosophies of Good and Evil,HS,TRUE,0,1,"Good and evil are timeless topics and they have motivated centuries of philosophical thinking. Although the terms “good” and “evil” are commonly used across a range of discourses, they are ambiguous, equivocal, and contested concepts. In an effort to explore different ideas about good and evil, this course provides a broad overview of the issues, arguments, and debates that shape philosophical ethics. Guiding questions include the following: What are the origins of good and evil? What makes an action right or wrong? Why do we act morally? What should we do with someone who commits a horrific act? Who decides what counts as a horrific act? What kinds of ethical theories operate without the concepts of good and evil? Is evil an outdated or relevant concept? Do the concepts of good and evil help or hinder moral thinking?

To critically unpack these questions, we will read works by ethical thinkers including Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, Hannah Arendt, Zhuangzi, Simone de Beauvoir, Abû Nasr al-Fârâbî, Nell Noddings, Peter Singer, Kwame Gyekye, Mencius, Sherman Alexie, and others. Along the way, we will study deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, ethical relativism, feminist ethics, Taoism, and existential ethics. In addition, we will unpack the ethical arguments that orbit concrete topics such as execution, murder, moral character, racial injustice, and our ethical duties to one another.

This course will familiarize students with the influential frameworks of ethical philosophy, and it will encourage students to apply these frameworks to specific ethical problems. Course requirements include class participation, three short papers, a reflection essay, and a final paper or project.

How does the moral treatment of animals change across the contexts of food, research, captivity, and the home? Historically, western philosophers construct the animal in opposition to the human. Why? What is an “animal” and why is the “human” contrasted with it? How does language shape and produce our relationships with animals? How is the animal represented and characterized, and how does this representation impact our thinking about animal ethics?

This discussion-based course explores the relationships between humans and non-human animals. Drawing on fiction, philosophy, and ethology, we will examine our beliefs and assumptions regarding animals, human-animal relations, and the ethical implications of the human-animal binary. This course will focus on a wide range of theoretical approaches, including the traditions of animal liberation and animal rights as articulated by thinkers such as Tom Regan and Peter Singer, the growing field of animal studies as represented by thinkers like Jacques Derrida, and current debates in practical ethics, such as animal experimentation, hunting, and invasive species.

Upon completion of the course, students will have refined their understanding of the concept of the animal and they will be familiar with the key legal and ethical debates regarding human-animal relationships. Course requirements include class discussions, weekly writing exercises, a midterm exam, and a final paper or project.

Playwrights (and screenwriters), like cartwrights and shipwrights, are all skilled builders of vehicles meant to move people from one place to another. We will explore dramatic structure from the perspective of the audience. Whether writing linear narratives, collage or non-linear plays and films, there is a rhythm to dramatic writing that can be studied. We will make a conscious study of form to free us to write what we are driven to write. Through reading, analysis and writing, we will investigate the dramatic elements of character, conflict, language and theme. The course will include practical writing exercises to motivate and progress the writing from first draft through revision to rehearsal draft. Students will be encouraged to develop productive writer habits and self-discipline. Class time will be divided between hearing students’ work and discussing work we’ve read. We will develop our listening skills when hearing our own and colleagues’ work. We will explore the role of critique in new script development and refine a process that works for us. Students will be expected to bring new pages in to each class building to a complete first draft of a full-length play or screenplay (of any length) by the end of the course. Evaluation will be based on the student’s dedication to developing a writing practice as well as the submitted script.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions.  This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets.

This includes works by those individuals most often associated with the first wave of the movement including: Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Ernestine Rose, Anna Dickinson, Lucretia Mott,  Victoria Woodhull, as well as other activists who are generally less well known today. While this is a course rooted in the history of what we might consider early American feminism, it should come as no surprise that, along the way, we will confront issues that continue to have salience today.  Many of the topics surrounding gender, sex, identity, equality, empowerment, and political allyship that these activists wrestled with are still just as relevant for us to consider in our contemporary context.  This is especially true when it comes to the topic of race and the intersectional nature of the discourse around gender equality, both then and now. We will spend time examining how the idea of race was rhetorically constituted, in both exclusionary and inclusionary ways, within these texts.  We will also look specifically at the works of early Black feminists in the United States, and the myriad of ways they  navigated the challenges of the moment, especially as they confronted a deeply embedded legacy of white supremacy within the early woman suffrage movement.   Rather than rely primarily on secondary historical accounts, there will be a heavy emphasis on the close reading of primary source materials, mostly speeches, as we encounter these speakers “in their own words.” In addition, students will also take part in “hands on” recovery projects designed to locate, transcribe, document, and make broadly accessible works  from the period that have been previously undocumented or left unaccounted for. In doing so, students will learn basic techniques for exploring and making effective use of various types of digitized historical collections that have emerged in recent years.

Participants will investigate low cost, high impact approaches to water reuse for a neighborhood in medieval Islamic Cairo (Egypt) suffering from poverty, food insecurity, and increasingly severe climate change impacts. As with many other neighborhoods in Cairo and cities throughout Egypt, the residents of al-Khalifa confront the irony of abundance amidst scarcity: living in a hot, arid desert environment where rainfall is virtually nonexistent at the same time dealing with a failing water supply infrastructure (leaky pipes) raising the groundwater table, saturating and undermining building foundations, and exacerbating respiratory illnesses. This studio will investigate possibilities for intercepting and treating this water to help drive community-scale rooftop gardening (in a city where food prices have risen dramatically in recent years), introducing street level evaporative (passive) cooling features to improve comfort by ameliorating the urban heat island effect, and in other ways enlisting recycled water to beneficial ends and premised on the notion that “there is no such thing as waste.”

A “research” studio is a highly collaborative one. Studio participants will have opportunities throughout the term to interact with a Cairo-based team of urban designers, digital animators, storytellers, engineers, heritage conservationists, ethnographers, and others. Students with experience and/or interest in design, food systems, chemistry, the arts, environmental sciences, environmental economics, women’s and gender studies, heritage and cultural history, and anthropology are encouraged to enroll (previous coursework in these areas is not required but will be helpful). This research studio resists “solutionist,” “techno-optimist” approaches (“we have the solution to all your problems”), operating instead from the standpoint of humility in the search for path-of-least-resistance correspondences between available resources and culturally appropriate end uses. To that end, reflection on and articulation of one’s positionality in our global world provides a subtext for all that we do.

Evaluations will be based on participation and sustained engagement with the core studio themes, honing of collaborative capabilities, and commitment to an iterative process involving succinct compositions of written narratives and diagrams and other visual representations of the systems we will be examining. Above all, the studio requires initiative and engagement as we transition from a highly facilitated framework at the beginning of the term (topics, resources and methods that the instructor choreographs) to more independent and applied research given the “life” that project-based work acquires as the term progresses.

We will deconstruct and investigate building systems in the first half of the class: landscape and site systems; water; heating, cooling and ventilating (with a strong focus on passive or natural systems); and building materials, envelope, and construction. We will then discuss integrated building systems, that is to say, design strategies for achieving synergies between systems so the sum is greater than the parts (arguably the overarching goal of sustainable design). Exposure to and analysis of case study projects and guest talks by cutting edge contemporary practitioners will enrich our understanding of the current state of sustainable architecture and promising directions now under research and development.

WI-24,"Sebastian, Neeraj",AD,4046,MA,Drawing Intensive / Developing a Studio Practice,ADS,TRUE,80,1,"In the first part of this course, drawing will be used to experiment, interrogate and expand different aspects of one’s artistic practice. Using a broad range of materials, students are encouraged to work intuitively and take multiple approaches to presenting ideas–especially ideas that may not have been explored previously in their work–and develop them in different ways. Students will create large quantities of drawings based on prompts that will then be discussed with the class. What stands out? What makes a piece surprising or interesting? What revisions can be made to strengthen these moments or motifs? These are kinds of questions that will inform our discussions.

Taken together, these drawings will offer a broad range of possibilities that will then be explored for the rest of the term, during which students will develop a body of work. Students will meet weekly as a group to discuss work made or advanced in the previous week and meet individually with the instructor every other week to discuss materials and other aspects of their art practices. The work made over the course of the term should include material investigation (why are you using the materials you’re using and how does it support your thematic interests?) and embody a range of conceptual concerns. Throughout the term, students will be introduced to several artists’ working methods. Students are expected to work independently and have some degree of familiarity with the materials they choose to work with.

“Drawing” is used broadly here: students working in any medium are encouraged to take this course (for example, a student interested in three-dimensional work might respond to the prompts with forms made from cardboard or other found materials). This course is designed to kickstart a nascent practice or one that might have become dormant or plateaued as well as give students room to experiment and then build on these experiments. Students enrolling in this class should have some form of previous studio experience.   Evaluation will be based on students’ work, participation in class discussions, the ability to offer critical and constructive feedback to one’s peers, and the ability to push oneself beyond one’s comfort zone or perceived limitations—especially when it comes to allowing the work to evolve and change in response to feedback and critique.

The exercises in this class include “transcribing” other artists’ work to try to understand why certain images have an impact on us or function the way they do, and then use these insights in the creation of new work; making work iteratively (how does varying a single element change a piece?); and exploring different ways of translating abstract ideas into two-dimensional work. Students will be introduced to different theories of color and through exercises explore how an observed or mixed spot of color can be thought of as having hue (where it sits on the color wheel), value (how light or dark it is) and chroma (how saturated it is); how colors interact with each other; and consider the limitations of such systems. Students will be working with line, color and shape, from imagination as well as from observation–of still life setups (including assemblages that they make themselves) and models. Evaluation will be based on the completion of assignments and exercises in a way that demonstrates an understanding of the ideas introduced in the class, engagement with the course materials, the ability to provide feedback and the ability to respond to feedback in one’s work.

Methods of contemplation will come primarily from Zen and Creativity by John Daido Loori, The Illuminated Space: A Personal Theory & Contemplative Practice of Media Art by Marilyn Freeman, and The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. These and other readings will be supported by in-class exercises and examples of contemporary art engaging similar themes. Time will be spent each class in meditation to connect body and mind before engaging with artwork. Students working across various mediums are welcome, while the artists' work shown in class will focus on moving image and sound, with some work from installation, performance, and photography based on student interest.

His assertion came on the back of pivotal albums such as The Beatles’ “Revolver” and The Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966), which demonstrated the creative possibilities of composing in the studio. We might call this type of approach to music composition “playing the studio.” In this course, students learn how music production makes use of editing, mixing, and effect processing to maximize its impact. Through readings, film screenings, and audio listening sessions, students learn about past and present studio techniques and use these techniques during audio projects and exercises. Students learn to use virtual instruments, effect processors, microphones, and COA’s recording studio to strengthen their technical audio recording, editing, and mixing skills. Students will be evaluated based on their participation in class discussions, their fluency in the use of recording equipment and software, the process they use to approach each assignment, and the completion of assigned projects.

What is chamber music and how has it developed through the centuries? How is it relevant today? 
The bulk of this course is a lab/ensemble opportunity to perform in small chamber groups, based on experience and following a musical score. To deepen our understanding of the music we play, it's helpful to understand the political, social and cultural trends that influenced and shaped chamber music across the Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Modern eras. There will be mini lessons about the composers and their places in history, along with listening guides, but the majority of class time will be spent in rehearsals coached by the instructors. Music will be chosen by the instructors based on demonstrated abilities, with input from participating students.

The decline of the world’s ice sheets and mountain glaciers will impact sea level, infrastructure, and fresh-water resources for communities around the world. To put current changes into a long-term geologic context, students will learn the processes, landforms, and impact of glaciers on the Earth's surface as the planet has cycled through ice ages. This course is designed to provide students with a solid understanding of the dynamic interactions between ice, climate, landscapes, and humans over varying spatial and temporal scales. In addition, we will cover the basics of glaciology and the physics that influence the structure, size, and movement of ice. Through class discussions and assigned problem sets, students will reinforce the content covered in lectures. In addition, this course will give students hands-on experience with tools and methods commonly used to study glaciers and ice sheets (such as: ground-penetrating radar, LiDAR, rock sampling for cosmogenic analysis). This course will have various field trips during class time on Mount Desert Island to explore how an ice sheet shaped the region’s landscape during the Last Glacial Maximum. Students will be evaluated on weekly problem sets and readings and a final project and presentation related to this history of glaciation in Maine.

In all cultures, throughout time, artists have sought ways to tell stories about far ranging topics -- the unknown, the success of a hunt, gods and goddesses, historical events, wars, court tales, biblical themes, social instruction, morals, politics, product promotion, and personal imaginings.  Historically, artists have adapted visual story telling techniques to exploit evolving technology and changing social concerns, from ancient wall markings, tomb inscriptions, scrolls, illuminated manuscripts, pottery decoration, carved totems, pictorial painting, to sequential engraved prints, comic books, graphic novels, graffiti and the web. In this studio course, students will investigate ""visual language"", symbolism, and some of the pictorial devices, materials, and techniques employed by artists to tell stories visually -particularly through sequential composition in the graphic arts. 

Through focused assignments, discussion of artists' works (historic and across cultures), and guided demonstrations in a variety of materials and techniques, students will respond to select historic forms of visual narrative to create unique contemporary forms in which to tell their own relevant stories. ""Case Study"" studio projects will be selected to focus on key points in world history that mark technological transition in material, technique and pictorial devices employed by artists to render visual narratives.  Projects will range from the hands-on exploration of ancient wall painting and low relief carving technique, through non-press printing techniques such as linocut, image transfer, and potato prints, to collage of found images, xerography, Polaroid print manipulation, digital prints and ""synthetic"" imaging on the computer. Students will be encouraged to explore and invent new forms of sequential composition and utilize new or previously unexplored materials or techniques.  Concurrent investigations in visual studies will focus on the meaning created through the use of pictorial devices, signs and symbols, and the creation of narrative structure through repeated image/duplication, sequential composition, and visual allegory.

This course uses theories of social movements as a starting point to look at strategies for social change and criteria for evaluating them. The course assumes it is important to understand views and strategies we disagree with respectfully and with careful analysis. The class combines readings in history and theories of social change, and diverse case studies from both the left and the right. It looks both at classic cases (e. g. Gandhi, King) and a variety of efforts from recent years and the present (e.g. Indivisible, the Tea Party, #MeToo, Zapatistas, 350.org, Black Lives Matter, Cambridge Analytica, and alternative food system entrepreneurship). This is a course for students who want to develop skills for doing critical analysis of society, for developing effective plans to create social change, and for applying strategies to implement those plans.

Writing is both an art and a social action that can change us and our audiences. That is the province of this course.

We will read and analyze various forms of writing (genres) on a broad range of social and policy issues, such as the value of wonder, the importance of antiracist work, the need for accessibility policies on college campuses, and other issues. We will consider the craft, context, audience, purpose, and possibilities of these texts as guides for our own writing. We will focus on the possibilities of the written and spoken word; the power of our distinct and unique voices; the importance of taking risks in our thinking and writing; the messiness, urgency, and necessity of the writing process; and the value of intellectual inquiry and the seamless integration and documentation of researched material. 

Students will address current issues of pressing concern and personal relevance in their own writing in three different selected genres (e.g., reflective essay, commentary, letter to editor, Commencement speech, testimony, proposal, open letter, personal statement, etc.). Students will examine and develop strategies for writing with curiosity, clarity, complexity, creativity, courage, and compassion as they invite their audience to consider their ideas and invitations/calls to action. Students will write about issues that matter to them, ones of interest to a local (Mount Desert Island or home town), state (Maine or home state), and/or national audience.

How and why does relativity and quantum mechanics compel us to discard commonsense ideas about the nature of the physical world that are part of classical mechanics?  Why is there not agreement on how to interpret quantum mechanics, and why does quantum mechanics even need interpretation? This version of Physics II covers Einstein's theory of special relativity and selected topics in quantum mechanics, and is designed to introduce students to some of the formalism and central results of relativity and quantum mechanics, so that they can formulate scientifically grounded answers to the above questions. Throughout the course we will start with first principles and carefully build toward key results, allowing students to see how relativity and quantum mechanics—two of the pillars of modern physics—were constructed and how they cohere as mathematically consistent and experimentally verified theories. The first half of the course will cover relativity topics including the principle of relativity, spacetime intervals and proper time, coordinate transformations, time dilation and Lorentz contraction, and relativistic energy and momentum. The second half of the course will turn toward the foundations of quantum mechanics, including: spin-1/2 particles, wave-particle duality, and Bell's inequalities and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. If time permits, we may cover additional topics such as blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, and quantum cryptography.

After establishing a foundation in the key historical forces leading to the creation of the African diaspora, students will explore case studies related to the development of local and transnational musical styles from salsa to hip-hop, funk, reggae and more. We will explore the intersecting work of artists (such as Janelle Monae, Angélique Kidjo, Fela Kuti, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and Bob Marley) and scholars (such as Paul Gilroy, Angela Davis, Amiri Baraka, and Michael Veal). Equal weight in the course will be given to reading, listening, and writing as valuable modes of interacting with music. Throughout the course of the term, students will learn to listen more closely to sound and to develop a critical capacity for relating these sounds to the political and social worlds from which they emerge. Turning our attention back and forth between the local and the transnational, Black Atlantic Music is a window into how music takes shape in the context of culture, politics, geography and history.

Combining the traditional music of his Romani heritage with French bal-musettes and the Swing music storming Europe from the other side of the Atlantic, Reinhardt pioneered a sound that came to be known as “Gypsy Jazz,” “Jazz Manouche” or “Hot Club Jazz.” This class will focus on the rich musical repertoire flowing from this history as we work to practice, perform, and learn about its sounds and histories. A practice-based course organized around learning and performing the music, it will treat a series of compositions as entry points for lessons in jazz improvisation, understanding harmonic motion, chord voicing, and rhythmic awareness (swing, waltz, bossa, bolero, etc.). In addition to practice-based work, students will also learn about the histories of Romani (Sinti) migration across Europe and the genealogies of musicians as they relate to the development of Jazz Manouche. Students will read texts concerning Django Reinhardt and other key figures and will write a final paper that reflects research into the people, places, and sounds associated with this music. Assessment will be based on class participation, weekly practice logs, and the final paper/project. The course is designed for students with a working knowledge of an acoustic instrument (guitar, strings, bass, percussion, accordion, mandolin, woodwinds, brass, percussion, etc.).

Catalysts are everywhere around us. Enzymes in your body are catalysts that drive metabolic processes, the catalytic converter in your car or woodstove transforms harmful combustion side products into more benign products. Catalysts in industrial contexts enable the production of elaborate pharmaceuticals, drugs or materials. Minerals in hydrothermal vents can facilitate reactions useful for the emergence of life (CO2 can be transformed into larger carbon-containing biomolecules). In the classroom and the laboratory setting, students will explore how catalysts decrease the energy demand for various chemical transformations, and in some cases open up new pathways for otherwise inaccessible processes. This course is relevant for students interested in molecular biology, green/sustainable chemistry, and conversion of biomass to value-added chemicals. This course will be laboratory intensive, accessible for introductory students, yet still relevant for advanced students. Importantly this course can serve as an additional credit of organic chemistry for graduate or professional school for those who need it. In the lab, students will set up chemical reactions and analyze the products by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by UV/visible spectroscopy.

However, what is often overlooked is the role that writing and language play in maintaining—but also transforming—these structures. How do writing and language intersect with social (in)justice? And why does this matter to us as we try to solve social issues?

In this class, we will examine how social issues intersect with writing and you will develop an understanding of the role of language and discourse in social life. Topics include—but are not limited to— language and discrimination, language and gender, and diversity in language. To learn more about different social issues, we will conduct research, analyze discourse, and engage critically with information. While information is readily available, there has also been a significant growth in disinformation. How and where can we find trustworthy information about a social issue in an ocean of (dis)information? This course will help you refine your research practices and you will learn how to navigate and evaluate information.

For this course, a basic understanding of citation practices, how to navigate style guides, and an interest in analyzing discourse will be beneficial. Class activities are discussion-based and guided by readings on topics related to linguistics and discourse. You will participate in hands-on activities to sharpen your research skills and ability to locate and evaluate information. You will also be introduced to the basics of discourse analysis.

New techniques of genetic testing provide a method that can contribute to that understanding and in some cases fill in blanks left about ancestors and provide a new source of stories in addition to those passed along from generation to generation. Recreational DNA testing can also provoke discussion about how to make sense of the genetic stories revealed and how they mesh with or challenge people’s sense of themselves.

As researchers gather and publish more data, GIS becomes vital to graphically revealing the inter-relationships between human actions and environmental degradation. Much of what threatens the earth and its inhabitants is placed-based. Solutions require tools to help visualize these places and prescribe solutions.  This is what GIS is about. Built on digital mapping, geography, databases, spatial analysis, and cartography, GIS works as a system to enable people to better work together using the best information possible. For these reasons, some level of competency is often expected for entry into many graduate programs and jobs, particularly in natural resources, planning and policy, and human studies. The flow of this course has two tracts, technical and applied. The course begins with training in the basics of the technology. Then, skills are applied to projects that address real-world issues. Project work composes the majority of course work and each student has the opportunity to develop their own project. Because GIS provides tools to help address many kinds of issues, GIS lends itself well to the theory of thinking globally and acting locally. Projects often utilize the extensive data library for the Acadia region developed by students since the lab was founded in 1988. The GIS Lab acts as a service provider to outside organizations and students can tap into the resources of a broad network of groups and individuals working towards a more sustainable future. Course evaluations are partially based on the on-time completion of exercises and problem sets.

SP-24,"Rand, Kendra",HS,1094,I,Public Speaking Workshop,,TRUE,0,1,"Consider all the ways that public speaking could be a part of your academic and professional paths: presenting your research, sitting on a webinar panel, speaking up at ACM, advocating for an urgent cause or policy, preparing your senior project presentation, delivering a formal address at a special occasion, or even deciding to perform spoken word at an open-mic. This course will prepare you to thoughtfully analyze your audience, research and organize relevant information, and deliver the critically important, well-prepared presentation that you’re capable of.  Along the way we will be guided by, and critically analyze, three varied and sometimes contradictory premises: that it’s imperative to master the art of formal, standard presentation/speech delivery, that it’s equally important to respect and refine your own unique, authentic voice and speech communication style, and that important change happens when we both listen carefully and speak up loudly.  This class will be conducted as a workshop with an emphasis on students producing increasingly advanced speeches for public performance and/or consumption. Students will complete three graded, “formal” presentations  while also considering additional creative approaches and formats for  public communication.  Students will work with a variety of short texts and videos to generate new ideas and helpful public speaking habits.  The real benefits of this course come from the positive, supportive, environment in which students can practice new public speaking skills and learn from each other.  This class emphasizes a fun, dynamic, “hands-on” approach to constructing speeches.  Students who feel that they are less proficient in the area of public communication should not be worried that this would somehow disadvantage them in terms of their overall evaluation.  All students, regardless of their levels of comfort, experience, or and English-proficiency are encouraged to consider this course.  This workshop is designed to help you improve your public presentation skills regardless of whether you are a complete novice to public speaking, or already have many years of practice. Your final evaluation for the course will be based on your engagement with the process, not on some objective standard of who gave the best speeches.

Each class session will take the form of an ensemble rehearsal, beginning with a gentle warm-up that drops dancers into their sensory awareness. Once we are prepared to move safely, we will experiment with scores and prompts that generate movement and debrief our experiences through writing, drawing, and discussion. Opportunities will be provided to explore more specific microcosms of dance improvisation including musical collaborations, Contact Improvisation, and Emergent Improvisation. Short readings and video screenings will complement our embodied learning. We will develop an evening-length performance as our final project, to be performed on campus and at local schools. Students will be assessed based on attendance, participation in discussions, presence in rehearsals, and participation in our final performance.

Students will be introduced to the basics of color theory, mixing and matching colors, and also explore how color can change depending on context. Through the assignments we will investigate how form, volume, space and light can be captured in paint. Students will learn how to build their own frames and stretch and prepare canvases for painting and develop a studio practice, which includes cleaning and maintenance of brushes, the palette and other tools. A broad range of ideas and concerns in painting throughout history, from various parts of the world will be introduced in the class. In the last part of the term, different aspects of composition will be discussed: the way colors and shapes can work together to create an integrated image. Assignments will include quick paintings as well as paintings that are made over the course of multiple class sessions. The assignments over the course of the term will build students’ confidence in translating what’s in front of them, which makes the task of taking on the images in their heads, the images they are interested in, less daunting.
Students will learn how to look at and analyze their peers’ work and provide them with constructive feedback during critiques. Previous drawing experience at high school or college level is strongly recommended.

The assignments in the beginning of the term are designed to reiterate foundational drawing skills such as sighting and measuring and articulating a broad range of values in charcoal. Students will then work with ink and consider different ways of representing three-dimensional forms and spaces on paper and work at a large scale. The last part of the term will focus on color: students will work with pastels. We will work with a model and draw the figure in charcoal and in color. The translation of light and shadow and the integration of the figure into the environment will be emphasized.

Birds are particularly conspicuous elements of our world, and figure prominently in our art, religious symbolism, mythology, scientific endeavors and even sport.  Birds appear in European paleolithic cave paintings from 14,000 years ago, domesticated fowl are known from India circa 3000 BC, and ancient scholars such as Aristotle and Pliny the Elder devoted considerable time to ornithological observations.  In this century great strides have been made in the study of population biology and ecology, navigation and migration, and human induced ecological change (sometimes called human ecology), all through the study of birds. This class introduces the student to the ornithological world by using both scientific literature and direct field observation.  Systematics and physiology will be reviewed, but much of our effort will concentrate on reproductive ecology, behavior and the environment, and population dynamics.  There will be a strong emphasis on field observation - learning how to look at birds and their behavior in order to perhaps make larger observations about their environment.

This course pivots around the central questions: How do we know that a program is achieving its intended outcomes?  What processes facilitate or impede the program’s objectives? Students will learn the principles and practices of qualitative research methods to determine whether and how well an educational program accomplishes its mission through collaborating on the evaluation of a regional education project. The major objective of the course is to develop skills in document analysis, participant-observation, questionnaire design, interviewing, and qualitative data analysis. Students will work closely and extensively (over the course of two months) with an existing program and undertake all phases of a program evaluation: planning, data collection, data analysis, and reporting.  Evaluation will be based on class participation, four analytic memos, an oral presentation on a program evaluation design for an individual project, and a co-authored draft report of a program evaluation.

How can a teacher use this knowledge of students and subject matter to plan learning experiences that will engage diverse interests, adapt to a wide range of learning styles and preferences, accommodate exceptional needs, and meet state-mandated curriculum standards?  This course is a required course for prospective secondary school teachers that provides an introduction to the backward design process and diverse assessment strategies.  Students will engage in examining theory and practice designing and implementing curricula and assessments. A service-learning component will provide students with the opportunity to observe and participate in a variety of assessment methods in the subject they aim to teach.

-Michelle Mcnamara

Grew up reading Nancy Drew and Miss Marple? Can’t let a day go by without listening to a murder mystery podcast like Serial or My Favorite Murder? Love binge-watching shows like Killing Eve and Big Little Lies? Consider watching true crime documentaries your hobby? Then this is the class for you.

This college seminar will allow you to delve into the world of murder, mysteries, and the mayhem caused by these through a woman’s eyes. Be it a woman sleuth, a femme fatale, or a damsel in distress, women have been inextricably related to the world of crime. It is no wonder that they make up almost 75% of the listeners of true-crime podcasts and 80% of CrimeCon attendees (Times.com). We will study this phenomenon by paying close attention to not only literary genres like novels, short stories, and non-fiction writing but also non-literary (and multimodal) genres that include pop-culture favorites like TV shows, documentaries, and podcasts, some of which are mentioned above. Other works that we might consider are Sharp Objects (fiction), Dial A for Aunties (fiction), I’ll be Gone in the Dark (non-fiction), Mommy Dead and Dearest (documentary), and The Keepers (documentary).

Since this class also meets the writing requirement, part of your focus will be understanding writing as a dynamic literate activity by composing varied works. For example, you’ll write short reflection posts responding to questions like “Why women kill”?, opinion or review pieces that could appear in The New York Times, conduct interviews, and work on a term-long genre evolution project. All these are different genres and might target a specific audience: me, online readers, fans, or your peers. You will be evaluated on class participation, written work, and a final project.

Students will be evaluated on class participation, written work, and a final project. Lots of attention will be paid to peer review and revision as well.

Educators and theorists have championed hands-on experiences to better understand techniques, to improve adaptive/creative learning, and to foster passion and a deeper understanding of material. This course will focus on the built environment and learning through a hands-on practicum with three of the most fundamental building materials used in the world: wood, stone and steel.
Borrowing from the “farm-to-fork” concept familiar in food systems studies – this class will be based on a “field, fabrication, and function” format. Students will harvest, process, and build with locally sourced materials. This class is structured so teams of students design and fabricate outdoor benches made from live edge slabs placed on local granite or cedar legs. Along the way they will explore concepts of experiential learning, biophilia, eco/structural design, community engagement, collaborative learning, sustainable building practices, tool use, and safe building techniques.

Students will learn through readings, research, and, of course, hands-on work. Students will be assessed on a combination of short research projects, group discussions, class participation, reflective journaling, and final product assessment. The default grading for this course is pass/fail.

The remote Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador presents a stunning landscape, an astoundingly rich ecological setting, and a tragic history of poverty amidst an incredible natural resource, the northern cod fishery, that was ultimately destroyed. The province has been alternately invaded or occupied by different groups of Native Americans along with Norseman, Basques, French, British, and the U.S. military, because of its strategic location and rich fishing and hunting grounds. One of the first and one of the last British colonies, this richest of fisheries produced a very class based society, composed of a wealthy few urban merchants and an highly exploited population of fishing families often living on the edge of survival. But within the past 50 years, Newfoundland society has been forced to evolve. The provincial government looks towards oil and mineral exploitation to turn around the economy, while ex-fishermen consider eco- and cultural tourism with growing ambivalence. This then is our setting, and background, for an intense examination of the human ecology of this province; the relationship between humans and their environment, sometimes successful, sometimes otherwise, the struggle between the tenuous grasp of civilization and this marvelous, terrible place. To do this we will discuss various readings, examine case studies and review the natural and human history of this unique province.  Our learning will culminate with a two-week trip to Newfoundland to examine its issues firsthand.  Evaluation will be based on class and field trip participation, responses to reading questions, a field journal, and a final project.

How do these structures impact you? How are they made? Where do you locate yourself within the structures of which you are part? With whom are you in relation? How can we think about the idea of “agency” in conditions made by economic, political, material and social forces beyond our control? What is structural change? This course examines questions about change, resistance to change, choice, power, responsibility, politics and difference through an introduction to structural and post-structural thought. Structuralism and post-structuralism are modes of thinking that posit that the parts of a structure (e.g. of a society, of a text, of an institution) are made through their relations in that structure. This course will draw on structural and post-structural work in anthropology, literature, science and technology studies (STS), in postcolonial, gender and feminist studies, as well as in deconstruction and psychoanalysis, to investigate the significance of structures of kinship, economy, and language, as well as of institutions such as the school, the military, the state and the corporation. Students will be asked to consider the relation between individual and group, material, economic, racialized and gendered conditions of existence, and notions of agency, responsibility, the individual and the human. In addition to seminar discussions of texts and short writing assignments, students will select a structure within which they are located through which to investigate the central questions of the course. Authors we read will likely include Louis Althusser, Emily Apter, Tarek El-Ariss, Charisse Burden-Stelly, Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Emile Durkheim, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Donna Haraway, Ranjana Khanna, Claude Levi-Strauss, Karl Marx, Edward Said, Ferdinand de Saussure, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Anna Tsing.

We will address periods of feminist thought that have been significant in shaping the concerns of transnational feminisms, including 1970s U.S. feminism, French feminism, postcolonial theory, and Marxist thought.  Over the course of the term, we will consider how differences across national borders have informed discussions about transnational feminist solidarity. We will examine how feminist theory can help us think about the following: kinship; reproduction; the law and justice; human rights discourse, political economy, racialized and other forms of difference; existence and the subject; the relation between individual and group; the relation between terms such as ""gender"" and ""sex;"" and the varied currencies the terms ""queer"" and ""feminist"" have carried in different national and transnational contexts. 

The course will explicitly address debates in feminist theory about the following topics: the ""sex/gender distinction;"" histories and politics of the term ""rape;"" political representation, the juridical and the nation-state in the contexts of religious and cultural differences around practices such as veiling, circumcision/genital mutilation; and questions of labor, prostitution and sex work.

Students will be evaluated based on short written responses to readings, in class discussion, two papers and a final project. The final project will explore the topics in the course through fiction, poetry, art, film, advocacy, interviews or other forms of expression. The course readings will be a mix of scholarly writing about genocide, first person accounts and perhaps some fiction and poetry. We will also watch and discuss videos. Class sessions will involve discussions with all of us together and also in small group discussions between students.
