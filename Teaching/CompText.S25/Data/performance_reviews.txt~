  No more ‘abrasive,’ ‘opinionated,’ or ‘nice’: Why managers need to
  stop giving women and people of color feedback on their personality

personalities during a performance review.

We met in the fall of 2014 and instantly connected. We had both had long
careers in technology, one as an operator and the other as an investor.
One of us had a PhD in computational linguistics and the other an MBA;
one of us was starting a company and the other invested in startups. We
were both working mothers and had both often been the only woman in the
room at work. We had both experienced bias in the workplace and were
both starting to think about how to change the systems that perpetuated
such inequities. 

Those common experiences laid a foundation that’s helped us work
together as founder and investor/board member. They also taught us that
the words we choose—and the words chosen about us—are at the very core
of the bias we face.

When we met, few people were talking about bias in language, especially
in the workplace. Now, spurred on partially by the Black Lives Matter
and #MeToo movements, businesses are much more focused on prioritizing
diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). There is broad recognition that
diverse teams deliver better results and do better serving a diverse
market, and that equity is a critical goal unto itself. But is that
focus making its way into how people communicate at work? We decided it
was time to gather fresh data to help us answer that question, and
areunveiling the results <http://textio.com/feedback-bias> of that
undertaking today.

Our new Textio research report on language biases in the workplace—
released on June 15 <http://textio.com/feedback-bias>— shows that we
have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to making real
behavioral change, despite increasing public commitment to embrace DEI.   

The report summarizes findings from two data sets. First, a wide range
of people were surveyed this spring on the feedback they have
received at work, with the goal of determining whether different groups
of people are experiencing feedback differently. Second, the report
shares findings on the language patterns within people’s real
performance feedback documents—received by more than 25,000 people at
over 250 different organizations. In combination, the data sets explore
whether, and to what extent, different groups of people are getting
different kinds of job feedback.  

Looking at both survey data and at the documented written feedback, some
stark facts emerge: different groups of people /do/ get different kinds
of feedback at work—with women, Black people, Latinx people, and older
workers receiving the lowest-quality feedback. These findings cut across
organizations, meaning that the patterns are not specific to just one
entity or its feedback culture.   

Among the report’s noteworthy findings: Feedback to men tends to focus
on the substance of their work, whereas women are 22% more likely to
receive feedback on their personality. Women are also twice as likely to
report being described as /collaborative/ and /nice,/ seven times more
likely to report being described as /opinionated,/ and 11 times more
likely to report being labeled as /abrasive./ By contrast, men are three
times more likely to report being described as /confident,/ and almost
four times as likely to report being described as /ambitious./  

Race and ethnicity also play a significant role in the feedback that
people receive. Asian people are described as /brilliant /more than
twice as often as white people, and more than four times as often as
Black or Latinx people. The same is true for the term /genius/, which
Asian people hear 1.7 times more often than white people, and 4.5 times
more often than Black people. On the other hand, the term /overachiever/
—typically applied to strong performers transcending low expectations—is
used to describe Black women 4.5 times more often than it is used to
describe white men.  

In the eyes of the feedback provider, /brilliant geniuses/ are expected
to perform well; /overachievers/ perform well despite having inherent
limitations. The encoded message underneath these patterns is both
biased and clear: Some groups are credited with more baseline talent
than others. This plays out not just in written feedback, but in
opportunities for challenging stretch assignments and promotion rates
over time.  

Both personality descriptors like /nice /and so-called fixed mindset
traits like /genius/ and /overachiever /(which imply innate
characteristics) are unactionable feedback. In other words, they do not
communicate how an employee might improve and reach the next level.

Not surprisingly, the groups who receive the least actionable feedback
also tend to be least represented in business overall, and in leadership
in particular. For instance, for every piece of unactionable (or non-
constructive) feedback received by white men under 40, women over 40
receive 4.4; Black women (across age groups), in contrast, receive 8.8.  

Why does this matter? Specific and constructive feedback about someone’s
work performance offers them more opportunities to grow. When one group
of people systematically receives feedback that is vague and biased by
gender or ethnicity, we expect to see this manifest in disparate career
opportunities and outcomes.

In other words, the people that consistently receive the most problematic feedback at work also have the lowest pay. There may be no clearer indication of the impact of receiving low-quality feedback over a long period of time. In this context, it’s hardly surprising that the people receiving the least and lowest quality feedback are also consistently the least represented in corporate C-suites and boards.  

The pervasiveness of language bias illustrates how challenging it is to
get beyond good intentions and create lasting, systemic change in the
workplace. For DEI policies to have real impact, it’s not enough to just
state an intention; organizations need to build robust systems of
accountability that set employees up for equitable behavior. These
systems need to cut across the whole employee experience.  

On an individual manager level, there are some straightforward ways to
ensure you’re providing less biased, more useful feedback to all. Avoid
commenting on employees’ personality traits, and focus on behaviors.
Provide concrete examples. Recommend specific changes in employee
behavior that would bring about better outcomes, and suggest new ways to
approach challenging situations.

Everyone deserves to get constructive, unbiased professional feedback.
Not everyone receives it. If we address the differences in the kinds of
feedback that different people receive, we can begin to address even
more significant workplace inequities: access to career growth, earnings
power, advancement, and leadership.
