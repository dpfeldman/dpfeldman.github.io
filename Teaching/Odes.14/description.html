<h3>Informal Description</h3><br>
<ol>
<p class="no-box">

This is the seventh time I have taught this class. So I have a pretty
good idea of how this course will go. Here are some thoughts on the
class and how to do well and have fun. 
<ol>
   <li> Most students find the material in Calculus III to be less
   difficult and more interesting that that of Calculus I and
   II. Calculus III basically re-does all of calculus, except with
   functions of two or three variables instead of just one
   variable. This means that along the way we will review and
   re-affirm concepts and techniques from the first two terms of
   calculus. 

   <li> Students who take this class should have had roughly a full
   year (or two college terms) of calculus. It is important that
   you've seen both differential and integral calculus and felt like
   you understood these topics reasonably well at some point. If you
   feel like you've forgotten a lot of calculus, that's ok. 
   
   <li> This class is a lot of work and will move at a fairly brisk
   pace. However, the workload is steady; you'll be doing
   approximately the same amount of work each week.

   <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
   confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
   sooner rather than later.  <!--You need to take responsibility to seek
   help if you need it. -->

  <li>This class is large, and there are no TAs.  We will need to work
  together to make sure that people everyone can get sufficient help
  on the homework assignments. 
   
   <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
   don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
   first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest
   working with others, starting the assignments well before they are
   due, and seeking help if you need it.

   <li> In many more traditional math classes the textbook has a ton
   of examples in them. The book we'll be using doesn't. The result is
   that students sometimes find the homework to be challenging,
   frustrating, and occasionally even annoying. However, I'm convinced
   that this style of homework -- where there's not an example just
   like the problem you're trying to do -- is much better
   pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this way. 

   <li> Our textbook emphasizes graphical and verbal understanding in
   addition to being able to work with symbols and numbers. Much of
   mathematics -- both theory and application -- is graphical or
   geometrical in nature. The graphical problems are not "lite"
   problems but are an essential part of the course. The graphical
   problems are most definitely "real math." Some of you may find
   graphical work difficult, as it's likely different than some of
   what you've been asked to do in math classes before. 

   <li> You will actually need to read the textbook in order to do
   some of the homework. I won't be able to cover everything in class,
   and/or you'll just want to see a topic explained in a different
   way. 

   <li> I very strongly recommend getting your own copy of the
  textbook. I think you'll learn more if you have your own copy to
  take notes in and always have with you when you're doing
  problems. An important part of introductory science and math classes
  is forming a strong, long-term relationship with some textbooks. 
  
  <li> We will use computers to help us do math.
  We will mainly use the
  website <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>.  These
  days pretty much anyone who uses math in some meaningful way in
  research needs to be good both at "pencil-and-paper" math and
  overall mathematical thought, as well as using a variety of computer
  programs and applications.
