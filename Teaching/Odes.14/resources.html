<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
We will make extensive use of python in this course.  You will need to
have python installed on a computer you have regular access to.  In
addition to python, you will need three python extensions:  numpy,
scipy, and matplotlib.  Python along with these three extensions is an
incredibly powerful and flexible environment for doing science and
mathematics.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Downloading:</b>  I think the easiest way to get python and
extensions set up is download them all in one lump.  (This is usually
called a distribution rather than a lump.)  I am not yet sure which
distribution will be best, but I think we should try anaconda first.
Here's how to do it
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">anaconda download
  page</a>. 
  <li>Select your operating system: windows, mac OSX, or linux.
  <li>Choose <i>I Want Python 3.4</i>.  This option is in the upper
  right, to the left of the linux penguin.
  <li>Follow the downloading and installation instructions.  It is a
  large download:  around 300 MB.
</ol>
<p>If anaconda doesn't work, there are lots of other options to try.
</p> 

<p><b>Using Python:</b> Most of the time we will use python via IDLE,
  an integrated development environment (IDE) for python.  Look for
  IDLE in your list of applications or wherever programs reside on
  your computer and launch it.  A python shell will appear into which
  you can type commands.  Usually you'll open a python file and write
  a program, save it, and run it.
<p>If you want to do a quick test, try typing the following:</p>
<pre>
  from pylab import *
  x = randn(10000)
  hist(x,100)
  show()
</pre>
<p>This will generate a list of 10000 normally distributed variables
  and plot them in a histogram.</p>


<p><b>Getting Started:</b> There are a vast number of tutorials for
  getting started with python.  Here are some options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php">python-course.eu/python3_course.php</a>.  
  <li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3">Non-Programmer's
  Tutorial for Python 3</a> on wikibooks 
</ul>
<p>If you find other good references, please let me know and/or post
  them on the discussion forum.</p>

<p><b>Troubleshooting:</b> If you have trouble getting python
  installed and working on your computer, please post a query on the
  piazza discussion board.  I use linux, and so I might not be able to
  provide mac- or windows-specific help.  So mac and windows users
  will need to help each other out, and the discussion forum is
  probably the best way to faciliate this.  Once python is
  successfully installed we'll all be able to help each other; python
  is the same on all operating systems</p>
