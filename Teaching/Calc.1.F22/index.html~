<h3>Axioms</h3>

<p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
true. The
mathematician <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/">Federico
  Ardila-Mantilla</a> has written four axioms that guide the work he does
in education and outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with
me.  They are:
<ol>
  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different
  groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic
  boundaries. </li>

  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
  mathematical experiences.</li> 

  <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and
  used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li> 

  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
    respect. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Community Agreement</h3>
<p>
Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about what
type of community we want to create this term.  Here is a community
agreement based on one written by Federico Ardila-Mantilla.
<blockquote>
This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and empowering
experience to every participant; we will build that rich experience
together by devoting our strongest available effort to the class. You
will be challenged and supported. Please be prepared to take an
active, critical, patient, creative, and generous role in your own
learning and that of your classmates. 
</blockquote>

	  <p>The building in which we gather for this class, and all of College
  of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the Wabanaki
  people. The Native American tribes in Maine today include the
  Abenaki, Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
  collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. I believe it is important
  to acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the web
  of colonialism, past and present. <!--The future, however, is still
  unwritten.--> </p>
