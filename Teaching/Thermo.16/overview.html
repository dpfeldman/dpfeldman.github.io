<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<br>

<ol>
   <li>I want to learn the basic princples and techniques of
   thermodynamics, and be able to apply thermodynamics to problems
   across the sciences.  

   <li>I want you to gain an understanding and appreciation of the
   structure and style of physics as an intellectual approach and
   discpline.  

   <li> I want you to have fun while working hard and learning a lot. 
</ol>


<h3>Textbook</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
<a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/">Daniel V. Schroeder</a>,
<a href="http://physics.weber.edu/thermal/">An Introduction to Thermal
  Physics</a>, Addison Wesley, 2000.  ISBN: 0-201-38027-7.  This book
  is awesome.  I expect to cover most of chapters 1-5.

<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>
<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be based on weekly homework
  assignments.  There may also be a final synthetic problem set or
  in-class exercise.  We will discuss this after the course has been
  up and running for a few weeks  </p>

<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 


<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
   <li> Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day. More than
   one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning
   this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of
   your grade. 
   <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
   can also consult me, other faculty, friends, and
   family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
   understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
   problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
   photocopy their solution and turn it in. 
<!--   <li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a
   grade no higher than a C. -->
<!--   <li> Unless students prefer otherwise, I do not plan on giving any
     exams in this class. If there is time, however, I would like to
     give a final, synthetic problem set. -->
   <li> You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
     trigonometry, and logarithms. There's no need to buy an expensive
     graphing calculator. 
  <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
    important that you check your email. 

  <li> Academic misconduct&mdash;cheating, plagarizing, etc.&mdash;is
    bad.  Any cases of academic misconduct may result in a judicial
    hearing. Possible consequences range from failure of the
    assignment to expulsion. 
<!--  <li>Here is some additional information on what is expected for
  homework solutions. -->
  <li> A more informal description and some advice about the course
  can be found <a href="./description.html">here</a>.
