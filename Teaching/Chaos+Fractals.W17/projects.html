<h3>Final Projects</h3>

<p>The final project is a chance for you to dig
    deeper into some area of the course and/or to connect the themes
    and ideas of the class to other interests and passions.  The
    specific format is quite open.  Below are some guidelines.

<ul>
<li> As a default, you should plan on giving a presentation in class
  of ten minutes in length, and will write an annotated
  bibliography.
<li> However, many other formats are possible.  But if you wish to do
  another format, you'll need to let me know by week seven.
<li> Some of you may wish to build something or create some artwork.
  If you do this, I'll also want a short piece of writing discussing
  the work. 
<li> If you want you can collaborate with another student and do a joint
  project. 
<li> Your project should be the result of a moderately large amount of
  work.  This isn't a term-long project, but it shouldn't be something
  done in a few days.  Sustained effort and thought over a period of a
  few weeks will result in a much stronger project than something done
  hastily.  
</ul>
