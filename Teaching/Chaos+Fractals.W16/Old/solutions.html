<h2 align=center>Homework Write-Ups</h2><p>
<p>
<br>


Here are some guidelines and other thoughts on homework solutions.

<ol>

<li>Problem write-ups are your permanent record of your understanding
of the material covered.  This is especially true in a course such as
this where there are no exams.  <p>

<li>Solutions should be clearly and logically presented.  This means
that:

<ol>
<li>Your method should always be clear.  It should be easy to figure
out what you're doing and why.
<li>Use a lot of space.  I recommend using unlined paper; there's an
almost unlimited supply of this in the recycling bins, and not having
lines encourages you to write large and give yourself space.  If you
are unable to liberate yourself from lined paper, try skipping some
lines.   
<li>Equations should usually be accompanied by prose.  Before plunging
into algebra, state what it is you're solving for.  If there are any
non-obvious steps in a calculation, explain them.
<li>Write equations in a logical order. 
</ol><p>

<li>Solutions should stand on their own; they should be understandable
to someone who hasn't read the problem.  This means that you should
paraphrase the question before writing your response.<p>

<li>For some problems you will find yourself using a java applet, or 
perhaps some computer program.  If possible, you should include some
printouts from whatever program or applet you're using.  Also, be sure
to include the applet's URL in your write-up. <p> 

<li>I will not give numerical grades on HW assignments.  Instead, I
will give a letter grade and try to include as many comments as I
can.  I'm mainly interested in seeing that you thoughtfully attacked
the problem and wrote it up in a clear and coherent way.  <p>

<!--
<li>On many homework assignments, I'll ask you to address a question or
respond to a set of ideas.  Your response, probably between one and
two pages, need not be a polished essay, but it shouldn't be a haphazard
journal entry, either.  Unless you have truly excellent handwriting,
your response should be word processed.  <p>
-->

<!--
<li>For these mini-essay responses, I'm not looking for a "correct
answer."  Rather, I might ask you to think about the strengths and
weaknesses of a type of mathematical model, or a think up a system or
situation that a model might fruitfully be applied to.<p>
-->


<li> Finally, a few minor requests:
<ol>
<li>On the top of the homework, please write the assignment number.
<li>If you don't have a stapler, that's ok.  But please don't mangle
and fold over the corner in an attempt to get the pages to stick
together.  Just write your name or initials on all pages and I'll
gladly staple them together.
<li>Please don't hand in problems on paper that has been torn out of a
spiral notebook.
