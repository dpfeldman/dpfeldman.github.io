<blockquote>
    Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
    more fun to teach than the calculus. It is like being the
    ringmaster of a great three-ring circus. It has been said that one
    can recognize the students on a college campus who have studied
    the calculus -- they are the students with no eyebrows. In utter
    astonishment at the incredible applicability of the subject, the
    eyebrows of the calculus students have receded higher and higher
    and finally vanished over the backs of their heads.

<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your problem  
    solving skills and mathematical confidence.  More generally, I
    want you to leave this course with an increased ability to
    <i>do</i> mathematics.
    <li>I want you to gain a firm, enduring understanding of one of
    the big ideas of calculus: the integral.
    <li>I also want you to gain a good introduction to infinite sums
    and series.    
    <li>I want you to be able to correctly perform
    mechanical calculations using the course content, apply problem
    solving skills to new areas, and effectively communicate problem
    solving strategies in writing.  
    <li>I want you to experience using a computer to help you do
    mathematics.  
    <li>I want you to learn semi-independently about a topic of your
    choosing and gain experience orally presenting technical
    information.  
    <li>I want you to have fun while learning a lot.
</ol>


<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>
As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, fourth edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. Be sure you have the right edition of
the book.  <a href="./textbook.html">Here</a> is more information
about the text.  I would like to cover most, but certainly not all, of
chapters 5-9.   



<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 70 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.  But I also
understand that many students believe (perhaps correctly) that grades
will make it easier to get into graduate or professional school.
</p>


<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>There will be an in-class midterm exam on Monday, May 4.  This
  test will be open notes, open book.  And there will be ample time to
  do the work.  You may not, however, get any help from any humans
  during the exam, nor will you be able to use a computer.  Why this
  form for an exam?
<ul>
  <li>I want to make sure that you don't over-rely on wolfram alpha.  
  <li>Some of you may in your future lives need to take timed,
  in-class tests, so it might be good to not get completely out of
  practice.
  <li>A short in-class test should take less time than a
  take-home test.  
</ul>

<!--<li>This class meets three times a week, although we will not make use
  of all of these meeting times every week.  There is not a separate
  lab for the course, just the three meetings. -->

<li>We will spend some time in class using the website wolfram alpha. 
    There won't be a separate lab session for this.  It will be
    incorporated into classes.   

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator or
  phone/tablet app that has trig functions, logs, and scientific
  notation.  You do not need a graphing calculator for this course. 

<li>Toward the end of the term you will do a
  small <a href="./projects.html">project</a>.  (However, I am open to
  considering other options.  Let's discuss this in a week or two.)

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li> The tutors will have some regular hours, and you should also feel
  free to contact them to find a time to meet.  

<li>Academic misconduct---cheating, plagiarizing, etc.---is bad. Any cases of 
academic misconduct may result in a judicial hearing. Here is the 
faculty-approved statement about plagiarism: <emph>By enrolling in an academic 
institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of academic honesty. 
Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a breach of 
such standards. A student must make it his or her responsibility to not 
use words or works of others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism 
is unacceptable and evidence of such activity is reported to the academic 
dean or his/her designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds 
for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class discussions 
of such questions when complex issues of ethical scholarship arise.  </emph>


<li>A more informal description of the course can be found
<a href="expect.html">here</a>.

<h3>Hours of Academic Engagement</h3>
<p class="no-box">
You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically engaged hours
associated with this one-credit course. These 150 hours will be spent
roughly as follows: 4.5 hr/wk in class,
0.5 hr/wk reading and preparing for class, 9 hr/wk on
homework, and 1 hr/wk on your final project.
