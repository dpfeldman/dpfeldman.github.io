<br>

<b>Homework 4:  Due Friday 6 October </b><p> For many of the
problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it still
might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning.<p> 
<br>


<b>Section 2.1:</b>
<ol>
<li>2, 4, 6, 8.  (20 points.)  No detailed explanations necessary.
You should, however, sketch a clear, large copy of the graph for your
own reference.  
<li> 10. (10 points)
<li> 12. (10 points)
<li> 14. (10 points)
<li> 18. (10 points)
</ol><p>
Although you don't have to, it might be faster to use Maple for
problems 14 and 18.  <a href="Example1/example1.html">Here is a short
Maple example working through a similar problem.</a><p>


<b>Section 2.2:</b>
<ol>
<li>  2. (5 points)
<li>  4. (5 points)
<li>  6. (10 points)  I advise making a very big graph.  It'll be
easier to see stuff this way.
<li>  8.  (10 points total).  
<li>  14, 16, 20.  (20 points total).  Do <b>not</b> use any
"shortcuts" or "rules" you may have learned in previous calc or
pre-calc classes. 
<li>  32.  (10 points).
</ol><p>


<b>Chapter 1 Review Problems, pp. 70-75:</b>
<ol>
<li> What topics from Chapter 1 were the most difficult for you?  What
do you feel you need more practice on?  Look over the review problems
and do some of them.  Do around "20 to 30 points worth" of work.  This
probably corresponds to 2 - 8 problems.
<li> Hand the review problems in separately; don't attach them to the
other homework.
<li> You will correct the review problems next week.  So give yourself
lots of room in which to write additional comments. 
<li>  This portion of this assignment is worth 20 points.  You will be
graded exclusively on effort.    
</ol><p>



<!--<b>Computer Problems:</b>
<ol>
<li>
</ol><p>
-->

<b>Bonus.</b>
<ol>
<li>2.2, 25.
<li>2.2, 28.
<li>Any of the stuff from the Focus on Theory section between chapters
1 and 2 would be good to look at.  
</ol>
