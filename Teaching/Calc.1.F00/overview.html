<blockquote>

Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
more fun to teach than the calculus.  It is like being the ringmaster
of a great three-ring circus.  It has been said that one can recognize
the students on a college campus who have studied the calculus -- they
are the students with no eyebrows.  In utter astonishment at the
incredible applicability of the subject, the eyebrows of the calculus
students have receded higher and higher and finally vanished over the
backs of their heads.

<h3>Course Overview
</h3>



I have three main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
    solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
    <li>I want you to gain a firm understanding of three big calculus
    ideas: the limit, the derivative, and the the integral.  
    <li>I want to have fun.
</ol>
<p>

As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, second edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. I would like to cover all of chapters
1, 2, and 3, parts of chapter 4, and some of chapter 5.  <i>Calculus
made Easy</i>, by Thompson and Gardner will be on reserve in the
library.  This is a fun, informal, entertaining introduction to
Calculus.  I won't assign any reading from it, however.<p>
<br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 60 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.<p><br> 

<h3>Tutors</h3>
<ul>
<li> The following students are available for calculus help:  Rita
Turner, Kathryn Hunninen, Katrina Zarrella, and Jen Dupras.
<li> Shiva Polefka is available for help with Maple.
<li> The tutors will have some regular hours, and you should also feel
free to contact them to find a time to meet. 
</ul>
<p><br>

<h3>Micro-Projects</h3>
In addition to the homework, occasionally I will assign
micro-projects.  These are small, hopefully fun projects which you
will work on collaboratively in groups of threes.<p><br>

<h3>Comments and Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>This class is big.  You and I will need to work together
creatively to make sure that this classtime is comfortable and
effective, and that outside of class people are able to get all the
help they need.  
<li>Start the homework early -- you won't enjoy doing it all in one 
day.  Don't fall behind; it's tough to get caught up.
<li>  Many of the homework problems are hard.  I don't expect you to
be able to sit down and do them right away.  If you're stuck on a
problem, don't despair.  Find some classmates to work with, and/or
find a tutor or find me.
</ul>
<p><br>

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.
<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
  You may not, however, get any help from any humans during the exam.
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading before class. 
<li>Instead of me presenting examples, I will often assign a few short
    problem that a pair of students will present in class.  This
    presentation is highly informal.
<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  
<li>I expect you to attend class.  Missing a few classes isn't a big
deal.  Please let me know beforehand if possible.  
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty two winters ago.
