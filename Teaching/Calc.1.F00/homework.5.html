<li> 17. (5 points)
<li> 26. (5 points)
</ol><p>

<b>Section 2.4:</b>  For these two problems, strive to write as clear
an explanation as possible.  
<ol>
<li>2. (10 points)
<li>10. (15 points)  Possibly confusing.
</ol><p>


<b>Section 2.5  :</b><ol>
<li> 2,4,6.  (5 points total)  No explanations necessary.

<li> 14.  (10 points)
<li> 15.  (5 points)
<li> 16.  (10 points)  Note that the graph is of the derivative, not
the function.  
</ol><p>

<b>Chapter 1 Review Problems, pp. 70-75:</b>
<ol>
<li> Solutions for Chapter 1 Review Problems are on reserve at the
library.  Correct the review problems that you handed in last week.
Make comments on your paper in another color pen or pencil, or on a
separate sheet.  Make some notes to yourself on these problems that
you'll find helpful if you ever need to do these sorts of problems
again (perhaps on an exam.)  (20 points).
</ol><p>



<b>Computer Problems:</b>
<ol>
<li>Do problem 7 from chapter using the "solve" command on Maple.
Print out your work.  (10 points)  <a
href="Example2/example21.html">Here is a short introduction to Maple's
solve command</a>.
</ol><p>


<b>Bonus.</b>
<ol>
<li>2.3. 32, 33
<li>The focus on theory chapter on differentiability and linear
approximation looks quite good. Local linearization is a very 
handy thing to have a feel for; we used it a bunch in Physics II last
year.  Problems 11-13 on page 143 look especially good. 
</ol>
