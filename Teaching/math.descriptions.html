<h2>College Algebra </h2>  
<b>Offered Fall Term</b>
<i>Instructor:  Bo Greene</i>. <p>


College Algebra is an introductory course designed to help students
see how quantitative reasoning can be used in various areas of study.
The focus will be on applications of math in real life situations and
algebra will be used as a tool to answer questions to practical
problems rather than as a set of mechanical rules to be practiced.
There will be a review of basic algebraic skills such as exponents,
radicals, and solving equations, but the emphasis will be on using
math in interpretive ways.  This course may be used for preparations
for other math classes such as Understanding Functions, but is not a
prerequesite.  Evaluation will be based on weekly homework sets,
exams, and group work.  Introductory.  QR.  

This class is for students who have had algebra and probably algebra two
in high school.  It is not a remedial math course, but is intended to
bring students to a reasonable level of comfort and competency in
concepts of algebra, either for use in other classes or for its own
sake.  This class may serve as a refresher for a subsequent
precalculus course, but will not, on its own, prepare students for
calculus.<p>  

It is assumed that you have taken high school math, but many of you
may not be satisfied with your level of mastery.  It has also probably
been a long time since you took (or used) math and you may suffer from
the "use it or lose it" phenomenon.<p>

This will most certainly not be a typical algebra course the likes of
which you probably encountered in high school.  There will be a strong
emphasis on interpreting tables of data and presenting data in various
graphical formats.  The material covered with be quite applied, not
abstract and seemingly useless.   This class is especially recommended
for students with a shaky math background who are interested in taking
science or economics courses, and/or who are in the educational
studies program.

<h2>Chaotic Dynamical Systems</h2>
<b>Offered Fall Term.</b>
<i>Instructor: Dave Feldman</i><p>

This course is a survey of a variety of modern topics in nonlinear
dynamics:  chaotic finite difference equations, fractals,
multifractals, differential equations, boolean networks, and cellular
automata.  The survey will be conducted at a fairly advanced
mathematical level, but the material will be covered with an applied
emphasis.  Numerical results and applications will be stressed rather
than proofs.  The text for this course will be <i>Understanding
Nonlinear Dynamics</i>, by Daniel Kaplan and Leon Glass.  I will
likely supplement the text with readings from journal articles and
other books.  <p> 

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly problem
sets and a final project.   Some computer
work will be required, but no computer experience is necessary. The
final project will provide students an opportunity to examine a
particular topic or application in considerable depth.  Projects can
consist of, but are not limited to:  a more rigorous investigation of
topics covered in class (i.e., a series of formal proofs); a case
study of a particular application; extensive numerical investigation
of a model system; a critical investigation of ``chaos theory's''
impact on literature, art, philosophy, or the social sciences; the
development of lesson plans or a curricular material for either a high
school math course or the introductory course on chaos and fractal
taught at COA. <p>

Prerequisites:  Calculus II (or the equivalent).  Advanced.  QR.
<p><br> 

<h2>Introduction to Statistics I</h2>
<b>Offered Fall Term.</b>
<i>Instructor: Sean Todd</i><p>

This course introduces the basics of statistical analysis that can be
used in either a scientific or a social science frame or reference.
While this course teaches you to perform both nonparametric and simple
parametric analysis both by hand and computer, an emphasis will be
placed on understanding the principles and assumptions of each test,
rather than mathematical ability per se.  We will also learn how to
report statistical results in journal format, and there will be plenty
of lab time to sharpen skills.  Evaluation is based on lab
participation, three quizzes, and a team project.
Introductory/Intermediate.  Prerequisite:  A college mathematics
course, or permission of the instructor.  QR.


<p><br>

<h2>Introduction to Physics I</h2>
<b>Offered Fall Term.</b>
<i>Instructor: Dave Feldman</i><p>

This course is the first of a two course sequence covering a range of
standard introductory physics topics. The goals of the course are: to
introduce students to important physical ideas both conceptually and
mathematically; and to help students improve their quantitative
skills.  <p>

The first part of the course consists of a broad look at the three
conservation laws: the conservation of momentum, energy, and angular 
momentum.  Along the way, we'll learn about vectors, work, potential
energy, thermal energy, and the energy stored in chemical bonds.
We'll conclude with a treatment of Newton's laws of motion.  If time
permits, we may briefly cover some topics from chaotic dynamics.
The text for the course will be Six Ideas that Shaped Physics, by Tom
Moore.  We will cover all of unit C and about a third of unit N. <p>
  
Evaluations will be based on participation in class and lab, weekly
homework, and two untimed, open-notes exams. This course makes
extensive use of algebra and trigonometry. Potentially difficult math
topics will be reviewed as necessary. Prerequisites: Understanding
Functions, or a strong high school algebra background, or consent of
the instructor. Introductory. *QR* *ES* Lab Fee:  $15.  Class size
limited to 20. <p><br> 

<h2>Introduction to Physics II</h2>
<b>Offered Winter Term.</b>
<i>Instructor: Dave Feldman</i><p>

This course is the second of a two course sequence covering a range of 
standard introductory physics topics.  We will cover electricity 
and magnetism, simple circuits, and Einstein's special theory of
relativity.  As our text we will use units E and R of Six Ideas that
Shaped Physics, by Tom Moore. <p>

Evaluations will be based on class participation, weekly homework, an
untimed, open-notes midterm, and a final project. This course makes
extensive use of algebra, vectors, and trigonometry. Potentially
difficult math topics will be reviewed as necessary, but the math in
this course may be difficult for those who haven't seen vectors
before. Prerequisites: Physics I, or the equivalent, or consent of the
instructor.  Intermediate. *QR* *ES*  Class size limited to 20.  
<p><br>

<h2>Introduction to Chaos and Fractals</h2>
<b>Offered Winter Term.</b>
<i>Instructor: Dave Feldman</i><p>

This course presents an elementary introduction to chaos and fractals. 
Through the study of discrete dynamical systems, students will
encounter examples of deterministic chaos and fractals---specifically
the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets.  You've probably seen the
Mandelbrot set and various Julia sets before; they're the pretty,
multicolored fractals that are on many book covers and posters and
calendars.<p> 

This class is for students who have had algebra and probably algebra II
in high school. It is not a remedial math course, but is intended to
give students significant practice in high school algebra while
providing an exposure to some recent advances in dynamical systems and
fractals.  Along the way, we will likely encounter complex
("imaginary") numbers and some ideas from
elementary probability and statistics.  This course is not a
systematic review of algebra.  Students needing such a review are
strongly encouraged to take College Algebra or Understanding
Functions.  <p> 

The text for this course will probably be <i>Chaos,
Fractals and Dynamics: Computer Experiments in Mathematics</i>, by Bob
Devaney.  We may also use portions of <i> Fractals and Chaos
Simplified for the Life Sciences</i>, by Larry Lebovitch, and <i>
Chaos</i>, by James Gleick. <p>

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly problem
sets and possibly one or more take home exams.   Some computer
work will be required, but no computer experience is necessary. <p>

Prerequisites:  High school algebra.  Introductory.  QR.  <p><br>


<h2>Introduction to Chemistry II</h2>
<b>Offered Winter Term.</b>
<i>Instructor: Don Cass</i><p><br>

This course is the continuation of Chemistry I.  It moves from using
atomic structure to explain chemical reactivity to using thermodynamic
concepts to understand the extent of different reactions.  This course
uses extensive algebra.  Intermediate.  Prerequisite:  Chemistry I or
the equivalent.  <p><br>


<!--<h2>Understanding Functions (Formerly Algebra II) </h2>  
<b>Offered Spring Term</b> (pending approval by the academic affairs
committee.)  <i>Instructor:  Bo Greene</i>. <p>

This course covers a variety of math topics at a pre-calculus level.
It is designed for students who have a working knowledge of basic
algebra skills (exponents, radicals, solving equations, simple
functions) and wish to broaden their math background and focus on
application.  A significant part of the course will focus on various
aspects of using functions.  Students will learn to work with and
apply linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential and
logarithmic functions.  Understanding and interpretation will be
emphasized rather than mathematical manipulation.  Graphing
calculators will be especially helpful.  Other topics will include
trigonometry in solving triangles, counting and probability, and basic
statistics.  Again, the emphasis will be on problem solving and
application.  Students will be evaluated mainly on weekly homework
assignments, two take-home exams, and a class presentation.  Group
work and participation will be an important aspect of the course.
Although Functions is logical follow-up to College Algebra, it is not
necessary to have completed the algebra course first.  QR.  Introductory.
