<h1 align=center>Final Paper Guidelines</h1><p>
<p>
<br>


Here are some guidelines for your final paper.

<ul>
<li>Your paper should <b>not</b> be a research paper.  You should draw
heavily on the readings we've done, but there's no need to do
additional research.   
<li>Your final paper should be synthetic and analytic: make
connections, analyze, draw conclusions, take a position, stake out
some territory. 

<li>Your paper should be around five to eight pages in length.

<li>Before writing, have a clear idea of who your intended audience
is. 

<li>I recommend writing in the first person.

<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed, and you should fully
cite all sources.  I don't care what format you use, but you should be
consistent.  

<li>Feel free to use a format other than a standard essay.
Possibilities include:
<ul>
<li>An open letter.  The letter could be backward in time (e.g. to
Oppenheimer in 1950), or current, or to someone in the future (perhaps
to a scientist in 2050).   
<li>An op-ed piece or an opinion piece for a magazine or newspaper.
<li>A work of fiction.
</ul>
If you plan on trying out any of these "non-standard" formats, please
let me know beforehand.

</ul>
