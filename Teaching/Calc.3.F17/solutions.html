<h3>Guidelines for Homework Solutions</h3><br>
<ol>



   <li> Problem write-ups are your permanent record of your
   understanding of the material covered. This is especially true in a
   course such as this that has no exams. Thus, you'll want to make
   your solutions complete enough so that you can understand them a
   month or a few years after you wrote them. 

   <li> Solutions should be clearly and logically presented. This
         means that: 
<ol>
     <li> Your method should always be clear. It should be easy to
          figure out what you're doing and why. 
     <li> Use a lot of space. I recommend skipping some lines if you
          use lined paper. 
     <li> Equations should usually be accompanied by prose. Before
          plunging into algebra, state what it is you're solving
          for. If there are any non-obvious steps in a calculation,
          explain them. 
     <li> Write equations in a logical order. 
</ol>
   <li> You should aim to develop some sort of semi-structured style
   for solving problems. Different people have different styles. But
   good, experienced problem-solvers all have some sort of system that
   they use. 

   <li> Solutions should stand on their own; they should be
   understandable to someone who hasn't read the problem. This means
   that you should paraphrase the question before writing your
   response. 

   <li> I will not give numerical grades on HW assignments. Instead, I
   will give a letter grade and try to include as many comments as I
   can. (If you don't want a letter grade on your homework, that's
   fine. Please make a note to this effect on the top of your
   assignment.) I'm mainly interested in seeing that you thoughtfully
   attacked the problem and wrote it up in a clear and coherent way. 

   <li> Finally, a few minor requests:
<ol>
     <li> On the top of the homework, please write the assignment
          number. 
     <li> If you don't have a stapler, that's ok. But please don't
          mangle and fold over the corner in an attempt to get the
          pages to stick together. Just write your name or initials on
          all pages and I'll gladly staple them together. 
     <li> Please don't hand in the assignment in installments; hand in
         the problem set all at once.. 
     <li> As much as possible, please put the problems in order.
     <li> Please don't hand in problems on paper that has been torn
     out of a spiral notebook.  
</ol>
</ol>
<br><br>

<h3>Thoughts on Learning Math and Doing Problems</h3><br>
<ol>
  <li> It is important that you develop a style or system for solving
  problems and doing math.  Individual styles will vary, though.
  <li> You want to hone your style and techniques on moderately
  difficult not-quite-easy problems.  This way when you encounter
  fiercely difficult problems, you'll have a solid technique to help
  you.
  <li> For difficult or multi-step problems, as opposed to the short
  practice/calisthenics sorts of problems, you should usually think
  about two phases to problem solving.
  <ol>
    <li>Figuring it out.  This is where you follow dead ends, make
    mistakes, do calculations, and struggle until you get it.
    <li> Writing it up.  In this phase you consolidate your work,
    write it up clearly and explain your methods.  You might mention
    some dead ends or a mistake you made while doing the problem, but
    usually you want to present an orderly path to the solution.
  </ol>
  <li> The writing-it-up phase does add a bit of time to the
  assignment, but I am convinced it is worth it.  It is often the
  difference between doing doing well and doing great&mdash;not
  necessarily in terms of your grade, but definitely in terms of the
  lasting value of the assignment.
  <li> When collaborating with others, I strongly recommend doing the
  writing-it-up phase on your own.  This is a way to make sure that
  you really understand what you and your colleagues have just figured
  out.
