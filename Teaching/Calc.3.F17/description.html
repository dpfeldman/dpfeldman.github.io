<h3>Informal Description</h3><br>
<p>
This is the ninth time I have taught this class. So I have a pretty
good idea of how this course will go. Here are some thoughts on the
class and how to do well and learn a lot. 
<ol>
   <li> Most students find the material in Calculus III to be less
   difficult and more interesting that that of Calculus I and
   II. Calculus III basically re-does all of calculus, except with
   functions of two or three variables instead of just one
   variable. In the last third of the class we re-re-do calculus for
   vector fields.  This means that along the way we will review and
   re-affirm concepts and techniques from the first two terms of
   calculus.  

   <li> Students who take this class should have had roughly a full
   year (or two college terms) of calculus. It is important that
   you've seen both differential and integral calculus and felt like
   you understood these topics reasonably well at some point. If you
   feel like you've forgotten a lot of calculus, that's ok. 
   
   <li> This class is a lot of work and will move at a fairly brisk
   pace. However, the workload is steady; you'll be doing
   approximately the same amount of work each week. We'll hit the
   ground running and try to get lots of stuff done the next few
   weeks. The workload may taper off some toward the end of the
   term, although the material at the end might be a bit more
   difficult.  

   <li> This class meets three times a week instead of the usual two.
   The Wednesday meeting is a normal class session, not a lab.  This
   extra time will let us cover more material and have classtime be a
   bit more relaxed.  
   <!--It also gives us a buffer in case we miss a day or two due to
   snow or other winter nastiness. -->

   <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
   confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
   sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can
   offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know who
   needs it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if you
   need it. 
   
   <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
   don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
   first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest
   working with others and seeking help if you need it. I also
   strongly suggest that you start the homework well before it's due. 

  <li>A portion of most assignments will involve WeBWorK, a system
  developed by the Mathematical Association of America.  It has been
  in use for quite a few years and is used at many colleges and
  universities.  There are several advantages to an online system:
<ol>
    <li> You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
    learn right away from your mistakes.  And on most problems you
    can submit solutions many times until you get everything correct.
    <li> Since the problems are automatically marked, the TAs and I
    can spend more time helping you and won't have to spend as much
    time grading.
    <li> Some problems are randomized so that you will all get slightly
    different versions of the questions.  This means that collaborating
    with other students will be maximally effective, since you'll have
    to share solution methods and not just the final answer.
</ol>
   WeBWorK has worked well in other classes, but it does take a bit of
  getting used to.  If you find yourself getting frustrated, be sure
  to ask for help.

   <li> In many more traditional math classes the textbook has a ton
   of examples in them. The book we'll be using doesn't. The result is
   that students sometimes find the homework to be challenging,
   frustrating, and occasionally even annoying. However, I'm convinced
   that this style of homework -- where there's not an example just
   like the problem you're trying to do -- is much better
   pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this way. 

   <li> Our textbook emphasizes graphical and verbal understanding in
   addition to being able to work with symbols and numbers. Much of
   mathematics -- both theory and application -- is graphical or
   geometrical in nature. The graphical problems are not "lite"
   problems but are an essential part of the course. The graphical
   problems are most definitely "real math." Some of you may find
   graphical work difficult, as it's likely different than some of
   what you've been asked to do in math classes before. 

   <li> You may actually need to read the textbook in order to do
   some of the homework. I won't be able to cover everything in class,
   and/or you'll just want to see a topic explained in a different
   way. 

   <li> I very strongly recommend getting your own copy of the
  textbook. I think you'll learn more if you have your own copy to
  take notes in and always have with you when you're doing
  problems. An important part of introductory science and math classes
  is forming a strong, long-term relationship with some textbooks. 
  
  <li> We will make use of computers to help us do math.
  We will use the
  website <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>. 
  I think you'll like it.  These days pretty much anyone who uses math
  in some meaningful way in research needs to be good at
  "pencil-and-paper" math and overall mathematical thought, and facile
  with a variety of computer programs and applications.
