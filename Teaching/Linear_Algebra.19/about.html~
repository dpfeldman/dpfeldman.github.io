<ol> 
<li>I want you to learn what differential equations are and how to
  think about them: how they are used to model a range of phenomena
  and how to interpret their solutions.

  <p>so, umm, what is linear algebra, anyway?</b>
  <h2>What is Linear Algebra?</h2>
</header>

<p>Wikipedia's entry
  on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear
  algebra</a> has a pretty good summary:
<blockquote>
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of
vectors, with families of vectors called vector spaces or linear
spaces, and with functions that input one vector and output another,
according to certain rules. These functions are called linear maps (or
linear transformations or linear operators) and are often represented
by matrices. Linear algebra is central to modern mathematics and its
applications. An elementary application of linear algebra is to the
solution of a system of linear equations in several unknowns. More
advanced applications are ubiquitous... . It has extensive
applications in engineering, physics, natural sciences and the social
sciences. [Linear algebra is also important to study because]
nonlinear mathematical models can often be approximated by linear
ones.  
</blockquote>

<p> Linear algebra is a very standard topic in the college mathematics
  curriculum.  It is usually taken by students in their sophomore
  year.  Linear algebra is generally required for math, physics,
  engineering, statistics, and economics majors.  While linear algebra
  is a standard subject, there are considerable differences among
  linear algebra courses and textbooks. Roughly speaking, there are
  three somewhat overlapping roles that linear algebra plays in the
  math curriculum:  
<ol>
<li>Linear algebra teaches a set of techniques for solving
    problems. These classes often emphasize applications. 
<li>Linear algebra serves as a bridge toward more formal or abstract
    mathematics. 
<li>Linear algebra can be an entry point for numerical
    mathematics. This includes:  Using a computer to do mathematics
    and solve problems and analyzing the run-time and convergence
    properties of algorithms, writing original code.  
</ol>
<p>This course is mostly of type 1 but will contain elements of 2.  We
will do only a little bit with computation in this class.  

<p>This course is a combined linear algebra and differential
  equations course.  While most math programs have separate linear
  algebra and differential equations courses, combined courses such
  as this one are not uncommon.  Such combined courses are often part
  of engineering math sequences.  (Sometimes such courses are called
  linear systems.)

<p>Linear algebra and differential equations are pillars of modern
  applied mathematics.  I think it makes sense to do an introduction
  to them at the same time.  This course emphasizes conceptual and
  analytic (pencil-and-paper) understanding of linear algebra and
  differential equations.  My differential equations course focuses on
  computational methods and mathematical modeling.  The two courses
  are designed to complement each other.  Please note that a course in
  python (or the equivalent) is a pre-req for differential equations
  at COA. 




<header class="align-center">
  <p>these are cautionary notes for me as well as you</b>
  <h2>Some Warnings</h2>
</header>

<ul>
  <li>I have taught linear algebra and differential equations many
  different time, but only once before as a combined class.  In order
  to make this class work---really see the connections between linear
  algebra and differential equations---we're going to need to cover a
  lot of material.  We can do it, but maintaining a brisk pace will be
  necessary.

  <li>Most math classes the feel of the class is fairly homogeneous.
  Some topics are a bit more difficult than others, but the class
  doesn't have any sudden shifts.  Not this class.
  We'll be covering very different topics that will feel very
  different.  

  <li>Linear algebra potentially has some <i>trap doors</i>:  things
  can suddenly shift from easy to very hard without you realizing it.
  Of course I'm going to try to not let this happen. 

  <li>For most of you this will be your first "sophomore level" math
  class, so it's a notch more advanced/abstract from that which you're
  used to.  So you might feel a little unsettled.  This is normal, and
  that sense of unsettledness might not fully go away until your
  second or third math class at this level. 
    
  <li>My experience as a student was that linear algebra seemed very
  easy. So I didn't do much work in the class. But then it got harder
  quite quickly and I was lost and in a lot of trouble. As always,
  it's important to stay caught up, because you can get left behind
  pretty quickly in a course like this. 

  <li>Also, when I took linear algebra I remember thinking that the
  material was kinda silly and that I would never use it. However, I
  ended up using linear algebra in almost every math and physics class
  I took, and I used it in my research all the time---much more than I
  use calculus. Some of the applications of linear algebra might not
  be apparent immediately, but please believe me when I say that it is
  a very useful topic to know.  

  <li>Introductory linear algebra is at times an odd mixture of
  tedious and straightforward calculations and austere and potentially
  difficult abstractions.  It has a very different feel to it than
  calculus.  I think most of you will enjoy it.

  <p>nuts and bolts and further thoughts on the class</b>
  <h2>About this Course</h2>
</header>

<ul>
<li>There will be weekly assignments that you'll turn in at the end of
  the day Friday.  (I come to campus Saturday late morning and
  retrieve assignments.)
<li>We'll do some sort of a low-stakes in-class (but probably open
  notes) midterm during the middle of the term.  I don't anticipate
  there being a final exam. 
<li>I do not expect all of the assignments to be easy.  You'll want to
  take advantage of help sessions and I also suggest working
  collaboratively.  There is no TA for this class, so we'll have to
  work to find times for help sessions that work for everyone,
  including non-COA students.  I'm open to experimenting with online
  help sessions.
<li>An added challenge is that I will be on campus less than usual
  this term.  I'll be traveling some due to my work with the Santa Fe
  Institute, and I also have some significant dental scheduled for
  week two.  We 
<li>Your evaluation will be based roughly as follows:

      </tfoot>-->
    </table>
  </div>

<li>If winter weather conditions make it unsafe for you to come to campus, do 
not come to class, even if classes have not been officially canceled.
</ul>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>collaboration vs copying, and other details</b>
  <h2>Homework</h2>
</header>
<ul>
<li>  Any code that you submit should be uploaded to our shared google drive.  
  Please don't email me code.  Thanks.
<li>On the one hand, coding is a solitary activity. You need to learn how to
write code on your own.  On the other hand, coding is a collaborative activity;
one often discusses ideas and strategies with friends and colleagues.  
Additionally, one sometimes grabs snippets of code from the web or even an
entire program.  
<li> Try to do as much coding on your own as possible.  Especially in the
first half of the course, write from scratch, or by starting with code
we work on together in class. 
<li>Never hesitate to talk about coding ideas or challenges or strategies
with others. It's ok to get help debugging, but resist the urge to get 
help immediately every time.  Debugging is an important skill.  As the
course progresses, you'll get better at it.
<li>If you share code with others, that's ok, but I'd encourage you to not
do this often.  If you do look at others' code and/or look at code on the
web, be sure to cite your sources via comments in your code.  If at all
possible, make sure you understand the code you use.  Sometimes that's
not possible, in which case you should note as much via a comment in your code.
