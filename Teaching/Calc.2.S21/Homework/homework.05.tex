\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: Edfinity}. There are no Edfinity problems
this week.\\
%Do Homework 03A, and 03B,
%which you will find on your edfinity account.  I recommend doing the
%edfinity part of the homework first.  This will enable you to benefit
%edfinity's instant feedback before you do part two.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  around 30 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
  is challenging.)
%\item Do problem 40 in pairs. Work with someone else in the class
%  and hand in only one solution for the two of you.
%\item If you want, you can do all the problems in pairs and hand
%  in only one set of solutions.\\
