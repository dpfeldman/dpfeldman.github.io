<blockquote>
    Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
    more fun to teach than the calculus. It is like being the
    ringmaster of a great three-ring circus. It has been said that one
    can recognize the students on a college campus who have studied
    the calculus -- they are the students with no eyebrows. In utter
    astonishment at the incredible applicability of the subject, the
    eyebrows of the calculus students have receded higher and higher
    and finally vanished over the backs of their heads.

</ol>
</p>


<h3>Course Structure and Pacing</h3>

<p>This is the twelfth time I've taught this course, so on the one
  hand I have a very good feel for how this will go. But we are still
  in a pandemic, so nothing it quite normal.  This class is much
  smaller than I'm used to.  I'm hoping this well let us do lots of
  interactive exercises and mini-projects in class. 
  <ul>
    <li>It will take me a little while to get used to the mechanics
    of the class: writing with a sharpie on paper instead of a
    chalkboard, looking for questions in the chat, etc. Your patience
      and feedback is appreciated. </li>
    <li>It will also take time for me to figure out the pace of the
    class: how much we can comfortably cover in sixty minutes on
      Zoom.</li>
    <li>In addition to zoom, it is easy to for me to make videos
    presenting content or working through examples. We can adjust the
    ratio of recorded content to live zoom as needed.</li>
    <li>This class meets three times a week instead of the usual
    two. This gives us of flexibility, room to experiment, and the
    ability to take a snow day or two.</li>  
    <li>Ruminations on help sessions are below in a separate
      section.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="no-box">
  There are four parts to this class (corresponding to the first
  four chapters in the textbook), each with a distinct feel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduction to the integral. This part of the course is largely
  conceptual and will involve some numerical work and graphical
  reasoning. This part of the course will be slightly tedious at
  time.  (Chapters 5-6.) </li>

  <li>Shortcuts to evaluating the integral. This is the most
  algebra-intensive portion of the course and in some ways may feel
  the most traditional. (Chapter 7.) </li>

  <li>Applications of integrals. Here we will learn several different
  ways that integrals are used in various areas of math and
  science. This is the most applied part of the course. (Chapter 8. We
  won't cover all the chapters; which ones we do will depend on
  student interest.) </li>

  <li>Sequences and series. This is a topic that is largely separate
  from the rest of the course. It has a different feel to it. The
  material can be a little difficult, but most students find it a nice
  change of pace and a good way to end the term. (Chapters 9-10.) </li>
  </ol>

</p>


<h3>Class Meetings</h3>
<p><ol>
  <li>This class meets three times a week on zoom. Class sessions will
    vary in length but will almost never be more than an hour.</li>
  <li>Video stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>As much as possible, please keep your video turned on during
	class. This will help you stay engaged and will help me have a
	sense of how class is going. I have been teaching a long time
	and am generally good at gauging whether or not a class is
	following what I'm teaching.  But I won't be able to do this if
	I'm looking at a screen full of black rectangles.</li> 
      <li>Of course if you have connection problems or if you need to turn
	the camera off for a few minutes, that's fine.</li>
      <li>It's ok to wear pajamas to class. </li>
      <li>Pets are welcome to join in. Especially cats.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>I plan on turning on zoom at 9:30 but not starting class until
    9:45.  Please feel free to come early and hang out.  Some days I
    might still be getting ready for class.  Some days I might play some
    music (which you can mute if you don't like).  Other days I'll be
    available to chat.  Most days class will end around 10:45, but I'll
    keep zoom open until around 11:00 in case people have questions,
    want to talk, etc.</li>    
  <li>I strongly encourage you to take handwritten notes.  The
    physical component of taking notes helps to keep you engaged.  And
    taking handwritten notes requires you to do some on-the-fly
    synthesis and prioritization, deepening your understanding.</li>
  <li>During class there will frequently be times where you will work
    in small groups on problems. Figuring out the best way to do this
    on Zoom might take some trial and error.</li>
</ol>
</p>




<h3>Homework</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    math, and also this is most of what
    your evaluation will be based on.</li>
  <li>As discussed in <a href="https://youtu.be/xxv-Sxav1qQ">this
  video</a> there will be two parts to almost every homework
    assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on Edfinity</li>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	google classroom</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Edfinity is an online homework system. I use this system even
    when the world is not in a global pandemic.  There are three reasons 
    why I use Edfinity:
    <ol>
      <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	many times until you get everything correct.</li>
      <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	final answer. </li>
      <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	grading.</li>
      </ol></li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first 
    time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
    with others and seeking help if you need it.</li>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
    check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
    phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
    not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
    ever). </li>
  </ol>
  
</p>


<h3>Help Sessions</h3>
<p>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions
every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
Things that happen at help sessions: 
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
    specific questions.</li>
  <li>We can experiment with breakout rooms for folks who want to work
  together in small groups during the help session.</li>
<!--  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.-->
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>You should also feel free to reach out to me and the Teaching
  Assistants with questions. If you're stuck on a problem, it might
  help to take a photo of what you've done so far and include it in an
  email to us. We might be able to help you with a short email, or we
  could set up a time to meet on zoom</p>
      


<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown.
</p>





<h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <p class="no-box">
    <!--Roughly...
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 70 percent.
<li><b>Midterm:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>-->
<p class="no-box">
I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.  This is an unusual time.
I'd strongly consider taking this class without letter grades.
Perhaps for some of you not having letter grades will reduce anxiety.
I'm happy to talk through options if anyone wants. 
</p>

  
  
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>We will be using the following textbook for Calculus I in winter
  2021 and Calculus II in spring 2021: 5th edition, Hughes-Hallett et
  al, Calculus.  Single variable.  Paperback:  ISBN-10: 0470089156.
  ISBN-13: 978-0470089156 Hardcover:  ISBN-10: 0470131594.  ISBN-13:
  978-0470131596.</p>

<p>There are many different editions of this book.  When you buy it,
  be sure you are getting the correct one.  The best way to do this is
  to search for it via the ISBN.  The ISBN is unique for each version
  of the book.  E.g., the 3rd and 4th version of the same book will
  have different ISBNs.</p> 

<p>This book costs as much as $120 dollars if you buy it new.
  However, you can get a used copy of the book for around $5 online
  plus a few dollars for shipping.  Yup.  For under $10 you can get
  your very own copy of an excellent calculus textbook.</p> 

<p>Why is the book so inexpensive?  The edition of the book that we're
  using is not the newest edition.  As a result, there are many, many
  used copies available online.  Most colleges have already switched
  editions, but I thought it didn't make sense to, since so far as I
  can tell there is no significant difference between the different
  editions, other than switching around the exercises.  (The only
  reason publishers come out with new editions of calculus textbooks
  is to undercut the used book market.  Calculus itself hasn't changed
  in over a century.)</p> 

<p>To find the book online go to amazon.com or abe.com (or your
  favorite used bookseller) and search using one of the ISBNs
  above. </p> 
  

  
<h3>Official Syllabus</h3>
<p>
A one-page listing of the topics we'll cover in this course can be
found <a href="./calc2_syllabus.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
  

<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 4 hr/wk "in" class,
      2 hr/wk reading, 9 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
