\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework 01 which you will find
on your
\href{https://webwork-hosting.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es1026i-fall2023}{WeBWorK
  page}.  I recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the 
homework first.  This will enable you to benefit from WeBWorK's
instant, if not necessarily friendly, feedback before you do part two.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  around 45 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
  is challenging.)
%\item Do problem 40 in pairs. Work with someone else in the class
%  and hand in only one solution for the two of you.
%\item If you want, you can do all the problems in pairs and hand
%  in only one set of solutions.\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent There is just one textbook problem this week:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
\item Chapter 1, problem 1.2, on page 14.  You can find a scan of
  this problem \href{http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.F23/pdf/page_14.pdf}{here}.
\end{itemize}
