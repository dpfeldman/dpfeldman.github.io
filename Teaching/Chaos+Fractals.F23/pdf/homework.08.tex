\noindent There are two parts to this assignment!\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}. Do homework 08 on the 
\href{https://webwork-hosting.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es1026i-fall2023}{WeBWorK
  page}.\\
%I recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the  
%homework first.  This will enable you to benefit from WeBWorK's
%instant, if not necessarily friendly, feedback before you do part two.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment. 
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom. %Please don't
%  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
%  around 55 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
%  is challenging.)
\end{itemize}
