I have several goals for this course.  
<ol>
  <li>I want you to gain a solid introduction to the core elements of
  C++, including pointers and classes.
  <li>I want to develop a careful, systematic, and effective
  programming style and to use programming to hone your intellect. 
  <li>I want you to gain experience creating and implementing
  algorithms and be able to apply algorithmic thinking and programming
  skills to areas of your interest.
  <!--<li>I would like you to gain an initial exposure to linked lists,
  trees, and other data structures.-->
  <li>I want you to experience the challenge and excitement of
  creating and implementing your own programs.
</ol>

<p>Our main text will be <a class=underline href="./book.html">Walter
Savitch, <em>Problem Solving with C++</em></a>.  We will cover at
least the first ten chapters of this book.  I would like to be able to
cover a few more, but I'm not sure if we'll have time.</p>

<p>Your evaluation will be based almost exclusively on the weekly
programming assignments.  There may also be a medium-sized programming
project toward the end of the term.  We will decide as a class during
the midterm evaluation if we want to do this or not.
I will assign grades (for those who so opt)
by following the guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have
any quota of A's, B's, etc.  In general, I strongly recommend against
grades; I believe they are more likely than not to interfere with
genuine, reflective learning.  </p>

Policies and Course Details:
<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a class=underline href="./index.html">
http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Comp_Sci.06</a>.</li>

<li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More
than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me likely
mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
lowering of your grade.</li>

<li>Important information about homework can be found here: <a
class=underline a href="./hommework.policies.html">homework
expectations</a>.</li>

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
class=underline
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/academic.misconduct.html">revised
statement on academic integrity</a> passed by the faculty several
winters ago.</li> 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
information via email, it is important that you check your email
regularly.</li>

<li>I expect this course to entail a lot of work.  Don't fall behind.</li>

<li>I expect you to attend class, unless we make other arrangements.</li>

<li>If winter weather conditions make it unsafe for you to come to
campus, do not come to class, even if classes have not been officially
cancelled.  </li>

</li><li>Further thoughts on this course and advice for learning to 
program can be found <a class=underline
href="./how.learn.programming.html">here</a>.
