<h1 align=center>Thoughts about this Course and How to Learn
Programming</h1> 
<h2 align=center><a href="./index.html">Introduction to Computer Science
</a></h2>

This is the first time I've taught computer programming as a course.
As such, I'm less certain than usual how the class will go.  For the
course to be a success, honest feedback will be especially important.
Here are some initial general thoughts about how to go about learning
programming and some specific thoughts about the course. 

<ol>

<li> The only way to learn programming is to do it.  A lot.  I suppose
that this is true about learning just about anything.  But it seems
somehow more true for programming than some other areas.

<li>I have never taken a programming class.  I learned C++ mostly on
my own, but had help from some friends and colleagues who are very
good programmers.  I do not consider myself to be an expert
programmer, although I am certainly not a beginner, either. 

<li> I will use class time to explain general concepts and some
particularly tricky or subtle aspects of coding.  I will follow the
textbook fairly closely.  However, my aim will be to complement the
text and not duplicate it.  It will be essential for you to spend a
fair amount of time thoughtfully reading the book.  I think the book
is well written and is almost always quite clear.  There are
definitely some sections that you can skim, but I suspect that you'll
want to read most of it.

<li>This class likely will be a lot of work at time.  It is difficult
to estimate how long it will take you to complete a programming
exercise.  This is the nature of programming.  Sometimes a program
compiles on the first try.  Other times it may take days.  Learning to
struggle and cope with this is part of the course. 

<li>Particularly at first, you won't understand everything.  I think
the best thing to do is to blast ahead anyway.  When learning a spoken
language, it is inevitable that you'll have to use grammatical
constructions that at first you don't understand.  Only after you've
learned quite a few things does the logic of the language come into
view.  I think learning a programming language is similar.  Don't feel
like you have to be perfectly comfortable with one chapter before
going on to the next. 

<li>If you're not keen on C++, don't worry.  Once you know one
language it is relatively easy to pick up an additional language.
(Learning to program isn't the same thing as learning a particular
language.)

<li>Some of the programming exercises might be a little tedious.  It
will be a while before you'll be able to code up anything really
interesting or new.  I don't think there is any way around this.
However, by the end of the course you should be able to write your
own, reasonably complex original programs.  You should have a fairly
large number of working programs that you can use as templates and
starting points for other programs that you might want to write in the
future. 

<li>I hope after this class many of you will use programming as part
of your academic or non-academic work.  

<li>Programming is an art as much as a science.  Effective programming
involves creativity and originality; it is not simply a technical
skill.

<li>Programming is also a "state of mind."  To program effectively
requires patience, focus, and motivation.  This state of mind has been
likened to that which is gained in practicing certain sorts of martial
arts.

<h4>Others' thoughts</h4>

Here are some essays on how to learn programming, how to learn to
be a hacker, and generally how to learn.  I don't agree with all
recommendations, but these make quite interesting reading.
