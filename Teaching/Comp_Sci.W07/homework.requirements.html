<h1 align=center>Homework Regulations, Guidelines, and Expectations</h1>

<h2 align=center><a href="./index.html">Introduction to Computer Science
</a></h2>



<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>While you are encouraged to talk with other students about the
homework you <b>must not copy or share code</b>.  Do not show your
code to others and do not look at other students' code.  You should
also not copy code from the web or anywhere else.  If you submit an
assignment with code that is not your own, you will fail that
assignment.  If you do this more than once, you will fail the
course.</p>

<p>In general, it is fine to talk with others about any aspect of the
assignments.  But you should not share code or pseudocode under unless
I have explicitly said that it is ok to do so.  If you get help,
advice, inspiration from someone in the class or from some other
source you <b>must</b> acknowledge that source.  Do so directly in
your source code.  Indicate what sort of help you got.  If the source
is a book or a website, include enough information so that someone
reading your code can get access to it. </p>

<h4>Style</h4>

<p> In life, opinions tend to differ about what constitutes good style.
This is true in programming, but to a much lesser degree.  There are a
number of style conventions that are almost universal (and for good
reason), and you should use them in all your programs.  I will not
enforce a particular style in this class.  However, it is very, very
important that you develop a consistent style.</p>

<p>For this class I will use and evaluate your programs based on the 
<a class=underline
href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/cs12/cs12_04spr/requirements/coding_standards.html">coding
standards written up for the into computer science sequence at the
University of California, Riverside</a>. Our textbook also has
excellent style advice.</p>

<h4>Evaluation Rubric</h4>

<p>I will evaluate your programs using the following as a guideline.  


<ol>
<li><b>Excellent</b>:  Program compiles without errors.  Runs without
errors and gives correct output.  The output is formatted so as to be
easy to read. Meets all specifications.  Is
clearly and thoroughly comments and is easy to read by someone who
does not know in advance what the program is supposed to do.  The
program is not overly long and it runs efficiently.  Where
appropriate, the program is written in such a way so as to be
(re)usable in other programs.

<li><b>Good</b>:  Program compiles with few errors.  Runs without
errors and gives generally correct output, although may contain a few
logical errors, especially concerning special cases. Meets almost all
specifications.  Output is fairly
easy to read.  Contains thorough comments and the program is generally
easy to understand.  

<li><b>Fair</b>: Program compiles with some errors.  Program runs but
contains logical errors and/or minor run-time errors.  Program is
poorly commented and is difficult to understand.  Meets only some
program specifications. 

<li><b>Unacceptable</b>: Program does not compile or it compiles but
contains run-time errors that render it useless.  Contains no or few
comments.  Is difficult to understand. 
</ol>
