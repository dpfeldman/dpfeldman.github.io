<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 18 January</b><p>
<br>



<b>Chapter E1:</b>
<ol>
<li>E1R.1
</ol>
 
<b>Chapter E2:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>E2B.2 
<li>E2B.4 
<li>E2B.8 
<li>E2S.2  Hint:  Follow the hints given in the text!

<li>E2S.5  We're essentially gonna do this problem in lab, so
        you might want to wait until lab to do this.  If you want to
        try it on your own, you'll need the handy approximation we
        discussed last lab.

<li>E3S.1

<b>Bonus/Challenge Problems/Other things to try</b>
<ol>
<li>E1R.3.  Good for getting a feel for what a Coulomb is.  
<li>E2S.4.   For the "Prove" part of the question you should
        use algebra.  To do so, I suggest the following tips.  First,
        you'll need to consider three cases, when the point is between
        the charges, when it's to the left of both charges, and when
        it's to the right of both charges.  Treat each case separately.
        Also, I think it will be much easier if you set things up so that
        each variable is positive.
<li>E2A.2.  More fun with the binomial approximation.
<li>E2R.1.  A neat and useful geometric trick for calculating fields.
</ol>
