<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
As our primary text we will use the <a
href="http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas">Six Ideas</a> 
books by <a href="http://pages.pomona.edu/~tmoore/">Tom
Moore</a>.  We will cover part of unit E and part of unit R.
<p>

I have several goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to gain a firm understanding of the main ideas of
special relativity, and get a broad introduction to electricity and
magnetism. 

<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want you to learn independently about a topic of your choosing.
I want you to gain experience orally presenting technical
information. 

</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be roughly based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Presentation:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
<li><b>Lab:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
in <a href="http://www.coa.edu/catalog/academic/records.html">the COA
Course Catalog.</a> I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br> 

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Physics.2.W00">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Physics.2.W00</a>.
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will likely result in me mentioning
this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your
grade.   
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>There will be a midterm exam which will be open notes, open book,
and (essentially) untimed.  You may not, however, get any help from
any humans during the exam.  

<li>Instead of a final exam, you'll do an end-of-the term project.
Information on what is expected for 
your final presentation can be 
found <a href="projects.html">in a separate document</a>. 
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading, and come prepared with written questions.  Click <a
href="preparation.html">here</a> for details.  
<li>In order to make time for final presntations, we'll need to
schedule a few extra classes toward the end of the term.
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  
<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  
<li>I expect you to attend class and labs.  
<li>Do you want to do one or more mini-projects in lab, like we did in
Physics I? 
<li>Info about labs can be found <a href="./labs.html">here</a>. 
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
