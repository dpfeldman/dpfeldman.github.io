<h1 align=center> Physics II Final Presentations</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

Here are some guidelines for your final presentation:

<ul>
<li>Your presentation should be 15-20 minutes, with some time
afterwards for questions.
<li>The research for your presentation should be done over several
weeks, not over one weekend.
<li>You should consult more than one reference.
<li>Can be on (almost) any topic about math or physics.  It doesn't
need to be on something directly related to physics II.  You can also
research about the history, philosophy, or sociology of science if you
want.  
<li>Start thinking about a topic now.  ILL your books early.
<li>You will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>How well you understand your topic.  You should strive for a
balance of breadth and depth.
<li>How well you present your material.
</ol>
<li>In your presentation, just focus on one or two interesting ideas.
You don't have to give a complete, comprehensive lecture.  
<li>During the middle of the term we'll talk some about how to give a
good scientific presentation.
<li>At the end of the term, you should hand in an annotated
bibliography.  Additionally, I'll probably ask for a few paragraphs
from you reflecting on the project. 
<li>You can do an alternative project if you want, but you must let me
know soon if you plan on doing so.
</ul>
