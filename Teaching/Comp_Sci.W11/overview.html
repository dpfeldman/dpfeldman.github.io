<h3>Official Description</h3>
<p class="no-box"><br>
This course is an intensive introduction to computer science for
students with little or no programming experience. The primary goal
for this course is to provide students with a solid foundation in
Python, a modern, high-level, object-oriented programming language. A
secondary goal is for students to gain an initial introduction to
algorithmic approaches to interdisciplinary
problem-solving. Constructing effective software involves considerable
creativity and judgment, and there are general theoretical principles
and practical considerations that inform and guide this
construction. Students will gain an introduction to these general
principles and will also gain experience applying these principles to
practical problems. Students who successfully complete this class
will: gain a solid, practical understanding of the core python
language, including control statements, functions, simple data
structures, and input/output; learn how to extend their knowledge of
python or other languages; develop good programming techniques; and be
able apply algorithmic thinking and programming skills to areas of
their interest. This course is designed for students interested in
using programming in a wide range of areas, including as a tool for
research in biology, economics, statistics, and other mathematical
sciences. Additionally, this class will help prepare students to write
web applications or applications for mobile devices. This course is
also well suited for students who do not have a particular area of
programming application in mind, but who simply wish to experience the
challenge and excitement of designing and implementing
algorithms. Evaluation will be based on weekly programming exercises
and a final programming project. Level: Introductory. Prerequisites:
none. Lab Fee: none. Class size: 12. <b>QR</b> <b>ES</b>.

<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p class="no-box"><br>
As our primary text we will use <i>Python Programming: An
      Introduction to Computer Science</i>, second edition, by
John Zelle.  Be sure you have the second edition and not the first
edition of the book.  I would like to cover most of the topics in the
book.  
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Programming Assignments:</b> 65 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 30 percent.
<li><b>Participation in Discussions:</b> 5 percent.
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.  But I also
understand that many students believe (perhaps correctly) that grades
will make it easier to get into graduate or professional school.
</p>


<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
  it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
  every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  This means they will be of
significantly less use to you on exams.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>Important information about the programming assignments can be
  found here: <a href="./homework.requirements.html">homework
  requirements</a>.  

<li>If winter weather conditions make it unsafe for you to come to
  campus, do not come to class, even if classes have not been
  officially cancelled.  

<li>This class has three meeting times every week, although we will
  not always use all three sessions.  For some class sessions we will
  discuss a paper or presentation, sometimes with a guest speaker.
  Attendance at these sessions is expected; attendance at other class
  sessions is suggested but not required.  

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
    hearing; see the academic handbook for details.  Possible
    consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion.
