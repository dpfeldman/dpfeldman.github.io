<h3>Homework Requirements and Guidelines</h3>

<p class="no-box"><br>
<b>Collaboration:</b>
While you are encouraged to talk with other students about the
homework you must not copy or share code. Do not show your code to
others and do not look at other students' code. You should also not
blindly copy large chunks of code from the web or anywhere else. </p>

<p class="no-box">In general, it is fine to talk with others about any
  aspect of the assignments.  But you should not share code or
  pseudocode under unless I have explicitly said that it is ok to do
  so. If you get help, advice, inspiration from someone in the class
  or from some other source you must acknowledge that source. Do so
  directly in your source code. Indicate what sort of help you got. If
  the source is a book or a website, include enough information so
  that someone reading your code can get access to it.  
</p><br><br>


<p class="no-box">
<b>Style:</b>
In life, opinions tend to differ about what constitutes good
style. This is true in programming, but to a much lesser degree. There
are a number of style conventions that are almost universal (and for
good reason), and you should use them in all your programs. I will not
enforce a particular style in this class. However, it is very, very
important that you develop a consistent style and learn to write
readable and logical code. </p>
<br><br> 


<p class="no-box">
<b>Evaluation:</b>
I will evaluate your programs using the following as a guideline 
<ul>
<li><b>Excellent</b>:  Program compiles without errors.  Runs without
errors and gives correct output.  The output is formatted so as to be
easy to read. Meets all specifications.  Is
clearly and thoroughly commented and is easy to read by someone who
does not know in advance what the program is supposed to do.  The
program is not overly long and it runs efficiently.  Where
appropriate, the program is written in such a way so as to be
(re)usable in other programs.

<li><b>Good</b>:  Program compiles with few errors.  Runs without
errors and gives generally correct output, although may contain a few
logical errors, especially concerning special cases. Meets almost all
specifications.  Output is fairly
easy to read.  Contains thorough comments and the program is generally
easy to understand.  

<li><b>Fair</b>: Program compiles with some errors.  Program runs but
contains logical errors and/or minor run-time errors.  Program is
poorly commented and is difficult to understand.  Meets only some
program specifications. 

<li><b>Poor</b>: Program does not compile or it compiles but
contains run-time errors that render it useless.  Contains no or few
comments.  Is difficult to understand.
