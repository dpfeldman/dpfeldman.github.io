\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework00 and Homework01 which you
will find on the WeBWorK page here:
\url{https://webwork-hosting.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es1024-fall2024}. I 
recommend doing the WeBWorK part of the homework first. This will
enable you to benefit WeBWorK's instant, if somewhat terse, feedback
before you do part two.\\ 


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Non-WeBWorK problems}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type this assignment.
\item Please show your work clearly. Thanks.
\item If you like working on a tablet, go for it. 
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.
\item If you want, you can do the non-WeBWorK problems in pairs and
  submit only one assignment for the two of you. \\
\end{itemize}

\noindent Here are some non-WeBWorK problems.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Determine an equation for the linear function that generates
    the values in the table below.  

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|| l | l ||}
\hline $x$ & $f(x)$ \\
\hline
5.2 & 27.8 \\
5.3 & 29.2 \\
5.4 & 30.6 \\
5.5 & 32.0 \\
5.6 & 33.4 \\

\end{tabular}

\item The graph of Fahrenheit temperature, F, as a function of Celsius
  temperature, C, is a line.  We know that 212 F and 100 C are the
  same; this is the temperature at which water boils (under standard
  pressure).  And we also know that 32 F and 0 C are the same; this is
  the temperature at which water freezes.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the slope of the graph?
  \item What is the equation of the line?  (I.e., F as a function of
    C.)
  \item Use the equation to find what Fahrenheit temperature
    corresponds to 20 C.
  \item What temperature is the same number of degrees in both C and
    F?
  \end{enumerate}

  \item The cost of planting a crop is usually a function of the
    number of acres sown. The cost of the equipment is a \emph{fixed
      cost}, because it must be paid regardless of the number of
    acres planted. The cost of supplies and labor varies with the
    number of acres planted and is called the \emph{variable cost}.
    Supposed the fixed costs of \$10,000 and the variable costs are
    \$200 per acre. Let $C$ represent the total cost of planting $x$
    acres of a crop.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find a formula for $C$ as a function of $x$.
    \item Graph the function.
    \item Which feature on the graph (slope or y-intercept) represents
      the fixed cost?  Which represents the variable cost?
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
