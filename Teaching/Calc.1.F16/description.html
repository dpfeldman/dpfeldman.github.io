<h3>Informal Description</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
Here is some additional information and advice to give you a
better idea what to expect from this class, how to enjoy it and do
well, and help you decide whether or not this class is for you.  
</b>

<ul>

<li>This is the tenth time I have taught this class, so I have a
  pretty good feel for how it will go. <br><br>

<li>This class will probably be quite large by COA standards.  You 
and I will need to work together creatively to make sure that this 
classtime is comfortable and effective, and that outside of class 
people are able to get all the help they need.  I have taught this 
class with more than thirty students and it worked out fine.<br><br>

<li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea.  If you're
confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
sooner rather than later.  There are many people around who can offer
help.  However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know who needs
it when.  You need to take responsibility to seek help if you need
it.  On a related note ... <br><br>

<li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I don't
expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first time.
Don't let yourself get frustrated -- I strongly suggest working with 
others and seeking help if you need it. <br><br>

<li> I will be traveling this term more than usual. I will not be
  missing any classes, but I'll be away several weekends, which will
  mean leaving campus on Friday around noon.  I traditionally do a
  help session Friday afternoons, but I will not be able to do so
  regularly this term.  <br><br>

<li> In many more traditional math classes the textbook has a ton of
examples in them.  The book we'll be using doesn't.  The result is
that students sometimes find the homework to be challenging,
frustrating, and occasionally even annoying.  However, I'm convinced
that this style of homework -- where there's not an example just like
the problem you're trying to do -- is much better pedagogically.  
You'll learn a lot more this way. <br><br>

<li>Each week part of your assignment will be done using an online
  homework system. We will use WeBWorK, a system developed by the
  Mathematical Association of America. It has been in use for quite a
  few years and is used at many colleges and universities. There are
  several advantages to an online system:  
<ol>
  <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can learn
    right away from your mistakes. And on most problems you can submit
    solutions many times until you get everything correct. 
  <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, the TAs and I can
    spend more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
    grading. 
  <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get slightly
  different versions of the questions. This means that collaborating
  with other students will be maximally effective, since you'll have
  to share solution methods and not just the final answer.   
</ol>
I am quite confident that using WeBWorK is a good idea; I've used it
  in another class and it worked well.  That said, WeBWorK can be a
  bit fussy/frustrating sometimes.  If you are struggling with the
  system, please don't get frustrated: ask for assistance.<br><br>

<li>In addition to me presenting ideas and examples, there will
frequently be problems to work on in small groups in class.  Use this
time well -- it is a chance to try out some ideas and get on the right 
track before starting the homework. <br><br>

<!--<li>I will make a 10-15 minute video that you will need to watch
before each class. I will try to get the video posted at least a day
in advance.  The idea is that if you watch the video beforehand I can
spend less time lecturing and we will have more time in class to 
discuss interesting problems and work together in groups. This is the
first time I've tried something like this, but I'm pretty confident
that it will work well.<br><br>-->

<li>You may need to read the textbook in order to do some of
the homework.  I won't be able to cover everything in class, or
you might wish to see a topic explained in a different way. <br><br> 

<li> I very strongly recommend getting your own copy of the textbook.
I think you'll learn more if you have your own copy to take notes in
and always have with you when you're doing problems.  <br><br>

<li>This class is a lot of work, but the work is fairly steady from
  week to week.  <br><br> 


<li>There are four parts to the class, each with a distinct
  feel.<br><br> 
<ol>
  <li>Review of functions.  This may seem both too slow and too fast
  at the same time.  The last week of this part of the class is always
  difficult.  Experience has shown, however, that the review of
  functions is definitely worth it.  It is essential for the rest of
  the course. <br><br>
 
  <li>Introduction to the derivative.  Here we will learn what the
  derivative is and what it means.  This is more conceptual and
  sometimes seems odd to those used to less conceptual and more
  algebraic ways of thinking about math. <br><br>

  <li>Techniques of differentiation.   Having learned what the
  derivative is, we now learn lots of short cuts to calculate it.
  This part of the class is the most traditional, in that you'll learn
  some formulas and techniques, and then do lots of practice of those
  techniques. <br><br>

  <li>Applications of derivatives.  Here we will learn several
  different ways derivatives get used.  This is the most applied part
  of the course.  It is somewhat more difficult, but most students
  find it the most interesting, too, and a good way to end the class.
