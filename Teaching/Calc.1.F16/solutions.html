<h3>Homework Solutions</h3>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Problem write-ups are your permanent record of your understanding
of the material covered. You will find your homework solutions to be
very helpful when working on the exams.  Thus, you'll want to make
your solutions complete enough so that you can understand them a month
or so after you wrote them.  <br><br>


<li>Solutions should be clearly and logically presented.  This means
that:
<ol>
<li>Your method should always be clear.  It should be easy to figure
out what you're doing and why.
<li>Use a lot of space.  I recommend skipping some lines if you use
lined paper.  
<li>Equations should usually be accompanied by prose.  Before plunging
into algebra, state what it is you're solving for.  If there are any
non-obvious steps in a calculation, explain them.
<li>If you made an interesting mistake before finding the solution,
  you might want to include that in your write-up, so that you don't
  make the same mistake again. 
<li>Write equations in a logical order. <br>
</ol><br>

<li>Solutions should stand on their own; they should be understandable
to someone who hasn't read the problem.  <b>This means that in most
cases you should
paraphrase the question before writing your response.</b><br><br>

<li>The reason I emphasize writing up your problem solutions clearly
  and thoroughly  is not because I am a neat freak or
  that I want to impose a style on you.  Rather, I am convinced (and
  there is evidence in support of this proposition), that the act of
  writing helps to focus one's thoughts and engages your mind, leading
  to more enduring learning.<br><br>

<li>An important part of improving your problem-solving skills is
  developing a style or a system.  This way when you are faced with a
  problem you don't know how to solve, you know how to act like you do
  know how to solve it.  You'd be amazed at what a difference this
  makes.<br><br> 

<li>When doing WeBWorK problems, I strongly suggest printing out a pdf
  of the assignment and doing your work on paper, and then submitting
  your solutions.  Working on paper is a lot easier than staring at a
  screen, and for many problems you'll want to have a record of your
  methods and thinking when you're working on the exams. <br><br>

<li>I will not give numerical grades on HW assignments.  Instead, I
will give a letter grade and try to include as many comments as I
can.  I'm mainly interested in seeing that you thoughtfully attacked
the problem and wrote it up in a clear and coherent way.  It is better 
to be clear and wrong than unclear and right.  If you only
want comments and don't want a letter grade on your HW, please write
a note to this effect on the top of your assignment.<br><br> 

<li>The TAs for the class will help me with grading assignments.  They
  will read over your assignment and mark things right or wrong and
  add some suggestions or corrections.  I will also read over your
  assignments, possibly make some additional comments, and will assign
  the grade.  The TAs will not play a role in grading your exams; I
  will grade these on my own.<br><br>

<li> Finally, a few minor requests:
<ol>
<li>On the top of the homework, please write the assignment number and 
the course name.
<li>If you don't have a stapler, that's ok.  But please don't mangle
and fold over the corner in an attempt to get the pages to stick
together.  Just write your name or initials on all pages and I'll
gladly staple them together.
<li>Please don't hand in problems on paper that has been torn out of a
spiral notebook. 
<li>Please do the problems in order.  If you do them out of order,
  please indicate this on your assignment and make it so that it's not
  hard to find them.  Grading your homework should not be a scavenger
  hunt. 
</ol>
Thanks.
