For many of the
problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it still
might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning.<br> <br>

<b>Note:  The list below should be interpreted as follows:  the first
problem in the assignment is problem 2 from chapter 1.1; the second
problem in the assignment is problem 5 from chapter 1.1, and so on.</b>

<h4>Chapter 1.1:</h4>
<ol>
<li>2. 
<li>5. 
<li>9.
<li>10. No explanations necessary. 
<li>17. No explanations necessary. 
<li>18.
<li>22-24. No explanations necessary. 
<li>25.  No explanations necessary. 
<li>27.  No explanations necessary.  (Be careful -- this one is
slightly trickey.)
<li>29.
<li>32. 
<li>36. 
</ol>

<h4>Chapter 1.2:</h4>
<ol>
<li>1-4. No explanations necessary.
<li>6.

<li>16.
<li>19.
<li>32.
<li>36.
</ol>


<h4>Maple Exercises:</h4>

<!--Maple should be on the desktop of all PCs in the computer
labs.  Double click on the icon and, after a little bit of whirring, a
maple icon will appear.  Maple commands are fairly intuitive, but they
do take a little getting used to.  Maple has some pretty good built-in
tutorials.  A decent tutorial on plotting with maple can be found <a
href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~meade/math242/maple/day19.html#MapleAutoBookmark9">here</a>;
ignore the stuff about putting titles on plots, though.  For Maple
help from a real live human, talk to one of the teaching assistants or 
me.  I also
recommend looking at the page of <a href="../../Maple/">Maple Help</a>
that I've put together. <p> -->
<ol>
<li>Use Maple to evaluate 10^(2.7).  (I.e., "ten to the two point
seven power.")  Have maple express the answer as a decimal.  
<li>Use Maple to plot a cool function, and then print out the plot.
Be sure to say why you think the function is cool.
</ol>
