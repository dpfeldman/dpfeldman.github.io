<blockquote>
I would...urge that people be introduced to [chaos] early in their
mathematical education.  [Chaos] can be studied phenomenologically by
iterating it on a calculator, or even by hand.  Its study does not
involve as much conceptual sophistication as does elementary
calculus.  Such study would greatly enrich the student's intuition.
Not only in research, but also in the everyday world of politics and
economics, we would all be better off if more people realised that
simple nonlinear systems do not necessarily possess simple dynamical
properties.

<h3>Course Goals</h3><br>
<ul>
  <li>I want you to gain a solid understanding of the basic mathematical
    ideas behind chaos and fractals.  As part of this, I hope you'll leave
    this course thinking somewhat differently about order and disorder,
    simplicity and complexity.
  <li>I want to help you improve your basic facility with algebra and
    functions, your problem solving skills, your ability to create and
    interpret different types of graphs, and your overall mathematical
    confidence.
  <li>I want you to gain a sense of how math and physics is done, and
    gain an awareness that these are not static, "dead" disciplines.  I
    want you to gain a greater understanding of science as an institution
    and science as a culture.
</ul>
