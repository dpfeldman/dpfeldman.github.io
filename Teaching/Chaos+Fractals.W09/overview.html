<h3>Texts</h3>
<ol>
<li><i>Chaos: Making a New
Science</i> by <a href="http://www.around.com/">James Gleick</a>.
This is a popular science book and is not a traditional text.
<li>A draft of <i>Introduction to Chaos and Fractals</i>, by <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu">David Feldman</a>, forthcoming, 2010,
Oxford University Press. I will hand out a 
copy of the draft in class, and later in the term will probably hand
out some additional chapters. 
<li>Toward the end of the term we'll read a number of short papers,
and quite likely a short story and some poetry.  The exact assignments
will depend on the interests of the class.
</ol>

<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>


<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 45 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 25 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Short Papers:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more likely than not to
interfere with genuine, reflective learning.  However, I will assign
grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines in the COA
Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc. </p>


<h3>Class Structure and Policies</h3>


<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.W09">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.W09</a>.

<li>This class meets <b>both</b> the <b>ES</b> and the <b>QR</b>
requirements.  Versions of the class prior to Spring 2006 only met the
<b>QR</b> requirement.

<li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More
than one unexcused late homework assignment will likely result in me
mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
lowering of your grade.

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't copy their solution and turn it in.

<li>Guidelines for writing up homework problems can be found <a
href="./solutions.html">here</a>.

<li>There will be no exams.  However, there may be a large-ish,
synthetic assignment toward the end of the term.

<li>You will do a final project for this class.  If you wish, you can
collaborate with other students.  Although projects can take varying
forms, most will end up giving a presentation
of around 15 minutes towards the end of the term.    For
more info, see the <a href="final.guidelines.html">project
guidelines</a>.
<!-- and a <a href="final.ideas.html">list of possible project -->
<!-- topics</a>.-->

<li> There will frequently be reading assigned for class.  When this
is the case, you should prepare several questions or comments on the
reading, and get them to me by 9pm the evening before class.  Email or
paper is fine.

<li>You will write three short (2-3 page) papers exploring ideas from
    the book by Gleick and/or our discussions.  Information about
    what's expected for the short papers can be found <a
    href="./papers.html">here</a>.

<li> We may need to schedule an extra class or two during
weeks 9 or 10 so we have enough time for the presentations.

<!--<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.-->

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  Also, you will need to use the www for some of your
    assignments.

<li>Labs will meet Wednesday afternoons.  There will be very little, if
any work associated with the labs outside of the labtime itself.  Labs
will take one to two hours; we will arrange to stagger lab groups'
arrival time, as there is only one set of apparatus for most
experiments.  It is important that you attend lab and arrive on time.
It will not be possible to make up missed labs.

<li>The labs for this class were developed with the support of the
Maine Space Grant Consortium, via grant # SG-05-31.

<li>I expect you to attend class.

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as
    per pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range
    from failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty several years ago..

<li>For a more informal description of this course, see a list of
    <a href="./expectations.html">what to expect</a>.
