<br>

You should come to class with several questions and comments prepared.
Before class, while reading, you should do the following:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Write down each section heading in the chapter.
  <li>Underneath each section, make a list of what, if any,
  major questions you have about the section.  
  <li> Also, if you have any comments:  (e.g., this was cool, I had
  always thought something different, etc.) write those down too.

</ul>

We will use these questions as a basis for discussion.  During class,
as questions get answered, put a check next to them.  Don't check off
questions that you're still unclear on.  You'll hand in the sheet to
me at the end of class. <p>

This will let me know what areas students are still confused about.  I
also think that by writing out questions beforehand, we'll be able to
make more efficient use of class time.<p>

<h4>Thoughts on Reading Styer's book</h4>
<ul>
<li>I've found this book to be deceptively complex.  Styer's writing
is excellent.  But some of the phenomena he describes are so
counter-intuitive that it's easy to get confused.  The reading doesn't
amount to many pages, but it does require some thought.  I suggest
reading when you're feeling alert; Styer is kinda tough to read if
you're tired. 

<li>Styer editorializes from time to time.  This is part of what makes
this such a good book.  This doesn't mean that you (or I) will agree
with his editorializations.  Be alert for these, and be ready to
disagree (politely) with some of his (and/or my) statements.  

</ul>
