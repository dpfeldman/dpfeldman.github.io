<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday 21 January  </b><p>

<b>Chapter E2:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>E2B.2 (5 points)
<li>E2B.4 (5 points)
<li>E2B.8 (10 points)
<li>E2S.2 (15 points)  Hint:  Follow the hints given in the text!
<li>E2S.4 (15 points)  For the "Prove" part of the question you should
	use algebra.  To do so, I suggest the following tips.  First,
	you'll need to consider three cases, when the point is between
	the charges, when it's to the left of both charges, and when
	it's to the right of both charges.  Treat each case separately.
	Also, I think it will be much easier if you set things up so that
	each variable is positive.  
<li>E2S.5 (15 points)  We're essentially gonna do this problem in lab, so
	you might want to wait until lab to do this.  If you want to 
	try it on your own, you'll need the handy approximation we
	discussed last lab.
</ol>

<b>Chapter E3:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>E3B.5 (5 points)
<li>E3S.4 (10 points)
<li>E3S.7 (10 points)
</ol>
