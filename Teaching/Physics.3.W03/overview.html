<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
As our text we will use <a
href="http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/StrangeQM/">The Strange
World of Quantum Mechanics</a> by <a
href="http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/index.html">Dan Styer</a>.  
I expect that we'll cover most of the chapters in this book.<p>

We will also make use of Spins and Quantum Measurement.  This is a
short book written by Professor <a
href="http://www.physics.orst.edu/~mcintyre/">David McIntyre</a>.
These materials have been developed for a <a
href="http://www.physics.orst.edu/~mcintyre/ph425/">Spins and Quantum
Measurement</a>, a new, novel course at Oregon State University.
Thanks to David for making these notes available.  I'll give you
photocopies of these in a few weeks.
<p>

There will also be several photocopied articles that we'll read. <P> 

I have several goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to gain a firm understanding of the main ideas of
quantum mechanics.

<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, mathematical confidence, and technical writing.  

<li>I want you to think critically about science and reality.  

<li>I want you to gain experience writing and explaining physical and
mathematical phenomena carefully and precisely. 

</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be roughly based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 70 percent.
<li><b>Final Exercise:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
in <a href="http://www.coa.edu/catalog/academic/records.html">the COA
Course Catalog.</a> I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br> 

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Physics.3.W03">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Physics.3.W03</a>.
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will likely result in me mentioning
this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your
grade.  
<li>If your HW is substantially late, I may not be able to grade it
fully. I'll check off that you did it, but I might not have time to
make as many comments and suggestions as I normally do. 
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>There will be some sort of a final thing.  It could be a synthetic
final problem set, a final paper, or something else.  We will discuss
this sometime around week 3 or 4.   

<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading, and come prepared with written questions.  Click <a
href="preparation.html">here</a> for details.  
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  
<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  
<li>I expect you to attend class.  
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
