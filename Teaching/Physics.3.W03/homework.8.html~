<b>Homework 4:  Due Friday 31 January </b><p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>You have 30 fish in 30 tanks.  You want to test and see if the
fish, if put together, will fight with each other or get along
harmoniously.  To do so, you want to put a pair of fish in a special
tank and monitor them for a day.  Your colleague wants to pair up the
30 fish in each possible way.  How many days will it take to complete
this experiment?

<li>When a lobsterman catches lobsters, there is a 60% chance that the
lobsters will be big, and a 40% chance that the lobsters will be
small.  If a lobsterman catches 12 lobsters one day, what is the
probability that he catches 8 big lobsters?

<li>You have 20 CDs.  How many different ways can you arrange them on
a shelf?

<li>After an in vitro fertilization procedure (IVF) four fertilized
eggs are placed in the mother's uterus. Assume that each egg has one
chance in ten of implanting successfully, and that this is independent
of whether any of the others implants. What is the probability that
none of the eggs will implant? That a single egg will implant? That
there will be twins? That there will be triplets? That there will be
quadruplets? That there will be qunitrupulets?  (From
http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/425/ec2.html.) 


<li>Consider the complex numbers z_1 = 4 - 4i and z_2 = 2i.
<ol>
<li>Convert both number into exponential form
<li>Find z_1z_2.
<li>Find z_1z_1^*.  (I.e., z_1 times its complex conjugate.)
<li>Find z_2z_2^*.  (I.e., z_2 times its complex conjugate.)
</ol>

<b>Bonus/Challenge Problems/Other things to try</b>
<ol>
<li>A cube that is painted blue is cut into 64 equal cubes.  What is
the probability P_n that a little cube picked at random has n painted
faces, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3?  (From Garrod, Statistical Mechanics.) 
<li>Ten people throw dice, once per minute, at ten tables.  When any
person throws 12 he or she leaves.  What is the probability that
anyone will be left after one hour?   (From Garrod, Statistical
Mechanics.)  


<li> <b>Note:  this is much more difficult than the other problems.
For parts 2 and 3, a little bit of calculus is probably necessary.</b>
The new breakfast cereal, <i>Millenios</i>, consists of 
pieces in the two shapes 0 and 2.  Thus, a spoonful of
these pieces might contain a 2 and the three 0's needed to
spell 2000.  Suppose that a spoonful of n <i> Millenios</i> is
obtained from a machine that produces, independently and randomly, a
2 with probability p and a 0 with probability 1-p.  (This
situation approximates the selection of a spoonful of n pieces from
a large box full of <i> Millenios</i> in which the ratio of 2's
to 0's is p:1-p.)  (Problem 679 from the <i>College Journal of
Mathematics</i>.)  
<ol>
<li>For n=4, what value of p maximizes the probability that the
spoonful will contain the 2 and the three 0's needed to
spell 2000? 
<li> For arbitrary n >= 4, let p_n be the value of p that
maximizes the probability that a spoonful of n pieces will contain
at least one 2 and at least three 0's.  Determine p_n as
a function of n.  

<li> Find the limit of p_n from part (2) as n goes to infinity.
(It is obvious that for an p satisfying 0 < p < 1, as n goes to
infinity the probability that a spoonful of n pieces will
contain at least one 2 and at least three 0's will
approach 1.)   

</ol>
<li>In a certain country the percentages of boy babies and girl babies
born are equal under normal circumstances, and their life expectancies
are the same. But a 
tradition develops that families keep having children until a girl is
born, and then stop. (Of course, they may have to stop for other
reasons.) What is the expected ratio of males to females in the
population?  (From
http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/425/ec2.html.)
