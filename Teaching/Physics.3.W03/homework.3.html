<b>Homework 3:  Due Friday 24 January  </b><p>



<b>Styer, Chapter 5:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>5.7
<li>5.8
</ol>

<b>Styer, Chapter 6:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>6.2
</ol>

<b>Styer, Chapter 8:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>8.2
</ol>

<b>Problems mentioned in class</b>.  Both of these refer to the
version of the EPR experiment described by Styer, not Mermin.  
<ol>
<li>Suppose the left particle is measured first and the setting on the
apparatus is A.  Suppose this left measurement is +.  Show that the
probability that the right particle is measured to be + is 1/2. 
<li>Suppose the left particle is measured first and the setting on the
apparatus is B.  Suppose this left measurement is +.  Show that the
probability that the right particle is measured to be + is 1/2. 
</ol><p>

<b>Short essay</b>.  Answer only <i>one</i> of these questions.  Write
as if you're writing to another student in the 
class.  That is, assume your reader has read Styer's book and
understood most of it, but that he or she is not an expert in quantum
mechanics.  I'd guess that a good response to these questions will be
between 1 and 3 pages.  
<ul>
<li>In your own words, describe the EPR paradox.  What is it that
bothered Einstein so much?  There's no need to go into the details of
the Aspect experiment -- focus on what was paradoxical to Einstein. In
your answer, you might want to quote comments from Einstein's paper,
or Mermin or Styer.  This is fine and is probably a good thing to do
(be sure to cite your source).  However, be sure to also restate any
quotes you use. <p>

<li><i>The Ghost in the Atom</i>, edited by P.C.W.Davies and
J.R. Brown, contains interviews of Alain Aspect and John Bell.  This
book is on reserve in the library.  Read one of these interviews and
comment and/or respond.  Assume that your reader has not read the
interview, so part of your task is to summarize what you think was
important or interesting from the interview. <p>

<li>In class and in Styer's book, many of the details and experimental
challenges of Aspect's work were left out.  Read more about the
experiment and write an explanation understandable to others in the
class.  Possible things to focus on:  How are the two photons
produced?  How to the detectors actually work?  How does the
coincidence counter come into play?  To answer these, you'll need to
look at Aspect's paper, and probably some other sources.  If you're
interested in this, see me for some pointers to various references.<p>

<li>There are lots of essays on the web about EPR and such.  Find one
and write a thoughtful, constructive review of it.  Do you find any
errors?  Compare it to Mermin's article and Styer's chapter 6.  Which
would you recommend to a beginning quantum mechanics student, and why?
<i>If you choose this option, you should clear with me what you're
writing a review of before you write it.</i>

</ul>

If these all sound terrible and you have some better idea for
something you'd like to write about, let me know and we can probably
work something out.
