<br>


<b>Chapter 1, Strange World:</b>
<ol>
<li>2.1
<li>2.2

"explanation" means "explanation in terms of something more
fundamental."  
<ol>
<li>Give an example of something about which this statement is true,
and something about which this statement is false.  Write a paragraph
about each, clearly explaining your reasoning.  OR
<li>If you think Styer's view is always correct or always incorrect,
write a few paragraphs explaining why you think so.  OR
<li>If you disagree with Styer for some even more fundamental reasons,
write a few paragraphs explaining why you think so.
