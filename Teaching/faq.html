<h2>General Questions about the Quantitative Reasoning (QR) Requirement</h2>

<button class="accordion">What is the Quantitative Reasoning
  Requirement?</button> 
<div class="panel"> 
  <p>All students who enter COA with 9 credits or fewer are required
  to take at least one QR course in order to graduate. QR courses
  include, but are not limited to, math courses. Most physics classes
  and some chemistry and economics classes meet the QR requirement.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is a QR class?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A QR class is one which students engage meaningfully in
  mathematics and/or computation. This means that students
  are <em>doing</em> math or coding. QR classes usually have problem
  sets and/or coding assignments.</p> 
</div>

<button class="accordion">Are math classes my only QR option?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No. Almost all physics classes meet the QR requirement, as do
  several chemistry and geology/earth science classes. Around half of
  our economics classes also meet the QR requirement, as do almost all
    statistics, data science, and programming courses.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">When should I take my QR class?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Many students delay taking a QR course. This is certainly
  understandable. However, there are some reasons why I think it's
  better to take a QR course sooner rather than later: With a solid
  math and quantitative reasoning background, students will get much
  more out of some classes, especially science and economics
  classes.</p> 

<p>On the other hand, there may be many other courses that make more
    sense for you to take, depending on what you're trying to get out
    of COA. It's usually better to wait and take a math class that is
    better suited for you than to take a math class right away that
    isn't a good match. Students sometimes worry that the longer they
    wait to take a QR course the harder it will be. In my experience,
    this isn't the case.</p> 

<p>The bottom line is that I don't really care when you take a QR
    course. However, you can box yourself into a corner if you want
    too long and might end up having to take a course that isn't a
    good match for you.<p>
</div>


<button class="accordion">Will I get in to the QR class I want?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Probably. Many math classes essentially have no size limit, so
    you'll definitely get in.  I've never turned anyone away from the
    Physics and Math of Sustainable Energy. It is rare for first-year
    students to get into Chaos and Fractals, so you may have to wait a
    year or two for that class. Over the years I have found that
    students almost always can get into a course that is a good match
    for them.   </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Do AP credits or an IB in mathematics
  fulfill the Quantitative Reasoning Requirement?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No. AP credits or IB credits do not fulfill the QR requirement.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can I place out of the QR requirement?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No.  Regardless of whatever math you've had before you came here,you
need to take one QR course while at COA (unless you're a transfer
student.)  The idea is that all students, as part of their
interdisciplinary B.A. in human ecology, should take at least one
course that requires mathematics or computation.  
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can I use transfer credits to meet the QR
  requirement?</button>

  <p>Answer TBA.</p>

      <h1>Questions about Particular Courses</h1>

<h3>Calculus I and II</h3>
      
<button class="accordion">When is Calculus offered?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Calculus I and II (a standard single-variable calculus
  sequences) are offered every other year. Calc I and II will be
  offered in 2024-25, 2026-27, 2028-29, etc. Please plan accordingly.</p> 
</div>

<button class="accordion">Am I ready for Calculus? What if I haven't
  taken Precalculus?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The most important thing for calculus readiness is that you've
  seen functions before and have worked with f(x) notation before and
  been reasonably comfortable with it at some point. If you've
  forgotten about logs and exponents and trigonometry, that's ok. We
    review topics as needed.</p>
  <p>You do not have to have taken a class called precalculus to be
  ready for calculus. As noted above, the most important pre-requisite
  is that you've worked with functions before.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Should I take Calculus?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Many students who are good at and/or like math feel they
    are "supposed to" take calculus.  The high school math curriculum is
    very centered on getting students to reach calculus, so calculus is
    seen as a goal or a pinnacle. (I don't think this is a great idea,
    but that's another conversation.) Perhaps your parents or siblings
    took calculus in college, or maybe you just feel it's next in
    line. For many, calculus is indeed an appropriate and fun
    course. Calculus is an incredibly powerful and flexible set of
    tools and ideas that are used through the mathematical sciences
    and which help to solidify and synthesize a great deal of
    mathematics. At the same time, you can live a rich, complete, and
    happy life without having taken calculus.</p>

  <p>Statistics is more important for many areas of study than
    calculus. And statistics is certainly used more  in other classes
    at COA than calculus.  So, don't feel like you "have to" take
    calculus.  Take it if you want to take it.</p> 

<p>That said, calculus is required by many graduate schools.
  So, if you're planning on going to grad school in the sciences or some
  of the social sciences, you'll probably need to take calculus at some
  point.<p>

  <p>Also, calculus is required for most of advanced math and
  physics classes offered at COA, including:  Differential Equations,
  Thermodynamics, Calculus III, and Linear Algebra.  If you think you
  might be interested in advanced physics or math, it's a good idea to
  take calculus sooner rather than later. And calculus is a great deal
  of fun.  It has many applications and it ties together a lot of
  different things that you learned in previous algebra classes.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Can I skip Calculus I and II?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Short answer: if you have taken a calculus class before and did
    reasonably well, you probably should skip Calc I and II. If you
    have taken AP Calculus (AB or BC) or done an HL maths in IB (AA or
    AI), then Calc I and II will be almost all review. If you've done
    SL maths, you can probably skip Calc I and II, but we should
    talk. (I'm still getting familiar with the new IB maths
    courses.)<p> 

    <p>Calc I reviews functions, and then covers differentiation and
  its applications. Calc II covers integration, applications, and
      briefly treats infinite sums and series.</p>

    <p>If you are at all unsure about whether or not you have the
    background to skip Calc I and II, please reach out.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Are there math classes for students who have
  already taken Calc I and II?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes! Check out the FAQs for Differential Equations, Linear
  Algebra, Calculus III, and Thermodynamics.</p>
</div>

<h3>Physics I and II</h3>

<button class="accordion">When are Physics I and II offered?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Physics I and II are offered every other year. Physics I and II
  will be offered in 2025-26, 2027-2028, 2029-30, and so on. Please
  plan accordingly. </p>
</div>


<button class="accordion">I've taken Physics before. Should I take
  Physics I?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Physics I covers mechanics: kinematics, forces and Newton's laws,
  conservation of energy and momentum. If you've had a good physics
  class before, you probably don't want to 
    take Physics I -- it might not be challenging. On the other hand, 
you'll probably find that Physics I covers familiar topics in a
different and (hopefully) interesting way. So you might still
be interested in Physics I. If you've had AP or IB physics, you
  should definitely not take Physics I. If you had a non-AP physics
  class, you probably shouldn't take physics. If in doubt, reach out
  and we can chat.</p>

<p>Physics I is an excellent course for students who want to improve
their quantitative problem solving skills and review algebra. It is
taken by some students as their only QR course. It's a great way to
get lots of practice solving word problems. Physics I also serves as
a pre-calc course of sorts; if you're uncertain of your algebra 
and trigonometry, taking Physics I can be a good way to improve your
skills so you have an easier time with Calculus or other math
  adventures.</p> 
</div>

<button class="accordion">I heard Physics II is not a typical Physics
  II class. Is this true?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What's Physics II all about?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Physics II focuses on Einstein's theory of special relativity and
    some key ideas and phenomena from quantum mechanics.  We will
    cover topics that are not covered in AP or IB (SL or HL)
    physics. This course does not require any mathematics beyond
    algebra and functions.</p>

  <p>Here is the course description: What are relativity and quantum
  mechanics, and why were they viewed as revolutionary when they were
  formulated in the early 1900s? How and why does relativity and
  quantum mechanics compel us to discard commonsense ideas about the
  nature of the physical world that are part of classical mechanics?
  Why is there not agreement on how to interpret quantum mechanics,
  and why does quantum mechanics even need interpretation? This
  version of Physics II covers Einstein's theory of special relativity
  and selected topics in quantum mechanics, and is designed to
  introduce students to some of the formalism and central results of
  relativity and quantum mechanics, so that they can formulate
  scientifically grounded answers to the above questions. Throughout
  the course we will start with first principles and carefully build
  toward key results, allowing students to see how relativity and
  quantum mechanicsâ€”two of the pillars of modern physicsâ€”were
  constructed and how they cohere as mathematically consistent and
  experimentally verified theories. The first half of the course will
  cover relativity topics including the principle of relativity,
  spacetime intervals and proper time, coordinate transformations,
  time dilation and Lorentz contraction, and relativistic energy and
  momentum. The second half of the course will turn toward the
  foundations of quantum mechanics, including: spin-1/2 particles,
  wave-particle duality, and Bell's inequalities and the
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. If time permits, we may cover
  additional topics such as blackbody radiation, the photoelectric
  effect, Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, and quantum
  cryptography. To gain a sense of the scientific, social, and
  material context in which the theories of relativity and quantum
  mechanics were developed, we will read a number of papers and book
  chapters by historians and philosophers of science. This course is
  designed to appeal to a wide range of studentsâ€”both those whose
  interests lie outside of science as well as those who are drawn
  toward the sciences or mathematics. Students who take this course
  should be comfortable working with mathematical
  abstraction. Evaluation is based on weekly problem sets,
  participation in weekly discussion sections, and several short
  reflection assignments. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Do I need to have taken Physics I in order
  to take Physics II?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How much math is in Physics II?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Some. In the course description I wrote "Students who take this
  course should be comfortable working with mathematical
    abstraction." What does this mean? Good question. </p>
  
  <p>Relativity and quantum mechanics aren't intuitive, in that they
  are far outside of our everyday experience. So we don't have any
  experience or intuition about relativistic or quantum mechanical
  phenomena. So what we have to do is start with some first
  principles. For example, in relativity, we assume that the speed of
  light is the same to all observers, regardless of the observer's
  speed. Then from that starting point, we need to do some math (and
  geometry) to see where that idea leads us.</p> 

<p>In contrast, say, in regular mechanics, we have some intuition that
  can guide us. E.g., someone running faster has more energy than
  someone slow. Jumping off a tall tree is more dangerous than jumping
  off a short tree.</p> 

<p>I don't think the level of math in the class is hard, in that
  there's no advanced algebra, no calculus, etc. It's just that the
  math is used in a context that isn't relatable, and so takes on a
  more abstract flavor.</p> 

<p>In the past the class has been taken by students with a pretty wide
  range of math backgrounds and it's been ok. If Quantum and
  Relativity are topics you're excited about, then I'd encourage you
  to sign up.</p> 
</div>

<button class="accordion">I'm interested in the philosophical aspects
  of relativity and quantum mechanics. Is there a class for me?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. You should take Physics II.</p>
</div>


<h3>Physics and Math of Sustainable Energy</h3>

<button class="accordion">What's The Physics and Math of Sustainable
  Energy all about?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I'll write something here someday. For now, see the web page from
  the <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Energy.F23">2023
      edition of the course</a>.</p>
  <!--
<p>This is a demanding introductory course designed to help students
  learn to do mathematical calculations and understand enough basic
  physics so that they can participate effectively and responsibly in
  discussions of sustainable energy and efforts to reduce greenhouse
  gas emissions. You'll learn some physics and learn a bit about how
  various energy generating and consuming technologies work.  We also
  cover basic financial mathematics, a topic that students expect to
  find dull but usually end up really enjoying.  Taking this course is
  strongly recommended for students wishing to participate in
  project-based renewable energy courses. This course is also a good
  match for those interested in sustainable business, climate change
  politics, and farming and agricultural policy.  The class will be
  offered in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018.</p>  
-->
</div>



<h3>Introduction to Chaos and Fractals</h3>

<button class="accordion">What's the deal with Intro to Chaos and Fractals?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Intro to Chaos and Fractals is an introductory, algebra-based
  class. It is the most interdisciplinary and least traditional math
  class that I teach. It is taken by a very wide range of students and
  is often a particularly good choice for students interested in the
  humanities, arts, literature, education. In addition to problem
  sets, students participate in discussions of readings, complete one
  or two reflection assignments (which could be a paper, poetry,
  visual art, etc), and do a final project on a topic and in a medium
  of their choosing.  This class tends toward the abstract; we use
  math to explore the meanings of order, disorder, pattern,
  simplicity, and complexity. Here is web page for
  the <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.F23">Fall
  2023 Intro to Chaos and Fractals</a> class. </p> 
  <p>Answer.</p>
</div>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>I don't teach statistics. So for a more definitive take on stats at
COA, you should talk to one of the stats instructors. I also don't
teach data science. For more details on data science and other
programming classes, talk
  to <a href="https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/">Laurie Baker</a>.</p> 

<button class="accordion">What's the deal with introductory
  statistics?</button> 
<div class="panel">
  <p>Introductory statistics is taught yearly by either Susan Letcher
  or Sean Todd. The class covers some pretty standard topics: measures
  of central tendency, regression, t-tests, p-values, and so
  on. Students learn some of the basics of the R programming
  language. Introductory statistics meets the QR requirement. This is
  a general introduction to statistics and is appropriate all
  students, including both those interested in the natural or social
  sciences.</p> 
</div>

<button class="accordion">What's the deal with biostatistics?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This is a class taught roughly every other year by Susan
  Letcher. It covers statistical techniques commonly used in
  ecology. R programming is emphasized. Intro stats or the equivalent
  in a pre-req.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I had AP Statistics, can I skip the intro
  stats class?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I don't know. Best to talk to Sean or Susan.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is there more statistics?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. Sean Todd, John Anderson, and I have offered tutorials and
  independent studies on different aspects of intermediate
  statistics. Susan Letcher facilitates independent studies on
  biodiversity statistics and robust experimental design for
  ecological field sampling. Talk to one of us if you think you might
  be interested. Also, John's Wildlife Ecology class includes a fair
  amount of statistics and meets the QR requirement.</p> 
</div>

<h3>Some Intermediate-Level Math Classes</h3>

<p>Note: The classes Linear Algebra, Calculus III, Differential
Equations, and Thermodynamics can be taken in any order</p>

<button class="accordion">What's Calc III? Do I have sufficient
  background to take it?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Calculus III is calculus applied to functions of two and three
  variables --- surfaces and volumes.  We also briefly survey the
  calculus of vector fields in the last few weeks of the course.  Most
  students find Calc III to be more interesting and somewhat less
  challenging than Calc I and II.  To take this class you should have
  had integral and differential calculus.  AP Calculus at the AB or BC
  level, or IB math HL or (probably) SL, will prepare you for this
  class, as would Calculus I and II here or at another college.  If
  you feel you  have forgotten a lot of Calculus, that's ok. Calc III
  reviews Calc I and II topics along the way, so this is a great
  course to solidify basic calculus knowledge. I typically offer this
  course only once every 3-4 years.  Here is
  the <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Calc.3.W22">course
  website</a> from the last 
  time I taught Calc III.</p> 
</div>

<button class="accordion">What's Linear Algebra?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Although often viewed as a post-calculus class, Linear Algebra is
  not a continuation of calculus, and prior coursework in calculus is
  not a pre-requisite.<p> 
  <p>Linear algebra is an area of mathematics concerned with the
    generic algebra of linear systems and vector spaces. Linear
    Algebra is one of the cornerstones of applied and pure
    mathematics. It is used across the quantitative sciences,
    including in economics, multivariable statistics, machine
    learning, physics, and many ecological and epidemiological
    models.</p> 
  <p>In the spring 2024 course we will use free, online, interactive
    textbook <a href="https://understandinglinearalgebra.org/ula.html">Understanding
    Linear Algebra</a>, by David Austin. I hope to cover most of the
    topics in the first four chapters.</p>  
  <p> The spring 2024 course will be similar to the <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Linear_Algebra.13/">2013 edition of
      Linear Algebra</a>.</p>
  <p>I teach Linear Algebra roughly once every four years.
  <p>Linear Algebra will feel very much a math class: we will be
  learning mathematical constructions and techniques using mostly 
  pencil and paper. But it will feel very different than calculus and
  pre-calculus. <p>
  <p>Official Course Description: Linear algebra is a foundational
  area of mathematics, finding widespread application in statistics,
  machine learning, economics, physics, and across the sciences. The
  starting point for this course is to consider basic properties of
  matrices and techniques for solving systems of linear
  equations. Abstracting and formalizing the process of solving linear
  equations leads us to the notion of a vector space and related
  ideas, such as linear independence, dimension, and basis. The course
  then turns to further properties of matrices and vector spaces,
  including determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and linear
  transformations. As time permits, we will study various applications
  of linear algebra, such as image compression, dynamical systems
  (with a focus on ecological applications), Markov chains, and
  Google's PageRank algorithm. Students who successfully complete this
  course will gain a solid introduction to the calculational
  techniques and key constructions and ideas of linear algebra that
  will prepare them for further work in the sciences and
  mathematics. Additionally, students will gain experience working at
  a level of generality and abstraction above that encountered in a
  typical introductory calculus sequence. Evaluation will be based on
  weekly problem sets. Students who enroll in this course should have
  successfully completed a high-school-level algebra class and be
  motivated to explore a powerful and broadly-used branch of
  mathematics that for most has a very different feel than the
  functions-precalculus-calculus sequence. Calculus is not a
  prerequisite for this class. Level:
  Introductory/Intermediate. Prerequisites: A high school-level
  algebra class. Class limit: None. Lab fee: None. Meets the following

<button class="accordion">Does COA have a math center? What if I need help?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>COA does not have a math skills center as such. But all math classes
  (except for a few advanced courses) have multiple peer teaching
  assistants (TAs). These students hold open sessions to provide help
  on the weekly homework assignments. In a typical class there will be
  around six hours of scheduled help sessions weekly -- this includes both
  the TAs and me. If the scheduled times don't work, you can find an
  alternative time with me or one of the TAs.</p>

<button class="accordion">I've struggled with math, and/or it's seemed

<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. Answer TBA.</p>

<button class="accordion">What math is needed for graduate school?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>It depends on the graduate school. Answer TBA.</p>
  <!--
<p>This depends, of course, on what sort of graduate
school you're interested in.  I believe that almost all science grad
schools as well as medical and veterinary schools require two terms of
calculus. These programs also usually require at least two terms of
  physics. 
Some social science/economics programs probably also require some
calculus and also a term or two of statistics.  For a more definitive
answer, you should consult the grad school(s) you're interested in.
Most graduate programs list admissions requirements on their
website.  The requirements for admission into graduate programs often
  have a little flexibility.  There is much less flexibility in the
  requirements for medical or veterinary school.
 Depending on the sort of economics program you're interested
in, you may also need some additional advanced classes, such as
Calculus III, Linear Algebra, or computer programming.  If you're
considering physics, engineering, or mathematics, you'll needs
quite a bit of math.  We should talk.</p>

<p>In many fields having additional math courses beyond what is
required can strengthen your application to graduate school.  More
importantly, you can apply math or programming skills to the research
questions you're interested in.</p>

<p>That said, "because I need it for graduate school" is probably not
  a good reason to take a math class during your first year.  Don't
  worry about grad school requirements now.  Take challenging and
  inspiring and fun classes and worry about grad school later. </p>
