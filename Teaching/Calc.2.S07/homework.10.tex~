\begin{enumerate}

\item Calculate the following integrals.  Use Maple to check your work
  if you want, but you should do these integrals by hand.

\begin{equation}
  \int 3x^4 \, dx 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \int_0^1 2x \cos(x^2) \, dx 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \int_2^4 x e^{-3x} \, dx 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \int x^3 \ln x \, dx \;
\end{equation}


\item The number of email messages per day received by an
  academic administrator is well approximated by a Gaussian
  distribution with mean $80$ and standard deviation $20$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write down the probability density function $p(x)$.

\item Determine the probability that the administrator receives
  between $90$ and $110$ email messages.  Do this two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Have Maple evaluate a definite integral.
  \item Approximate the definite integral by hand.  Form both left and
  right hand sums.  Use a $\Delta x$ of $10$. 
\end{enumerate}

\item What is the probability that between $60$ and $100$ messages are
  received? 

\item What is the probability that more than $150$ messages are
  received? 

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item One more problem.

\item And one more problem still.  But that'll be it.


\end{enumerate}
