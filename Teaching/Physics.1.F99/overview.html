<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
As our primary text we will use the <a
href="http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas">Six Ideas</a> 
books by <a href="http://pages.pomona.edu/~tmoore/">Tom
Moore</a>.  I would like to cover all of unit C and about half of unit N.
<p>

I have two main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to learn several big physics ideas:  Conservation of
energy, momentum, and angular momentum; and Newton's Laws.  
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/ADMISSIONS/Registrar/CourseCatalog/AcademicPlanning/records.html">page 8</a>
of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br>

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at 5pm.  More than one unexcused late
homework assignment will result in me mentioning this in your
narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your grade.  
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
You may not, however, get any help from any humans during the exam.
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading, and come prepared with some questions or areas that
you want to discuss.
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
no higher than a C.  
<li>I expect you to attend class and labs.  
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
</ol>
