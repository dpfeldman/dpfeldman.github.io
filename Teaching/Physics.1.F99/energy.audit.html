<h1 align=center> Energy Audit</h1><p>
<p>
<br>



<b> Note:  You must get your plans for the energy audit you wish to
conduct approved by me before you go ahead and do this
project!!!</b><p><br> 

Use the Watt meter that we have and do an energy audit of some stuff
in your home or one campus.  Figure out how much energy different
things use.  Express your answers in Joules and kilowatt-hours and
dollars.  <p>

Here are some ideas for things to investigate.


<ul>
<li>  <b>Toasters:</b>  See how much energy the toaster in the dining hall
uses.  Compare and contrast traditional toasters with toaster ovens. <p>

<li>  <b>Photocopy Machines:</b> Figure out how much energy the
photocopy machine uses.  How much more energy does it use when
photocopying?  How much energy does it use when warming up?<p>

<li>  <b>Light bulbs:</b>  Figure out how much energy different light
bulbs use.  Using a Lux meter (a device that measures brightness)
determine the efficiency of different bulbs.<p>

<li> <b>Computers:</b>  Does your computer use more energy when it's
"thinking" or when it's not doing anything?  How much energy does it
take to print a page of text?<p>

<li> <b>Vending Machines:</b> How much energy does the soda machine
outside the computer lab use?


</ul>
<p><br>
<b> Other stuff to ponder</b>

<ul>
<li> Find some references that discuss under what circumstances it's
best to leave lights on instead of turning them off.  Summarize what
you find.
</ul>
