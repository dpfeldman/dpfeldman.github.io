<h3>Rolling Stuff Again</h3>

Consider a disk and a hoop with identical mass M and identical
radius R.  Suppose the objects are released from rest and allowed to
roll down an incline.  The incline has length $L$ and one end is
raised to a height of $h$.
<ol>
<li> Determine an expression for the velocity of the hoop at the
bottom of the incline.  
<li> Determine a similar expression for the velocity of the disk.
<li> Calculate the ratio of the two velocities.
<li> Make measurements of the velocities of the hoop and the disk at
the bottom of the incline.  (Take several measurements and average
your results.)
<li> Does your experimental velocity ratio agree with the theoretical
velocity ratio? <p><br>
</ol>

<h3>Inelastic collisions</h3>

Consider the "Newton Knocker" apparatus with three of the balls moved
to the side, leaving two balls that can collide with each other.
<ol>
<li>
Release one ball from a height h_1.  If the moving ball sticks to the
other ball, use conservation of energy to predict how high will the
two balls will go.
<li> Try the experiment, using a small piece of duct tape to make the
balls stick together.  Does the theory agree with experiment?
</ol>
