<h2 align=center>Lab 3: Two-Dimensional Momentum, Estimation, and
Dimensional Analysis</h2><p>

<br><br>

<h3>Two-Dimensional Momentum Conservation</h3><p>

Consider the multiflash photograph of a collision of two billiard
balls.  Assume that the time interval between flashes is .1 second.  
Do the measurements below reasonably carefully.  

<ol>
<li> Choose a coordinate system.  (A clever choice will make the
problem a little easier.)

<li> Determine the velocity vectors for each of the balls before and
after the collision.  Write the vector as both a magnitude and
direction in component form.

<li>  Determine the momentum of the system before and after the
collision.  Write your answer as both a magnitude and direction and in
component form.  

<li>  Is momentum conserved?  

</ol>

<h3>Dimensional Analysis </h3>
From P. Tipler, <i> Physics for Scientists and Engineers</i>, Third
edition, Worth Publishers, 1991.

<ol>
<li> The period T of a simple pendulum depends on the length L of
the pendulum and the strength of earth's gravitational field g.
Find a simple combination of L and g that has the dimensions of
time.  

<li> Check the dependence of the period T on the length L by
measuring the period for three different values ofL.  (The period
T is defined as the time for a complete to-and-fro swing.)

<li> The correct formula involves a numerical factor that is
dimensionless and hence can't be obtained by dimensional analysis.
Using your data from the above question, estimate the value of the
numerical factor.

<h3>Estimation:  Potatoes</h3>
<ol>

<li> You are visiting a local organic potato farm and are discussing the
     possibility of buying the farmer's potatoes to use in the COA
     dining hall. The farmer is very interested and asks you
     approximately  how many pounds of potatoes COA would need each
     month. Come up with an order of magnitude estimate of the pounds
     of potatoes used in the dining hall each month.  Do this problem
     without a calculator.

<li> How many acres of land would be needed to grow these potatoes?
     Consult the seed catalog.  Apparently in Maine soil it is
     possible to get around 20 lbs of potatoes from one pound of
     seed.  

<li> How much would the seed cost?  What is the approximate value of
     the crop?

<li> How many acres of land would be needed to feed the entire
     population of the United States for one year?  Assume that we all
     eat nothing but potatoes.

<li> How many acres would be needed to feed the world potatoes?
