<ol>

<li> Read the Article, ``Reinventing the Wheel'' by Will Hively in
<i>Discover</i>, vol. 17, no.8.  This article is on reserve in the
library and is also available online.  Go to <a
href="http://discover.com/archive/index.html">their website</a> and
search for articles written by Hively.  

<li> What is radius of the disks discussed in the fourth paragraph of
Hively's article?  (Calculate the radius using the revs per minute and
the speed on the edge of the disk given in the article.)


<li> Calculate how much energy can be stored by this 50 pound
disk.  State your answer in both Joules and kilowatt-hours.  

<li> How much would it cost in Maine to spin up this flywheel?
Assume that electricity can be converted to flywheel energy at 96%
efficiency.  

<li> Estimate how far a car powered by 16 such flywheels could go
between recharges.  (Hint:  See problem C11R.2.)



<li> Estimate how much energy is stored by the flywheels in use in
the pottery studio.  (If you have questions about their specification,
ask Ernie---he made them.)  Your write-up should state how you arrived
at this estimate.

<b>Bonus Question/Other Stuff to Think About</b>
<ul>

<li>  Take a look at the technical report by Trinity Flywheel Power
on reserve in the library.  In the first equation, what are the
dimensions of sigma_k the <i> hoop stress</i>?  Do these units make
sense?  How do you think hoop stress is defined?

<li> Find some more recent information on flywheels.  Has Bitterly
successfully tested his car?
