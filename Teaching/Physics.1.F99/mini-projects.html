<h1 align=center> Physics I Mini-Projects</h1><p>
<p>
<br>



Work in groups of two or three.  You should hand in only one write-up
per group.   Your reasoning should be clear, but I'm not looking for
elegant essays.  Be sure to cite any sources you consult, including web
sites.  This assignment will count as a 75 point homework.  Each
group member will receive the same grade/evaluation. <p>

<b>Completed projects are due Friday 5 November.</b><p>

Here are the three mini-projects for you to choose from.

<h3><li><a href="flywheel.html">Flywheel Power</a></h3>
<h3><li><a href="energy.audit.html">Energy Audit</a></h3>
