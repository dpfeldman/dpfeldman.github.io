<h3>What is Linear Algebra?</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
Wikipedia's entry
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear
    algebra</a> has a good summary:

<blockquote>
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of
vectors, with families of vectors called vector spaces or linear
spaces, and with functions that input one vector and output another,
according to certain rules. These functions are called linear maps (or
linear transformations or linear operators) and are often represented
by matrices. Linear algebra is central to modern mathematics and its
applications. An elementary application of linear algebra is to the
solution of a system of linear equations in several unknowns. More
advanced applications are ubiquitous... . 
<!--, in areas as diverse as abstract
algebra and functional analysis. ... 
Linear algebra has a concrete
representation in analytic geometry and is generalized in operator
theory and in module theory.-->
 It has extensive applications in
engineering, physics, natural sciences and the social
sciences. [Linear algebra is also important to study because]
nonlinear mathematical models can often be approximated by 
linear ones.

<h3>The Roles of Linear Algebra</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">There are considerable differences among
  linear algebra courses and textbooks.  Roughly speaking, there are
  three not mutually exclusive roles that linear algebra plays in the
  math curriculum:
<ol>
  <li>Linear algebra teaches a set of techniques for solving
  problems.  These classes often emphasize applications.  
  <li>Linear algebra serves as a bridge toward more advanced or
  abstract mathematics.
  <li>Linear algebra can be an entry point for numerical mathematics.
  This includes:
<ul> 
    <li>Using a computer to do mathematics and solve problems. 
    <li>Analyzing the run-time and convergence properties of
    algorithms, writing original code. 
</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="no-box">
This course will combine elements of 1, 2, and the first item of 3.
    I'm not certain of the exact balance; this will depend on the
    interests of the class.  
</p>



<h3>Informal Description</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
Here is some additional information and advice that should give you a
better idea what to expect from this class, how to enjoy it and do
well, and help you decide whether or not this class is for you.  
</b>

<ul>

<li> Linear algebra is standard topic in the college mathematics
   curricula. It is usually taken by students in their sophomore
   year. Linear Algebra is required for math, physics, engineering,
   statistics, and economics majors. I suspect it's required for
   chemistry majors, but I'm not sure. In general, anyone who works in
   a mathematical field will need to know linear algebra. <br><br>

<li> My experience as a student was that linear algebra seemed very
   easy. So I didn't do much work in the class. But then it got harder
   quite quickly and I was lost and in a lot of trouble. As always,
   it's important to stay caught up, because you can get left behind
   pretty quickly in a course like this. <br><br>

<li> Also, when I took linear algebra I remember thinking that the
   material was kinda silly and that I would never use it. However, I
   ended up using linear algebra in almost every math and physics
   class I took, and I use it in my research all the time---much more
   than I use calculus. Some of the applications of linear algebra
   might not be apparent immediately, but please believe me when I say
   that it is a very useful topic to know. <br><br>

<!--
<li> Technically, this class is a tutorial. In practical terms, what
   this means for you is that a little more of the work burden falls
   on you than would be the case for a class. In particular, I will
   not have time to give detailed comments on all of your homework
   assignments. Instead, I will frequently ask you to check your work
   using the solutions manual. In most cases, though, I suspect that
   won't be necessary; you should work the problem until you know you
   have the right answer. And at this point in your mathematical
   careers, you are a pretty good judge of when you have the right
   answer or not. 
-->

<li> This class will move at a fairly brisk pace. I suspect that there
   will be times when you will need to read a chapter on your own and
   then ask questions during class if you have any. I think our
   textbook is pretty good, so learning a few things on your own won't
   be a problem. (It's also good practice for learning independently.)
   If we can do this, we'll be able to cover more topics, and I'll
   also be able to spend time presenting interesting applications of
   the material. <br><br>

<li>This class does not rely on a knowledge of calculus.
  Nevertheless, Calc I and II are pre-requisites, as a certain level
  of comfort with mathematics and abstraction is important background
  for this course.<br><br>

<li>Introductory linear algebra is at times an odd mixture of tedious
  and straightforward calculations and austere and potentially difficult
  abstractions.  <br><br>

<li> This is the third time I've taught this class, and this is the
   first time using this text. So I'm not 100% certain how much we'll
   be able to cover. Your honest feedback on the pace and level of
   difficulty will be important.
