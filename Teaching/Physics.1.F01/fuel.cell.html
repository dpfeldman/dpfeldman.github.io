You main task is to get the hydrogen fuel cell kit to work.  There's 
an instruction booklet that you should follow.  You'll need to set up
a time with me to get the fuel kit.<p>

Your write-up need not be extensive, but it should contain a sketch of
the apparatus and a brief discussion of how it works.  You should also
make a few measurements.  How much gas did you get, and how long did
it take to make?  How long did the fan run using this gas?<p>

If you have time and are so inclined, use the volt meters to measure
the voltage and current produced by the solar cell, and the voltage
and current produced by the fuel cell that goes into the fan.<p>
