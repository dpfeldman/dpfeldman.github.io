<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
As our primary text we will use the <a
href="http://www.physics.pomona.edu/sixideas">Six Ideas</a> 
books by <a href=
"http://www.physics.pomona.edu/faculty/prof/tmoore/index.html">Tom 
Moore</a>.  I would like to cover all of unit C and about a third of
unit N. 
<p>

I have several main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want you to learn several big physics ideas:  conservation of
energy, momentum, and angular momentum; and Newton's Laws.  

<li>I want you to gain experience working effectively in groups.
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based roughly on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

I recommend against grades; I believe they are more likely than not to
interfere with genuine, reflective learning.  However, I will assign
grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines in the COA
Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br> 

<h3>Policies, Advice, and Stuff:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning this
in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your grade.  
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
      confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
      sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can
      offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know
      who needs it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help
      if you need it. On a related note ... 

<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
      don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
      first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated -- I strongly
      suggest working with others and seeking help if you need it.

<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
You may not, however, get any help from any humans during the exam.
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading, and come prepared with some written questions or areas
that you want to discuss.  More info about class preparation can be
found <a href="preparation.html">here</a>. 
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
no higher than a C.  
<li>I expect you to attend class and labs.  
<li>I will be sending out class info via email.  Thus, it's important
that you check your email.
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty winter term, 1999.
</ol>
