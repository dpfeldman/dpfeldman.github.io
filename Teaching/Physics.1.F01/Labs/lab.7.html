<b>Angular Momentum</b>

<ol>
<li>Do the following experiments.  (Each person in your group should
do at least one of these.  If no other groups are waiting for the
rotating platform, everyone should try each.)
<ol>
  <li> Stand on the ground.  Spin of the bicycle wheel and hold it
  horizontally.  Then get on the platform.  Turn the bicycle wheel
  upside down. 
  <li> Stand on the platform and hold the wheel.  (The wheel shouldn't
  be spinning yet.)  Then, hold the wheel horizontally and give it a
  spin. 
  <li>  Hold the two heavy weights and stand on the platform.  Have
  someone give you a gentle spin.  Move the weights in and out.
  <li>  Stand on the platform and hold something heavy and
  unbreakable. 
  <ol>
    <li>Throw the heavy thing in such a manner that you end up
    rotating after the throw.
    <li>Throw the heavy thing equally hard, but now throw it so that
    you don't rotate after the throw.
  </ol>
</ol>

<li>  Explain all of these phenomena using conservation of angular
momentum.  Before moving on to the next exercise, share your
explanations with me.

<b>More Angular Momentum</b><p>

<ol>
<li>  Consider a soda can hung by a thread.  If a hole is put in the
bottom of the can, the liquid will rush out of the can.  Depending on
the nature of the hole, three things may happen:
<ol>
  <li> The can will spin clockwise as the fluid leaves it.
  <li> The can will spin counterclockwise as the fluid leaves it.
  <li> The can won't spin at all.
</ol>
<li>Experiment with different types of holes until you get a can that
will spin and a can that won't spin.
<li> Use angular momentum to explain the behavior of your cans.
Before going on to the next activity, share your explanations with me.
</ol>
<p><br>

<b>Motion Diagrams</b>
<ol>
<li>A bicycle moves at a constant velocity of 2m/s.   
<ol>
  <li>Make a motion diagram for the bike.
  <li>Make a careful of the bicycle's position, velocity, and
  acceleration vs. time. 
</ol>

<li> Ticker timer:
<ol>
<li>Make a motion diagram for something falling using the ticker
timer.  
<li>Draw the velocity and acceleration arrows.  Do this for around 5
dots.   
<li>Then make a plot of the position, velocity, and
acceleration vs. time.  (Use a different set of axes for each plot.) 
</ol>
</ol>
