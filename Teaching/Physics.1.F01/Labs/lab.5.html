<h3>Rolling Stuff Again</h3>

Consider a disk and a hoop with identical mass M and identical
radius R.  Suppose the objects are released from rest and allowed to
roll down an incline.  The incline has length L and one end is
raised to a height of h.
<ol>
<li> Determine an expression for the velocity of the hoop at the
bottom of the incline.  
<li> Determine a similar expression for the velocity of the disk.
<li> Calculate the ratio of the two velocities.
<li> Make measurements of the velocities of the hoop and the disk at
the bottom of the incline.  (Take several measurements and average
your results.)
<li> Does your experimental velocity ratio agree with the theoretical
velocity ratio? <p><br>
</ol>

<h3>Inelastic collisions</h3>

Consider the "Newton Knocker" apparatus with three of the balls moved
to the side, leaving two balls that can collide with each other.
<ol>
<li>
Release one ball from a height h_1.  If the moving ball sticks to the
other ball, use conservation of energy to predict how high will the
two balls will go.
<li> Try the experiment, using a small piece of duct tape to make the
balls stick together.  Does the theory agree with experiment?
</ol>

<h3>Specific Heat</h3>
</center> 

<ol>
<li>Suppose you place a hot piece of metal in a styrofoam cup
containing some water. By how much will the temperature of the water
increase?  Try this out with one of the known pieces of metal.  Then
calculate the expected temperature rise as done in example 10.3 on
page 145.
