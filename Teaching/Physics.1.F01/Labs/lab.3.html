<b>Two-Dimensional Momentum Conservation</b><p>
 
Consider the multiflash photograph of a collision of two billiard
balls.  Assume that the time interval between flashes is .1 second.
Do the measurements below reasonably carefully.
 
<ol>
<li> Choose a coordinate system.  (A clever choice will make the
problem a little easier.)
 
<li> Determine the velocity vectors for each of the balls before and
after the collision.  Write the vector as both a magnitude and
direction and in component form.
 
<li>  Determine the momentum of the system before and after the
collision.  Write your answer as both a magnitude and direction and in
component form.
 
<li>  Is momentum conserved?
 
</ol>

<b>Library Books</b><p>

In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California, approximately 2
         million books fell off the shelves at the 
         Stanford University library. If you were the library
         administrator and wanted to hire enough part-time 
         student labor to put the books back on the shelves in
         order in 2 weeks, how many students would you have 
         to hire? (You may assume that the books just fell off the
         shelves and got a bit mixed up but books in 
         different aisles did NOT get shuffled together.) From <a

<b>Roller Coasters</b>

<ol>
<li>Take a look at the roller coaster apparatus.  Answer the following
questions <i>before</i> you start experimenting.  Discuss as a group,
and be sure to write down your hypotheses.
<ol>
<li>At the end of which track will the ball be moving the fastest?
Why?

<li> If a race were held, the ball in which track would get to the
bottom the first?  Why?

</ol>
<li>Now experiment and see if your hypotheses were correct.  Discuss.
