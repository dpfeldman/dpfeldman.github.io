<br>


Work in groups of three or so.  You should hand in only one write-up
per group.   Your reasoning should be clear, but I'm not looking for
elegant essays.  But complete sentences and clearly stated results
would be good.  Be sure to cite any sources you consult, including web 
sites.  This assignment "counts" roughly a half or a third of a HW
assignment.  Each group member will receive the same
grade/evaluation. <p>  


Here are some mini-projects for you to choose from.
