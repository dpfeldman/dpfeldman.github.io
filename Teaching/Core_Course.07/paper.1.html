<b>This paper will be due Tuesday 18 September, 2007.</b><p>

	Response papers for this class give you the opportunity to
	capture your ideas and go beneath the surface by asking you to
	write about what you read.  While they should be typed and
	coherent (and spell-checked), response papers do not need to
	be as structured as formal essays.  I'm interested in your
	analytic skills:  your modes of working with what you sense
	and see, what you think, what you are asking yourself, what
	you are noticing or being bothered by.  I want you to explore
	that on paper and experience your writing as
	thinking. <p>

 <!--Response papers are always due at the start of class
	%Gâ€”%@ they are a way for you to really ’¡Èown’¡É the
	material you are reading.  Late response papers will not be
	accepted. -->
 
	In approaching the response paper, plan to sit down at your
	computer or journal and address something you can really
	develop passion and concern about.  Choose a question, word,
	phrase, issue, passage, or idea from the reading and really
	dig deeply.  Read carefully, mark your text up, think about
	what the words are truly saying, and use this as a starting
	point for demonstrating your thinking.  
        <!--Response papers should
	be a maximum of one single-spaced typed paged (but you can
	double-space if that is easier and go for two pages).-->
        They
	should not be essays; they should reflect both deep analytic
	thought and intellectual risk-taking.  Find something that
	really interests you to explore.  Push the idea as far as you
	can and push yourself. Make a discovery and ensure that your
	reader will not be bored by what you see and say. Defend your
	perspective.  Above all, the response paper should be
	intellectually and emotionally satisfying.  <p><br>

Here are some additional guidelines for the paper.

<ul>
<li>The paper can be about any aspect of the Great Gatsby.  Choose
something that's interesting to you.
<li>You will rewrite/rethink this paper at least once.  So don't
worry; what matters is the final product and how you 
develop your ideas as you get there. 
<li>Response papers should be two or, at most, three pages in length.
<li>The audience you should probably have in mind while writing is:
you, me, and the rest of the people in the class.  Assume that your
audience has read Gatsby.
<li>I strongly recommend writing in the first person.  But you don't
have to. 
<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed.  
<!--<li>Your writing should be clear; use "correct" usage.  Grammar and
overall clarity factor into your evaluation.  The writing can be
quite informal, but should still read ok.-->
<!--<li>Please hand in your papers on time. If you don't hand in your
paper on time, it'll take me longer to get you feedback so you can
revise your paper.  If you need extra time or something comes up, let
me know.-->
