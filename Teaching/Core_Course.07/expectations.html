<!--This class is quite likely very different than other classes you
may have taken.  Given this, it's important to know what to expect, so
you know what you're getting in to. -->


<ul>

<li>I've taught this class twice before.  Both times it went well, but
the classes were very different.  So I'm not certain exactly how this
class will go.  
I am certain that I'm very excited to teach it and that I
have a lot of ideas that I want to try out.  I'm very confident it
will go well, but I can't predict exactly how.<p>

<li>More than most classes, the success of this course, for you and
your classmates, depends on you.  This class will only be effective if
you put time and thought into it, participate actively, and if we all
work together to make connections and answer questions.<p>

<li>Thus, we all <i>share</i> responsibility for:
<ul>
  <li>Coming to class prepared. <!--This means you should do the reading
  and be ready to begin the discussion by contributing questions or
  comments.-->
  <li>Being mindful of group dynamics and respecting other's views and
  intellect.  
  <li>Bringing energy, alertness, and curiosity to our time of shared
  work. 
</ul>
<p>
<li>This class is a beginning, not an end.  I hope that you'll leave
the class with more questions than you entered.  I hope this class
helps to transform the nature of the questions you ask, rather than
providing all the answers.<p>

<li>Although I'm unsure of a few of the particular steps, I do have a
definite, albeit flexible, plan for this class.  There will be times
when things may seem a little disconnected.  You may find yourself
asking, "what does A have to do with B", and by all means give voice
to these questions.  I do think there's a "big picture" or a
semi-coherent whole to the different things I want to do, but it might
not always be apparent until we're closer to the end of the ten
weeks.<p> 

<li>From time to time we'll do some role playing exercises and other
group activities.  Sometimes the reason for doing them won't be clear
until the activities is over.  I will never set you up for failure or
ridicule or anything like that.  And you can always opt out at any
time.  <p>

<li>In the final two-thirds of this class there will be many, many
handouts.  You may wish to buy a binder, or figure out some other way
to keep everything organized.<p>

<li>We'll be doing a lot of different things in this class.  Some of
them you'll like more than others.<p>

<li>At times, this class will be a lot of work.  It's thus important
that you start readings and assignments early.<p>

<li>  If you're having trouble or are confused about something, it's
very important that you seek help sooner rather than later.  You need
to take responsibility to seek help if you need it. <p> 

<li> The exact syllabus for this class is quite flexible; feedback is
encouraged, and will help make the class better.  <p>
