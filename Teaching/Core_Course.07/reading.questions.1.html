<h3 align=center>reading questions for <i>Gatsby</i>, chapters I-V</h3>

<br>

 Come to class with two written questions on the reading:
<ol>
   <li> A big question, as big as you can think of. Something thematic
   or large. 
   <li> A "little" question. Focus on the text. Why did Fitzgerald use
   a certain word? Or why does he bother to tell us a certain detail?  
</ol>

We will use these questions to help get discussion started in class.
