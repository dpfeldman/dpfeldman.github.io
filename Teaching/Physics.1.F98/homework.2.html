<b>Homework 2:  Due Friday September 25 at 5PM  </b><p>


  <dd> Fermi Problem:<ul>
          <li>You are visiting a local organic potato farm and are
          discussing the possibility of buying the farmer's potatoes
          to use in the COA dining hall.  The farmer is very
          interested and asks you approximately how many pounds of
          potatoes COA would need each month.  Come up with an order
          of magnitude estimate of the pounds of potatoes used in the
          dining hall each month.  (10 points.  To get full credit you
          do not need to come close to the actual number.  I'm mainly
          interested in seeing a clear explanation of your logic.  Try
          to do this problem without a calculator -- what sort of nerd
          would bring a calculator with them when visiting a farm?) 
  </ul><p>

	    calculus or if you want a challenge.
