<b>Homework 4:  Due Friday October 9 at 5PM  </b><p>


Chapter 7:
<ol>
	    <li>C7B.4  (5 points)
	    <li>C7B.5  (5 points)
	    <li>C7S.1  (10 points)
	    <li>C7S.9 (10 points)
	    <li>C7R.2 (10 points)
	    <li>C7A.1 and C7A.2 are both great calculus problems.  If you're a
	    calculus type, give these a try in your copious spare
	    time.  They're not easy.  See me if you want to work
	    through them together.  (bonus)
