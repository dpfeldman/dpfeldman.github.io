<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
As our primary text we will use the <a
href="http://pages.pomona.edu/~tmoore/sixideas.html">Six Ideas</a> 
books by <a href="http://pages.pomona.edu/~tmoore/">Tom
Moore</a>.  I would like to cover all of unit C and most of unit N.
I also anticipate spending about week on "chaos."<p>

I have two main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to learn several big physics ideas:  Conservation of
energy, momentum, and angular momentum; and Newton's Laws.  
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/ADMISSIONS/Registrar/CourseCatalog/AcademicPlanning/records.html">page 8</a>
of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br>

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at 5pm.  I will only accept one
    unexcused late assignment. 
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
<li>For each class for which I assign reading, you should arrive
    with one question and one comment on the reading.  I will often
    use your comments and questions as a starting point for class
    discussion. 
</ol>
