</ol>

Chapter N5:
<ol>
      <li>An object accelerates at 10 m/s^2.  Make the following plots
      on graph paper.  Be sure to label your axes correctly.  Do not
      use the equations on pages 63 or 65.
      <ol>
      <li>Graph the object's acceleration as a function of time. (5 points)
      <li>Graph the object's velocity as a function of time.  (5 points)
      <li>Graph the object's position as a function of time.  (5 points)
      <li>Using your graph, determine how long it would take for a
      rock dropped from a height of 10 meters to reach the ground.  (5 points)
      (Ignore air resistance.) 
      <li>Using your graph, determine the rock's velocity immediately
      before it hits the ground.  (5 points)
      (Ignore air resistance.)
      </ol>
