Level: Intermediate<br>
Prerequisites: Calculus III.  Differential Equations strongly
recommended.  Permission of instructor.  <br>
Requirements met: <i>Quantitative Reasoning</i><br>


<p>The first half of this tutorial will consist of a rapid tour of the
key elements of linear algebra.  We will cover vector and matrix
algebra, linear vector spaces and subspaces, basis and dimension, the
determinant, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  We will then consider
first-order linear differential equations---first scalar equations and
then systems of equations.  We will see that linear algebra is an
indispensable tool for solving systems of linear differential
equations and understanding the geometric structure of their solutions.
In addition to covering basic theory, we will consider a handful of
case studies that illustrate the power of the mathematical techniques
we are learning.  These case studies will be drawn from across the
sciences.  The particular case studies we examine will depend on
student interests.</p>

<p>Students who successfully complete this course will gain a solid
introduction to the calculational techniques and key constructions and
ideas of linear algebra.  Students will also learn techniques for
solving and understanding systems of linear differential equations.
Additionally, this course serves as an introduction to formal
mathematics; students will learn to work at a level of generality and
abstraction a bit above that encountered in a typical introductory
calculus sequence.</p>

<p>Students will be required to read sections of the text in advance
  of each class.  Class sessions will be devoted primarily to
  discussion and problem solving.  Evaluation will be based on class
  participation and weekly problem sets.  This is a fast-paced
  tutorial for students with a strong preparation in mathematics.
  Pre-requisites: Calculus III.  Differential Equations strongly
  recommended. </p>

Our textbook for the course will
be <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/ot145/">Ordinary Differential
  Equations and Linear Algebra: A Systems Approach</a>
by <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/~tmk5/">Todd Kapitula</a>  We will
cover chapters 1, 2, and 3.

<p> The first half of the course will cover basic linear algebra,
including:
<ul>
  <li>Solving linear systems of equations via row reduction
  <li>Matrix algebra: additional and multiplication
  <li>The inverse of a matrix
  <li>Linear combinations and linear subspaces
  <li>Bases and dimension
  <li>Determinants
  <li>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
</ul></p>

<p>This will be followed by a treatment of linear first-order
  differential equations, including:
<ul>
  <li>Particular and general solutions
  <li>Method of undetermined coefficients
  <li>Integrating factors
</ul>

<p>In the last part of the course we will consider systems of coupled
  linear differential equations.  To do so, we will write systems in
  matrix form and show how the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the
  resulting matrix can be used to form general solutions. <p><br>

<p>For most classes students will be assigned a few problems to
  discuss and/or present.  There will also be several short cases
  studies applying course content that will be written up and handed
  in.</p>
