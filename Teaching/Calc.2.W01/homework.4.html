<b>Homework 3:  Due Friday 2 February, except as noted below  </b><p>


I think most of the integrals will be fairly straightforward to do
once you get them set up.  However, If you want to use Maple to help
you with any of these problems, feel free to do so. 
For info on how to use Maple, go to <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Maple">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Maple</a>. 
Be sure to read both the "general Maple advice" and also the answers
to Frequently Asked Question #3. 
<p><br>


<b>Section 8.1</b>
<ol>
<li>1 (5 points)
<li>3 (15 points)
<li>5 (15 points)
<li>8 (15 points)
<li>15 (15 points)
</ol>
<p><br>


<b>Volume of a Donut</b>
Compute the volume of a solid torus (aka a donut) with inner radius R
and outer radius r.  Be sure to label r and R on a diagram; there are
different ways to define them.  For ... um ... more about donuts,
check out <a href="http://www.ior.com/~mikej/donuts.html">this web
site</a>. (30 points)<p><br>

<b>Surface Areas and a trip to the Moon</b>
In answering the following questions, you should derive any surface
area formula you use.  I suggest beginning by trying to use
integration to derive the formula for the surface area of a sphere.
Start this problem this week, but it won't be due until next week.
This problem isn't easy.  (50 points total) 


<ol>
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible from the moon?
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible if you are 35,000
feet above the surface of the earth?
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible from a satellite
orbiting 280 km above the surface of the earth?
</ol>
