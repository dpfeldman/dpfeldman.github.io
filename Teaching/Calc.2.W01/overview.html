<h3>Course Overview
</h3>As our primary text we will again use <i>Calculus</i>, second
edition, by Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. I would like to cover
almost all of chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9.  I think this is a fairly
leisurely pace; we might have one or two extra classes to do some
additional topics or applications; let me know if you have any
requests. <p>


I have several goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to gain a firmer understanding of the big ideas of
calculus, in particular, the definite and indefinite integrals.

<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want you to learn independently about a topic of your choosing.

<li>I want you to gain experience orally presenting technical
information. 

<li>I want to have fun while learning some neat stuff.

</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 55 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Presentation:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/ADMISSIONS/Registrar/CourseCatalog/AcademicPlanning/records.html">page 8</a>
of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br>

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Calc.2.W01"> http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Calc.2.W01</a>.
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning this
in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your grade.  
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li> Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
You may not, however, get any help from any humans during the exam.
<li> Information on what is expected for your final presentation can be
found <a href="projects.html">in a separate document</a>. 
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading, and come prepared with written questions.  Click <a
href="preparation.html">here</a> for details.  
<li>In order to make time for final presntations, we'll need to
schedule a few extra classes toward the end of the term.
<li>Instead of me presenting examples, I plan on assigning a short
    problem that a pair of students will present in class.  This
    presentation is highly informal.
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  
<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  
<li>I expect you to attend class and labs.
<li> We will be using the computer algebra system Maple more
frequently this term.  Unlike in Calculus I, we'll be doing stuff on
Maple that your graphing calculators won't be able to handle.  If you
haven't learned to love Maple yet, you will soon.  
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
