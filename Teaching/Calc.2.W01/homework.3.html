<b>Homework 3:  Due Friday 26 January  </b><p>


For the problems from Sections 7.2 and 7.3, you should use Maple to
do the integrals.  (Well, you don't have to, but it'll be much, much
faster if you do.)  For 7.7, you can use Maple to check your work, but
you should do the problems by hand and show your steps.  For info on
how to use Maple, go to <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Maple">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Maple</a>. 
Be sure to read both the "general Maple advice" and also the answers
to Frequently Asked Question #3. 
<p><br>


<b>Section 7.2</b>
<ol>
<li>18, 20, 22, 24. (15 points)
<li> 39. (15 points)
</ol>


<b>Section 7.3</b>
<ol>
<li>20, 22, 24, 26.  (15 points)
<li>28, 29, 30, 31. (15 points)
<li>53.  This might be easier to do by hand instead of using
Maple.  This sort of integral comes up quite frequently in Fourier
analysis and differential equations.  (15 points)  
</ol>

<b>Section 7.7</b>
<ol>
<li>2, 4, 6, 8.  (20 points)
<li>28.  Hint:  let w= (x-a)/b^1/2.  (15 points)
<li>29.  Not as hard as it looks. (15 points)
</ol>
