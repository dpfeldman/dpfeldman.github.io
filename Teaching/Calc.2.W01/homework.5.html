<b>Homework 5:  Due Friday 9 February </b><p>


Feel free to use Maple for any of the problems in this
assignment.<p><br>

<ol>
<li>2 (15 points)
<li>5 (15 points) Be careful with units.
<li>13 (15 points)
</ol>
<p><br>


<b>Surface Areas and a trip to the Moon</b>
In answering the following questions, you should derive any surface
area formula you use.  I suggest beginning by trying to use
integration to derive the formula for the surface area of a sphere.
(50 points total) <P>
<ol>
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible from the moon?
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible if you are 35,000
feet above the surface of the earth?
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible from a satellite
orbiting 280 km above the surface of the earth? <p><br>
</ol>

<b>Poiseuille's Law</b>
High blood pressure results from constriction of the arteries.  to
maintain the same flow rate the heart has to pump harder, thus
increasing the blood pressure.  Use Poiseuille's Law to show that if Ro
and Po are normal values of the radius and pressure in an artery and
the constricted values are R and P, then for the flux to remain
constant, P and R are related by the equation P/Po = (R/Ro)^4 .
Deduce that if the radius of an artery is reduced to three-fourths of
its former value, then the pressure is more than tripled.  Poiseuille
is in the <a

Mechanics Hall of Fame</a>.
