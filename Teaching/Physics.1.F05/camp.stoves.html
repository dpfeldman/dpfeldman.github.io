<b> Note: We should formulate a plan for taking measurements before
you start generating data.</b><p><br> 

Compare the efficiencies of several different backpacking stoves.  It
seems to me that there are at least two sorts of efficiencies to
measure: how long it take to heat something up, and how much fuel is
required to heat something up.  <p>

To calculate these efficiencies you'll want to have the stoves perform
some standard task -- perhaps start with water at some standard 
temperature and raise it to a full boil.  Try to do your test under as
similar conditions as possible. How does the thermal energy released
from burning your fuel compare with the estimates from our textbook?<p>


Other possibilities for things to investigate:
<ul>
<li>How do the stoves perform under windy conditions?  How much help
is a windscreen?<p>
<li>For multi-fuel stoves, how do the performances of the depend on
the type of fuel used?
</ul>
