<h3>Fermi Problems</h3>


I'm looking for order of magnitude estimates, not precise answers!
You should round off with reckless abandon, and avoid using a
calculator if at all possible.  

<ol>

<li>Estimate the speed, in mph, at which human hair grows.

<li>Estimate the average speed, in mph, at which a human grows
from age 0 to 18.

<li>Estimate the total volume of all the blood of all the people in
the world.  Do some conversion or something that would help one
picture or get a feel for how much this volume is.

<li>Estimate the number of piano tuners in Boston.

<p>
<br>
</ol>

<h3>FCI</h3>

Take the force concept inventory diagnostic.  Thanks.<p>
 <br>

<h3>A little brain teaser</h3>
You have a drawer containing 8 blue socks, 10 green socks, and 12
orange socks.  You would like to wear a matching pair of socks.  You
grab socks one at a time from the draw.  What is the maximum number of
socks you need to draw before you have a matching pair in your hands?<p>


<p><br>

<h3>Ratios</h3>
 At the alternative market, $3$ pounds of lentils cost $5$ dollars. 
Answer the following questions using plain, everyday language.  Do not
use the word ``per''. 
<ol>
<li> What is the meaning of the number $5/3$?
<li> What is the meaning of the number $3/5$? 
<li> How much do $11$ pounds of lentils cost?
<li> How many pounds of lentils can you get for $11$ dollars? 
</ol>
