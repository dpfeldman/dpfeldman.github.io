<h1>Lab 2: Air Tracks and Sextants</h1><p>
<p>
Winter 2004.<p>
<br>
General instructions.
<ol>
<li>Please check with me or one of the TAs before going on to the next
exercise.  
<li>Please hand in only one write-up per group.
</ol>


<p>

<h3>Air Tracks</h3><p>
 
Don't worry about getting terribly precise results.  However, do make
velocity measurements as well as you can. </b>
 
<ol>
<li>Level the air track.
<li> Take a cart and give it a shove.  What happens to the cart?
What interactions is the cart participating in?
<li> Reproduce the experiment discussed in Figure C3.3.
<li> Reproduce the experiment discussed in Figure C3.4.
<li> Reproduce the experiment discussed in Figure C3.5.
<li> Imagine a situation where two carts collide, but they stick
together?  What do you think would happen?  Be sure to write down your
prediction.  Then do the experiment.  Use duct tape to make the carts
stick.  
</ol>
 
<h3>Sextants</h3><p>
 
<b>Trigonometry Warm Up.</b>
 
<ol>
<li> You stand 50 meters away from a flag pole.
You have to look at an angle of 53 degrees from the horizon to see the
top of the pole.  What is the pole's height?
 
<li>  You stand 75 meters away from a tree that's 100 meters tall.
At what angle must you tilt your head so that you look straight at the
top of the tree?
</ol>
<p>
 
<b>Applied Trigonometry</b>
 
<ol>
<li> Grab a sextant (or two).  Go outside and figure out how to use
it.  (Read the manual and talk to me.)
 
<li>  Measure the height of the large pine tree on the North end of
the field between the dorms and the arts and sciences building.
 
</ol>

<h3>Operational Definition of Mass</h3>
Note:  I'm not sure how well this is going to work.  But let's give it
a try.  Even if it doesn't "work", I think it'll still be worthwhile.  
<ol>
<li>Re-read the first part of section C3.4 where mass is defined
operationally.
<li>Set up the experiment as best you can.  You'll probably want to 
make "tracks" for the different balls to roll in.
<li>Determine the mass of one of the balls.  What units is your answer
in? 
<li>Compare with the weight of the balls measured on one of the scales
in the lab.
</ol>


<!--<h3>Dimensional Analysis </h3>
From P. Tipler, <i> Physics for Scientists and Engineers</i>, Third
edition, Worth Publishers, 1991.

<ol>
<li> The period T of a simple pendulum depends on the length L of
the pendulum and the strength of earth's gravitational field g.
Find a simple combination of L and g that has the dimensions of
time.  The quantity g has dimension of length/time^2. 

<li> Check the dependence of the period T on the length L by
measuring the period for three different values of L.  (The period
T is defined as the time for a complete to-and-fro swing.)

<li> The correct formula involves a numerical factor that is
dimensionless and hence can't be obtained by dimensional analysis.
Using your data from the above question, estimate the value of the
numerical factor.
