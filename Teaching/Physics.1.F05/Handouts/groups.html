The group problem solving approach discussed below is based on
"Cooperative Group Problem Solving in Physics" by Pat Heller and Ken
Heller (University of Minnesota), available at, <a
  href="http://www.physics.umn.edu/groups/physed/Research/CGPS/GreenBook.html">http://www.physics.umn.edu/groups/physed/Research/CGPS/GreenBook.html
</a>.  Heller and Heller are members of the <a
  href="http://www.physics.umn.edu/groups/physed/index.html">University
  of Minnesota Physics Education Group</a>.<p>

<br>
For many lab exercises, you will work in group problem solving teams
of three.  Each group member will choose a role.  You should rotate
these roles from lab to lab.  Here are the different roles:<p>
<br>


<table align=center width=80% border=2 cellpadding=4>

<tr>
<th width=13%>Role  </th>
<th>Actions </th>
<th>Typical Statements </th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> <b>Manager</b> </td>
<td> Guide the steps used to solve the problem.<br>
Keep group on-task<br>
Make sure everyone participates<br>
Keep track of time<br>
</td>
<td> "We need to move to the next step."<br>
"Pat, what do you think of this idea?" <br>
"Let's come back to this later if we have time." </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Recorder/checker</b></td>
<td> Act as a scribe; only the recorder/checker should write the
write-up<br> 
Check to make sure that all group members understand each
step of the solution<br>
Make sure all group members agree on plans and actions<br>
Make sure everyone's name is on the write-up<br>
</td>
<td> "Does everyone understand this step?"<br>
"Explain why you think that."<br>
"Is there agreement that this is the way to proceed?"<br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Skeptic</b></td>
<td> Help prevent your group from coming to agreement too quickly<br>
Make sure lots of options are explored<br>
Suggest alternatives<br>
</td>
<td> "What other possibilities are there?"<br>
"I'm not sure we're on the right track."<br>
"What if we look at the problem a different way?"<br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Energizer/Summarizer</b><br>
only if there are four people in group</td>
<td> Watch for lulls in motivation or energy<br>
Suggest new ideas<br>
Listen carefully and summarize ideas<br>
Help group stay positive<br>
</td>
<td> "So here's what we've decided ... "<br>
"What I'm hearing is that ... " <br>
"I'm sure things aren't as bad as we think."<br>
</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p><br>

At the end of the lab, your group will spend a few minutes <a
href="eval.html">reflecting on</a> how the group functioned.
