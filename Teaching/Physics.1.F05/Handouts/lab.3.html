<b>Two-Dimensional Momentum Conservation</b><p>
 
Consider the multiflash photograph of a collision of two billiard
balls.  Assume that the time interval between flashes is .1 second.
Do the measurements below reasonably carefully.
 
<ol>
<li> Choose a coordinate system.  (A clever choice will make the
problem a little easier.)
 
<li> Determine the velocity vectors for each of the balls before and
after the collision.  Write the vector as both a magnitude and
direction and in component form.
 
<li>  Determine the momentum of the system before and after the
collision.  Write your answer as both a magnitude and direction and in
component form.
 
<li>  Is momentum conserved?
 
</ol>

<h3>Dimensional Analysis </h3>
From P. Tipler, <i> Physics for Scientists and Engineers</i>, Third
edition, Worth Publishers, 1991.
 
<ol>
<li> The period T of a simple pendulum depends on the length L of
the pendulum and the strength of earth's gravitational field g.
Find a simple combination of L and g that has the dimensions of
time.
 
<li> Check the dependence of the period T on the length L by
measuring the period for three different values of L.  (The period
T is defined as the time for a complete to-and-fro swing.)
 
<li> The correct formula involves a numerical factor that is
dimensionless and hence can't be obtained by dimensional analysis.
Using your data from the above question, estimate the value of the
numerical factor.
