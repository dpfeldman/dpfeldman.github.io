<h2>Lab 6: Angular Momentum</h2>
<h4>Fall 2005</h4>
<p>

<h4>Angular Momentum</h4>
 
<b>Be careful!</b>  It's possible to lose your balance and fall
down while doing these.  Do the following experiments.  (Each person
in your group should do at least one of these.  If no other groups are
waiting for the rotating platform, everyone should try each.)
<ol>
  <li> Stand on the ground.  Spin of the bicycle wheel and hold it
  horizontally.  Then get on the platform.  Turn the bicycle wheel
  upside down.
  <li> Stand on the platform and hold the wheel.  (The wheel shouldn't
  be spinning yet.)  Then, hold the wheel horizontally and give it a
  spin.
  <li>  Hold the two heavy weights and stand on the platform.  Have
  someone give you a gentle spin.  Move the weights in and out.
  <li>  Stand on the platform and hold something heavy and
  unbreakable.
  <ul>
    <li>Throw the heavy thing in such a manner that you end up
    rotating after the throw.
    <li>Throw the heavy thing equally hard, but now throw it so that
    you don't rotate after the throw.
  </ul>
</ol>
