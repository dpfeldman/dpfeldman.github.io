<h2 align=center>Lab 7:  Motion Diagrams and Stove Testing</h2>
<b>Fall 2005</b><p>

<b>Motion Diagrams:</b>

<ol>
<li>A bug crawls at a constant velocity of 2cm/s.   
<ol>
  <li>Make a motion diagram for the bug.
  <li>Make a careful plot of the bug's position, velocity, and
  acceleration vs. time.  Use a different set of axes for each plot. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> Ticker timer:
<ol>
<li>Make a motion diagram for something falling using the ticker
timer.  
<li>Draw the velocity and acceleration arrows.  Do this for around 5
dots.   
<li>Then make a plot of the position, velocity, and
acceleration vs. time.  Use a different set of axes for each plot.
</ol>
</ol>

<b>Testing the Stoves</b>
As part of this lab we'll also compare the efficiency of the different
stoves we made last week.
