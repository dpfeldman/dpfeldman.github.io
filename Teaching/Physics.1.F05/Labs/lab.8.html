<h2 align=center>Lab 8: Forces</h2>
<b>Fall 2005</b><p>

<b>Forces:</b>

<ol>
<li>Examine the hanging mass apparatus thingey and:
<ol>
  <li>Determine the mass of the hanging object.
  <li>Measure the angle of two strings that suspend the object.
  <li>Read the tension in the strings on the scales. 
</ol>
<li>Using the techniques we developed in class yesterday, calculate
the tension in each of the strings.  
<li>Compare your calculated tensions to the measured tensions.  To do
so, you'll need to convert the spring scale measurement to Newtons.
</ol>
<p>


<b>More Cartoon Physics</b>
<ol>
<li>Do the cartoon physics handouts.  Debate and discuss the answers
amongst your group.
<li>When you are done, look at the answers and see if you got them
right. 
</ol>
