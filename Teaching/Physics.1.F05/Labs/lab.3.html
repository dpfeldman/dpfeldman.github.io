<h1>Physics I, Lab 3: </h1><p>
<p>
Fall 2005<p>
 
<b>General instructions</b>
<ol>
<li>Please work in groups of two or three.
<li>Please write up a short response/answer for each of the
exercises. 
<li>Please hand in only one write-up per group.
</ol>


<h3>Two-Dimensional Momentum Conservation</h3><p>
 
Consider the multiflash photograph of a collision of two billiard
balls.  Assume that the time interval between flashes is .1 second.
Do the measurements below reasonably carefully.
 
<ol>
<li> Choose a coordinate system.  (A clever choice will make the
problem a little easier.)
 
<li> Determine the velocity vectors for each of the balls before and
after the collision.  Write the vector in component form.
 
<li>  Determine the momentum of the system before and after the
collision.  Write your answer in component form.
 
<li>  Is momentum conserved?
 
</ol>
<p>


<h3>Estimation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Estimate the amount of tea currently in China.
<li>If the land of the earth were divided up equally, what area of
land would each person get?
</ol>
 
<h3>Dimensional Analysis </h3>
From P. Tipler, <i> Physics for Scientists and Engineers</i>, Third
edition, Worth Publishers, 1991.
 
<ol>
<li> The period T of a simple pendulum depends on the length L of
the pendulum and the strength of earth's gravitational field g.
Find a simple combination of L and g that has the dimensions of
time.
 
<li> Check the dependence of the period T on the length L by
measuring the period for three different values of L.  (The period
T is defined as the time for a complete to-and-fro swing.)
 
<li> The correct formula involves a numerical factor that is
dimensionless and hence can't be obtained by dimensional analysis.
Using your data from the above question, estimate the value of the
numerical factor.
