<h3 align=center>Physics I, Lab 5: Rolling Stuff and Specific Heat</h3><p>
<h4>Fall 2005</h4>

<h3>Rolling Stuff</h3>

Consider a disk and a hoop. Suppose the objects are released from rest
and allowed to roll down an incline. The incline has length L and one
end is raised to a height of h. 

   1. Determine an expression for the velocity of the hoop at the
   bottom of the incline. 
   2. Determine a similar expression for the velocity of the disk.
   3. Calculate the ratio of the two velocities.
   4. Make measurements of the velocities of the hoop and the disk at
   the bottom of the incline. (Take several measurements and average
   your results.) 
   5. Does your experimental velocity ratio agree with the theoretical
   velocity ratio? 



<h3>Specific Heat</h3>
Suppose you place a hot piece of metal in a styrofoam cup containing
some water. By how much will the temperature of the water increase?
Try this out with one of the known pieces of metal. <p>

<h3>The Cost of Doing This Lab</h3>
Using the watt-meter, estimate how much it costs to leave the hot
plate on for the entire 4 hour lab.
