<br>

<b>Due by the end of the term</b><p>

There are two options.  Do one of the following.



<ol>

<li><b>Empirical network exploration:</b>  Download one of the network
  data sets
  available <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/">here</a> 
  or <a href="https://nwb.slis.indiana.edu/community/?n=Datasets.HomePage">here</a>,
  or elsewhere.  Prepare a brief, informal technical report or a slide
  presentation which contains the following
<ol>
  <li>Calculations of basic descriptive statistics:  average path
  length, average clustering coefficient, diameter
  <li>The degree distribution, plotted as a histogram
  <li>Several different visualizations of all or part of the network.
  For each visualization, say what features of the nextwork you are
  highlighting or emphasizing.
  <li>Write one or two paragraphs about what you think is interesting
  about the network.  
  <li>Write a few paragraphs proposing some further work concerning
  the network.  What question(s) could you ask of this data, and why
  might the answer to those questions be interesting.  Your proposal
  could entail further analysis on the data and/or plans to gather
  additional data.
</ol>
You can work in pairs if you wish.<p>


<li><b>Wikipedia writing:</b> Write a new wikipedia entry or add some
  new content to existing entries. You should aim to add around 500
  words to wikipedia.  What you write about should be at least loosely
  related to the content of this course.   

</ol>
