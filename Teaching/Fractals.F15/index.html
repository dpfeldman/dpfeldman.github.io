This course will give students a modern overview of the mathematics
and statistics of fractals and scaling and their interdisciplinary
applications. We will begin with mathematical fractals and use them to
define several different notions of dimension, standard ways for
describing the nature of fractals' self similarity. Students will then
learn modern statistical techniques for reliably estimating fractal
dimensions and power law exponents. We will also look more generally
at "fat-tailed" distributions, a class of distributions of which power
laws are a subset. Next we will turn our attention to learning about
some of the many processes that can generate fractals. Finally, we
will critically examine some recent applications of fractals and
scaling in natural and social systems, including metabolic scaling,
finance, and urban studies. These are, arguably, among the most
successful and surprising areas of application of fractals and
scaling; they are also areas of current scientific controversy. This
course can thus serve as a case study of the promises and pitfalls of
interdisciplinary mathematical research. Students who successfully
complete this course will gain: a thorough, mathematically grounded
understanding of fractals and scaling; increased skills in applied
mathematics; experience using modern statistical techniques
(maximum-likelihood estimators and goodness-of-fit-tests for discrete
and continuous data); and experience reading and critiquing current
literature in applied mathematics. Course evaluation will be based on
several problem sets, participation in seminar-style class sessions, a
final pedagogical presentation, and a short final report and annotated
bibliography. Some computer work in R will be required, but no prior R
experience is necessary. Level: Advanced. Prerequisites: Calculus II
or the equivalent, and at least one of the following: Linear Algebra,
Differential Equations, programming experience. A class in statistics
will be helpful, but is not required. Permission of instructor.
