<p>
<br>

<h4>Overview</h4>

The final project should be an in-depth exploration of a particular
application of differential equations.  Alternatively, you can
work on thoroughly understanding a particular method of solution,
numerical or analytic.  In your project you should strive for depth;
avoid doing a broad survey.  You should also <i>do something</i>, as
opposed to merely reading about stuff.<p>

<br>
<h4>Initial pre-presentation</h4>
Approximately week five (we'll set the date later), you will give an
initial presentation in which you introduce your topic.  You
should give a sense of what you'll be doing the next several weeks and
the questions you'll wish to address.  There are several goals for
this initial presentation.
<ol>
<li>Force you to choose a topic early rather than later.
<li>Let other people in the class know what you're up to; get feedback
and ideas from others.
<li>Give you a chance to practice giving technical presentations.
You'll get feedback on your presentation from both me and classmates.
</ol>

Since the pre-presentation is intended for people in the class, it
will likely be rather technical.  Presentations will be around 10-15
minutes.  You should use overhead transparencies.  Powerpoint is
strongly discouraged.<p>

We may have to prolong class or schedule an evening session so we can
have all the presentations on the same day.<p>

<br>

<h4>Final Presentations</h4>

Sometime during week 10 we will give presentations in a session open to
the community.  This will probably be Monday of week 10.  In a few weeks
we will decide on a format.  The session will involve some combination
of talks, posters, and papers. <p><br>
