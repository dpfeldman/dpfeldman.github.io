<h1 align=center> Odes: Useful Links</h1><p>
<p>
<br>


This list isn't at all comprehensive.  <p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://math.bu.edu/odes">Boston University ODES
project</a>  The homepage for our text.<p>


<li><a
href="http://www.mapleapps.com/categories/mathematics/desolving/acdesolving.html">Maple
Applications</a>. A set of differential equations applications for
Maple.  Could be some excellent resources here.<p>


<li>
<a href="http://www.sci.wsu.edu/idea/current.html">IDEA: Internet
Differential Equations Activities</a>, "an interdisciplinary effort to
provide students and teachers around the world with computer based
activities for differential equations in a wide variety of
disciplines."  It looks like they have some great material for
interesting projects, buildup of toxins, chemical reactions, rangeland
ecosystems, salmon migration, small mammal dispersion, etc.
Definitely worth checking out! <p>

<li> The <a
href="http://www.math.duke.edu/education/ccp/materials/diffeq/index.html">Connected
Curriculum Project</a> at Duke has some interesting modules on
applications of differential equations. <p>

<li> Some differential equations projects and other resources are
available at <a
href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~glarose/courseinfo/diffeq/">Gavin
Larose's DiffEQ Resource Page</a> <p>

<li><a
href="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/differential/differential.html">Internet
Resources for Differential Equations</a> at Swarthmore's math forum.
Many excellent links here.
