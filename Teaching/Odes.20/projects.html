<p><b>This class is designed to help you transition from being a
    reader, to being read, from being someone who listens, to someone
    who is listened to.</b></p>

<p>Research is an essential component of almost any area of study and
  field of work. Learning what research is, how to think about it, and
  how to do it well, are extremely important skills---ones that you will
  use in many, many areas beyond differential equations and
  mathematics. I think research skills are important enough that it is
  worth devoting a considerable fraction of this class to them.</p>

<p>Overview: The research project should be an in-depth exploration of
  a particular application of differential equations. It may also be
  possible to do a more theoretical project. We will spend the first
  few weeks of the term talking about what research is, how to move
  from an area of interest to a topic, and how to relate a research
  question to a broader set of questions or concerns. There are three
  major "deliverables" associated with the project:</p> 
<ol>
  <li><b>Initial Presentation</b>: During week five you will give an
  initial presentation in which you introduce your topic. You should
  give a sense of what you'll be doing the next several weeks and the
  questions you'll wish to address. There are three reasons for this
  initial presentation.
  <ul>
    <li>It will force you to choose a topic early rather than later.
    <li>It will let other people in the class know what you're up to,
        so you can get feedback and ideas from others. 
    <li>It will give you a chance to practice giving technical
    presentations. You'll get feedback on your presentation from both
    me and classmates.
      </ul>
  <li><b>Final Presentations</b>: Sometime during week 10 we will give
    presentations in a session open to the community. These talks will
    follow the format of contributed talks at a scientific meeting.
  <li><b>Paper or Technical Report</b>: Due on the last day of the
  term. This will be a 5-20 page paper on your research question. You
  should write in a style appropriate for publication in peer-reviewed
  journal of your choosing. (If you want to explore another form, this
  is possible, but you should clear this with me early on.) Your paper
  must be well-formatted, include figures and graphs as appropriate,
  and correctly use the citation format standard for whichever journal
  you choose.
</ol>

<p>Throughout the term we will spend time discussing a number of
  issues and ideas in research, and also cover some specific research
  skills. This will likely include: 
<ul>
  <li>The difference between interests, topics, questions, and problems
  <li>The mechanics of peer-reviewed journals and academic publishing
  <li>The rhetorical style of research papers
  <li>How to search for sources, including using the citation lists available in Google scholar
  <li>How to give an effective technical presentation
  <li>Ethics in research, plagiarism and academic fraud, issues surrounding research on human subjects
  <li>Software for organizing and automating bibliographies
</ul></p>

<p>I probably will also divide you up into small groups based on
similarity of interests and ask your groups to meet and/or share
resources.</p> 

<p>A few of these discussions may sound not that interesting, but give
them a shot. In the past students have found these topics to be useful
and quite helpful.</p> 

<p>It is inevitable that some of you will "get farther" in your projects
than others, since some of you are farther along in your
studies. Also, some research topics are harder to make progress on
than others. This diversity is fine. The point of the projects is not
to come up with publishable original research or even have an amazing
and polished final result. Rather, the idea is to strive toward as
good a result as possible, and learn a lot (and challenge yourself and
have fun) while doing so.<p> 

<p>Finally, as you may have guessed, I suspect that these research
projects will be a lot of work. But with a good topic and the right
attitude, I think this work can be very fun and rewarding. And I think
doing a term-long project like this will be very helpful before
undertaking your final project or a research internship somewhere.</p>
