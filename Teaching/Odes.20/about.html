  <h2>Textbook</h2>
</header>
<p>There is no textbook for this course. We will use some online
  resources and I will distribute articles and perhaps some of my own
  notes. </p>



<header class="align-center">
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
</header>
<p>Your evaluation will be based roughly as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Homework assignments (25%)
  <li>Research project (70%)
  <li>Class participation (5%) 
</ul>

<!--I recommend against grades; I believe they are more likely than --
--not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning. -->
I will assign
grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines in the COA
Course Catalog. I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.  </p>

  <h2>More Detailed Info</h2>
</header>

<ol>
<li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day. More
    than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
    mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
    lowering of your grade. 
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
    also consult me, other faculty, friends, and family. However, the
    homework you hand in should represent your own understanding. This
    means that if your friends get a homework problem and you don't
    understand how they did it, you shouldn't photocopy their solution
    and turn it in.
<li>You will need regular and reliable access to a computer that has
    python on it. If you need a loaner laptop from the school, please
    let me know.
<li>I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's important
    that you check your email. 
<li>There will sometimes be reading to do before class. It is
    important that you do the reading and come ready to discuss and
    ask questions. 
<li> Unless we have made arrangements in advance, you are expected to 
  come to class and participate in group exercises.  
<li>If either COA or MDIHS are cancelled due to snow or other winter
  calamities, class will (almost surely) not meet.  Regardless of
  official cancellations, if you feel that it is not safe for you to
  come to class, don't come to class.
<li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is subscribing 
    to common standards of academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism,
    falsifying or fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A
    student must make it his or her responsibility to not use words or
    works of others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is
    unacceptable and evidence of such activity is reported to the
    academic dean or his/her designee. Two violations of academic
    integrity are grounds for dismissal from the college. Students
    should request in-class discussions of such questions when complex
    issues of ethical scholarship arise.
<li>You should expect to spend 150 hours of academically engaged time
  on this course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per
  week in class, in a typical week you'll spend 2.5 hours reading and
  preparing for class and 8 hours attending help sessions, completing
  assignments, and working on your research project.
</ol>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>what's the deal with this course?</p>
  <h2>Other Thoughts</h2>
</header>
<ol>
<li>I've taught this class four times before, and each time it's gone
    quite well. This year will be very similar to the version of the
    course I offered in 2014. So I'm pretty confident of how most
    things will go. 
<li>This class is listed as an intermediate/advanced (I) class. It's
    not I because we'll be doing super hard, super tricky
    math. Rather, it's I because of what you'll be asked to do with
    some mostly straightforward math. You'll be asked to think with
    math and to use math creatively. You will also be expected to
    think about the structure of research and improve research
    skills. 
<li>This class makes extensive use of ideas from calculus. It's
    important that you've had both differential calculus before and
    felt reasonably good about the experience, although it's ok if
    you've forgotten much of it.  We will use the idea of a derivative
    almost daily, but we will rarely use the mechanics of calculus.
<li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
    confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
    sooner rather than later. 
<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
    first time. The style of homework assignments in this class might
    be very different from what you're used to. Don't let yourself get
    frustrated. I strongly suggest working with others and seeking
    help if you need it. 
<li>There will be few, if any, quick plug-in assignments. This class
    is not so much about mathematical calisthenics. Rather, there will
    be only a few problems, but they will be longer, requiring
    multiple steps. On some occasions you will be asked to form your
    own mathematical model as part of a problem. 
<li>You will learn some of the basic elements of the python
    programming language. This is not a full course in python by any
    means; my goal is to teach you just enough so you can use it for
    what we need in this course, and also give you enough fundamentals
    so that you can learn further on your own if you want. I'm
    confident that this will work well. 
<li>This course is structured to allow you to do a significant project
    as part of the coursework. You will need to start early on this
    and keep moving throughout the term. There will be numerous
    check-points throughout the term, including an oral presentation
    during week five. Falling behind in your project can be
    disastrous. 
<li>Throughout I will be taking a (hyper) "modern" approach to
    differential equations. I emphasize qualitative, global analysis
    of differential equations, rather than specialized analytic
    tricks. We will frequently rely on numerical solutions to
    differential equations. We will use computers without guilt or
    apology to help us do mathematics and science. All of this might
    give the course a different feel than other math classes you've
    taken. 
<li>There are three parts to this course: differential equations,
  python, and research projects. These strands will flow more or less
  in parallel. I don't think this will be a problem, but it may be
  just a tiny bit schizophrenic at first.  
</ol>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>you can get help, and a lot more, at help sessions</b>
  <h2>Help Sessions</h2>
</header>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions.
You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these sessions.
Things that happen at help session:
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.
  <li>Other students do the problems at home or in the library and
    come to the help session with specific questions. 
  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also wander into other areas: politics,
    the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes are
    offered next term, and so on.
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.
</ol>
Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>there are lots of good reasons why you might want to meet with me
    one-on-one</p>
  <h2>Individual Meetings</h2>
</header>
I am happy to meet with students one-on-one, either in my office or in
the dining hall.  The best way to set up an appointment is to send me
an email.  There are lots of reasons why you might want to me:
<ol>
  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
    explore in a help session.
  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
  uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
  uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
  questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
  nevertheless.)
  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
    internships, senior projects, etc.
</ol>  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
discuss. </p>
