<p><b>Course Goals</b>
<ol>
<li>Gain a solid introduction to differential equations: learn what
  differential equations are, be able to formulate original
  mathematical models using differential equations, and be able to
  use a variety of techniques to solve and understand differential
  questions, including numerical and qualitative methods.  
<li>Gain experience conceptualizing, carrying out, and presenting
  research. This includes conceptualizing and framing research
  questions and problems, conducing a literature review, presenting
  results in a professional-style research talk, and writing up
  results in a style appropriate for publication. 
<li>Gain experience with scientific computing and writing programs to
  help you carry out mathematical analysis.  
</ol>


<blockquote>
  <p>
Abstraction is seen as an active process which both enlightens and
obscures. Abstractions are not true or false but relatively
enlightening or obscuring according to the problem under study;
different abstractions may grasp different aspects of a
problem. Abstractions may be useless if they can answer questions only
about themselves. A theoretical enterprise explores reality through
acluster of abstractions that use different perspectives, temporal and
horizontal scales, and assumes different givens. ...</p>

<p>Abstracting is only one part of the process of seeking
understanding. The inverse process is the return to world from which
the abstractions were made.  I am not concerned here with the familiar
statistical hypothesis testing or Popperian falsification that results
in a hypothesis being accepted or rejected. We may get good
statistical fit without knowing the system any better if too much  has
been left out, or we may get good answers to the wrong
questions. Rather the inquiry is whether the processes of abstraction
as a whole and the observations they lead to have increased our
understanding of the world and offered some guide to action for
deepening our understanding or making the world a better place.</p>

<p><b>ES3022M.  Differential Equations: Official Course
    Description</b></p>

<p>Differential equations are an application of calculus used to model a
wide variety of physical and natural phenomena. The rate at which a
cup of coffee cools, populations of predators and prey in ecosystems,
the spread of disease, and the behavior of electric circuits, are all
examples of systems that have been described with differential
equations. This course is an introduction to ordinary differential
equations, intended for students who have completed a single-variable
calculus course. The course covers a variety of techniques for solving
and understanding differential equations, including numerical and
qualitative solution methods. Students will learn to solve and analyze
differential equations using the python programming language. Students
will also gain experience formulating mathematical models using
differential equations. To do so, we will discuss general modeling
principles and also consider several case studies. In addition to
learning the mathematics of differential equations, a central goal of
this course is to gain skills necessary for research in the
mathematical, natural, and social sciences. This includes
conceptualizing and framing a research question, conducing a
literature review, giving a research presentation, and writing up
results in a style appropriate for publication.</p>

<p>Evaluation will be based on class participation, bi-weekly problem
sets, and a term-long project culminating in a presentation and short
research paper.</p>

<p>Level: Intermediate.</p>

<p>PREREQUISITES: Calculus II or the equivalent or permission of
  instructor.  Introduction to python, or the equivalent, or
  permission of instructor.</p>

<p>Lab Fee: None.</p>

<p>Meets the following degree requirements:  ES, QR</p>


<hr>
<p>The building in which our class meets, and all of College of the
Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the Wabanaki people.  The
four Native American tribes in Maine today are the Maliseet, Micmac,
Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy, collectively referred to as the
  Wabanaki.
  <!-- Although largely a technical class, we will touch upon
  questions of energy colonialism and imperialism.-->
I believe it is important to acknowledge that our presence on this
  land entangles us in the web of colonialism, past and present.  The
  future, however, is still unwritten.</p>

<!--<p>In this class we will learn about non-fossil fuel sources of
  energy.  Transitioning to a fossil fuel free society is essential to
  avoid catastrophic climate change.  College of the Atlantic, and by
  extention all of us, presently benefit from energy provided by
  fossil fuel sources.  Again, we are entangled with the system that
  we seek to replace.</p> -->
