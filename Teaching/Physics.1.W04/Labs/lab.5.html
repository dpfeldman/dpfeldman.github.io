<h4>The Physics of Ball Point Pens</h4><p>
 
This experiment was described in Robert Ehrlich, <i>Why Toast Lands
Jelly-side Down: Zen and the Art of Physics Demonstrations</i>,
Princeton University Press, 1997.<p>
 
Find a ball point pen that has a retractable head and a spring
inside.  Unscrew the pen and put aside the top part of the pen (the
half that has the "clicky thing" in it.)  By holding down the bottom
plastic part, compressing the spring, and letting go, you can launch
the plastic part into the air.  Give it a try.  <p>
 
We can use conservation of energy to predict how high the plastic part
should fly.  First, let's establish some notation:
 
<ol>
<li> m = mass of plastic projectile
<li> k = spring constant of the pen's spring
<li> M = mass with which we must compress the spring
<li> x = distance through which the spring is compressed
<li> h = maximum height of m
</ol>
 
Here's how we can use conservation of energy to calculate h.
 
<ol>
<li> Suppose we compress the spring by an amount x and then release
the mass m.  How high will the mass go?  Find an expression for h in
terms of k, g, and x.
 
<li> Measure x.  Do this by determining how much the string is
compressed when it's pressed in as far as possible.
 
<li> Measure m.  Use one of the digital scales in the chem lab.
 
<li> Measure k.  This is the tricky part.  It turns out that the
magnitude of the force needed to compress a spring a distance x is
equal to kx.  Here's how to measure the force.  When you press down on
the spring, the ground pushes back up on the ink cartridge an equal
and opposite amount.  Instead of resting the pen on the table, put the
end of the pen on the pan of a pan balance.  (You'll need to use one
of the larger pan balances in the chem lab.)  Adjust the mass on the
scale until it balances out your pushing down around when the spring
is completely compressed.  The force with which you're pushing down
the pen equals the force of gravity MG on the mass M on the scale.  Thus,
kx = Mg.
 
<li> Using your result from part 1 and your measurements, estimate h.
Then measure h using a meter stick.  You'll need to make sure that the
pen flies straight up, and that you release the pen top quickly.  How
close does the measured value agree with the calculated value?  Last
night I got an agreement to within around 10%.  The author of the
above-cited book claims that he was able to obtain agreement within
1 or 2 percent.<p>
