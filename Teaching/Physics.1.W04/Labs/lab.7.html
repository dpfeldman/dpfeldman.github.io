<h2 align=center>Lab 7:  Motion Diagrams</h2>
<p>
<b>Winter 2004</b><p>
<br>



<ol>
<li>A bicycle moves at a constant velocity of 2m/s.   
<ol>
  <li>Make a motion diagram for the bike.
  <li>Make a careful plot of the bicycle's position, velocity, and
  acceleration vs. time.  Use a different set of axes for each plot. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> Ticker timer:
<ol>
<li>Make a motion diagram for something falling using the ticker
timer.  
<li>Draw the velocity and acceleration arrows.  Do this for around 5
dots.   
<li>Then make a plot of the position, velocity, and
acceleration vs. time.  Use a different set of axes for each plot.
</ol>
<p>

<li>Circular motion
<ol>
<li>Complete a motion diagram for a situation in which an object is
moving in a circle at constant speed.
<li>Which way is the acceleration arrow pointing?
<li>What happens to the magnitude of the acceleration arrow if the
speed increases?
<li>What happens to the magnitude of the acceleration arrow if the
radius of the circle increases? 

</ol>
