<b>Angular Momentum</b>
 
<ol>
<li>Do the following experiments.  (Each person in your group should
do at least one of these.  If no other groups are waiting for the
rotating platform, everyone should try each.)
<ol>
  <li> Stand on the ground.  Spin of the bicycle wheel and hold it
  horizontally.  Then get on the platform.  Turn the bicycle wheel
  upside down.
  <li> Stand on the platform and hold the wheel.  (The wheel shouldn't
  be spinning yet.)  Then, hold the wheel horizontally and give it a
  spin.
  <li>  Hold the two heavy weights and stand on the platform.  Have
  someone give you a gentle spin.  Move the weights in and out.
  <li>  Stand on the platform and hold something heavy and
  unbreakable.
  <ul>
    <li>Throw the heavy thing in such a manner that you end up
    rotating after the throw.
    <li>Throw the heavy thing equally hard, but now throw it so that
    you don't rotate after the throw.
  </ul>
</ol>
 
<li>  Explain all of these phenomena using conservation of angular
momentum.

</ol>

<p><br>
<b>Motion Diagrams</b>
<ol>

<li> Ticker timer:
<ol>
<li>Make a motion diagram for something falling using the ticker
timer.
<li>Draw the velocity and acceleration arrows.  Do this for around 5
dots.
<li>Then make a plot of the position, velocity, and
acceleration vs. time.  (Use a different set of axes for each
plot.)<p>
</ol>

<li>Do the velocity handout.<p>

<li>A bicycle starts at rest and accelerates at 2  m/s^2 for 5
seconds.  It then coasts (at constant velocity) for another 5
seconds.  The bike then stops suddenly.  Make a careful plot of the
bicycle's position, velocity, and acceleration vs. time. 

</ol>
