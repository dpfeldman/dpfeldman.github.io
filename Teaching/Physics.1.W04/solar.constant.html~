You main task is to get the hydrogen fuel cell kit to work.  There's 
an instruction booklet that you should follow.  You'll need to set up
a time with me to get the fuel kit.<p>

Your write-up need not be extensive, but it should contain a sketch of
the apparatus and a brief discussion of how it works.  You should also
make a few measurements.  How much gas did you get, and how long did
it take to make?  How long did the fan run using this gas?<p>

Find at least one recent journal, magazine, or newspaper article about
fuel cells.  This shouldn't be hard.  What are people saying about
fuel cells these days?<p>
