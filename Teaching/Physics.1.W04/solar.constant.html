In this mini-project you will measure the solar intensity (i.e. the
power contained in incident sunlight).  An article in The Physics
Teacher had a very simple and clever method for doing so.  All you
need is a few Styrofoam cups and a few thermometers and some water.
If you want to do this project, let me know and I'll make copies of
the article for you.  It's only two pages long.<p>

No group has done this yet, since the article appeared only a few
months ago.  It would be great if an adventurous group gave this a
try.  I think it should work pretty well.<p>
