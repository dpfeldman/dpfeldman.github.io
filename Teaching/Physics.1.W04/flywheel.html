<b>Note:</b>  Some of this information might be out of date.  It would be
good to find some more recent references for this.<p>


<ol>

<li> Read the Article, ``Reinventing the Wheel'' by Will Hively in
<i>Discover</i>, vol. 17, no.8.  This article should be avilable in
our library.

<li> What is radius of the disks discussed in the fourth paragraph of
Hively's article?  (Calculate the radius using the revs per minute and
the speed on the edge of the disk given in the article.)

<li> Calculate how much energy can be stored by this 50 pound
disk.  State your answer in both Joules and kilowatt-hours.  

<li> How much would it cost in Maine to spin up this flywheel?
Assume that electricity can be converted to flywheel energy at 96%
efficiency.  

<li> Estimate how far a car powered by 16 such flywheels could go
between recharges.  One way to do this is to compare the energy stored
by the flywheels to the energy stored in gasoline.

<li> Estimate how much energy is stored by the flywheels in use in
the pottery studio.  (If you have questions about their specification,
ask Ernie---he made them.)  Your write-up should state how you arrived
at this estimate.  

<li> Do some web research and try to get a sense of where the "state
of the art" is in flywheels.  Are they in commercial production?
Could you purchase one for your home?
