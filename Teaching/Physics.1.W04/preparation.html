<p>
<br>

You should come to class with several questions and comments prepared.
Before class, while reading, you should do the following:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Write down each section heading in the chapter.
  <li>Underneath each section, make a list of what, if any,
  major questions you have about the reading.  
  <li> Also, if you have any
  comments:  (e.g., this was cool, I had always thought something
  different, etc.) write those down too.

</ul>

We will use these questions as a basis for discussion.  During class,
as questions get answered, put a check next to them.  Don't check off
questions that you're still unclear on.  You'll hand in the sheet to
me at the end of class. <p>

This will let me know what areas students are still confused about.  I
also think that by writing out questions beforehand, we'll be able to
make more efficient use of class time.<p>
