<dt><b>Homework 0:  Due Monday, September 14</b><p>
    <dd>
    <ol>
        <li>Send me an email at dave@hornacek.coa.edu.  I'll reply and
        add you to a class mailing list. 
	<li><b>BEFORE YOU READ THE TEXT</b> complete the Force Concept
        Inventory.
	<li>Do the assigned reading.  Come to class with one question
        and one comment on the reading.  I will often use your
        comments and questions as a starting point for class
        discussion.
	<li>Think about course structure and policies.

<dt><b>Homework 2:  Due Friday September 25 by 5PM.  </b><p>
  
  <dd> Fermi Problem:<ul>
          <li>You are visiting a local organic potato farm and are
          discussing the possibility of buying the farmer's potatoes
          to use in the COA dining hall.  The farmer is very
          interested and asks you approximately how many pounds of
          potatoes COA would need each month.  Come up with an order
          of magnitude estimate of the pounds of potatoes used in the
          dining hall each month.  (10 points.  To get full credit you
          do not need to come close to the actual number.  I'm mainly
          interested in seeing a clear explanation of your logic.  Try
          to do this problem without a calculator -- what sort of nerd
          would bring a calculator with them when visiting a farm?) 
  </ul><p>


  <dd> Chapter 4:   <ol>
            <li>C4B.1. (5 points)
	    <li>C4B.3. (5 points)
	    <li>C4S.2. (5 points)
	    <li>C4S.4. (5 points)
</ol><p>
Chapter 5:
<ol>
	    <li>C5B.1.   (5 points)
	    <li>C5B.4    (5 points)
	    <li>C5B.5    (10 points)
	    <li>C5B.7    (10 points)
	    <li>C5S.2    (10 points)
	    <li>C5S.3    (10 points)
	    <li>***C5A.1 (10 points)  Do this if you want to practice
	    calculus or if you want a challenge.   
    </ol><p>

<dt><b>Homework 3:  Due Friday October 2 at 5PM  </b><p>

Chapter 4:   <ol>
            <li>C4T.8. If false, be sure to say why.  (5 points)
</ol><p>
Chapter 5:
<ol>
	    <li>C5S.6  (15 points)
	    <li>C5S.9  (15 points)

    </ol><p>

Chapter 6:
<ol>
	    <li>C6B.2  (5 points)
	    <li>C6B.5  (5 points)

Chapter 7:
<ol>
	    <li>C7B.4  (5 points)
	    <li>C7B.5  (5 points)
	    <li>C7S.1  (10 points)
	    <li>C7A.1 and C7A.2 are both great calculus problems.  If you're a
	    calculus type, give these a try in your copious spare
	    time.  They're not easy.  See me if you want to work
	    through them together.  (bonus)
