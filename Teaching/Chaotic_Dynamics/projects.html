<br>


<h3>General Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Can take many forms -- need not be a paper.  We will discuss as 
a class whether or not we want to have a set of presentations open to
the coa community, or if we just want to present to the class.
<li>  Should be on some topic that's interesting to you.
<li> You and I share responsibility for the project.  I will try to
meet with you all individually and discuss possible projects.  But you
also need to take some initiative; if you're feeling lost or confused,
be assertive and find me sooner rather than later.
<li>  I strongly encourage you to work on projects in groups.  Perhaps
you'll end up doing separate projects, but maybe a few of you have
broadly similar interests.  If this is the case, I suggest doing some
common background readings and meeting to discuss as a group.

<h3>Preliminary Project Guidelines</h3>
Here are some properties of an excellent final project:
<ol>
<li>Most importantly, you should learn something in the course of
doing your project.  Ideally, you'll find one or two ideas that you'll
want to explore thoroughly.
<li>You should meet all deadlines.
<li>Whatever medium you choose -- talk, paper, etc -- your project 
should be well presented.   You should have a clear audience in mind.  
<li>Your project should be more than a "book" report.  You should do
something.  This might entail building something, writing or
experimenting with computer programs, or doing a bunch of problems.  
<li>Your project should be something you work on over several weeks.
It should not be hastily completed during week 9.
<li>In most cases, you should consult several references, not just
one.  It is also desirable (although in many cases this won't be
feasible) for you to consult a primary reference or two in addition to
texts.  
</ol><p><br>

<h3>Possible Project Ideas</h3>

<ul>

<li>Further exploration of the logistic map.  
<ul>
<li>Detailed proof/demonstration of chaos, 
<li>Examination of universality
<li> Sarkovski's theorem on the ordering of periodic orbits.
</ul>

<li>Measures of randomness and complexity.  How can we quantify how
random or unpredictable a system is?  How can we quantify how
"complex" or "structured" or "complicated" or "intricate" a system is?  

<li> Cellular Automata

<li>Develop lesson plans for a high school or elementary class.  Or,
develop materials for the introductory chaos and fractals course to be
taught in the winter.  

<li>Fractals
<ul>
<li>Detailed exploration of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.  This could
involve doing some graphical experiments and/or proving some stuff.
<li>Applications of fractals in the geosciences.  Looking at the type
of networks formed by river basins might be especially timely, given
that there's a "monster" course in rivers coming up.
</ul>

<li>Evolution and Adaptation
<ul>
<li>Dynamical models of of evolution.
<li>Genetic algorithms.
<li>Evolving cellular automata.  (Our book has a section on this.)
<li>Population Dynamics.  Effects of finite size populations.
</ul>

<li>Models of Ecosystems
<ul>
<li>Predator-Prey
<li>Agent-based models
</ul>

<li>Focus on a particular application.  Dynamics arises in tons of
scientific (and unscientific) situations.  

<li> Do an experiment.  Collect some data.  Or, work with some data
sets that are publicly available.  Build and analyze a chaotic system.

<li>Scaling in biological systems.  Why does metabolism rate depend on
the mass of a creature in the way that it does?

<li>Differential Equations.  There are tons of systems that are
modeled via differential equations.
<ul>
<li>Population dynamics
<li>Mechanical systems (pendulums and springs and stuff)
<li>Chemical reactions
</ul>

<li>Agent-based simulations

<li>Game theory

</ul>
