<ol>
<li>  Simple, deterministic systems can produce random
behavior.  Example:  logistic equation.<p> 

<li> Complicated, large systems can have relatively simple dynamics.
Example:  Random boolean networks with K=2 have only sqrt(N)
attractors. <p>

<li>Fractals can be produced by deterministic and stochastic systems.
Examples: making snowflakes via a deterministic rule; flipping
coins to build a Sierpinsky triangle. <p> 

<li>Mathematical models are sometimes not used for prediction, but
instead to gain a qualitative feel for a system.  <p>

<li> Universality.  Some features of dynamical systems are universal.
These features as quantitatively the same for lots of different
dynamical systems and can (and have) been measured experimentally. <p> 

<li>The mathematics of dynamical systems comes in many different
forms, flavors, and styles.<p>
