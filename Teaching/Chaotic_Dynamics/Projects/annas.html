Bioinformatics is the amazing world where technology, computer
programs, and algorithms come together to help research scientists
obtain information from other sources and to compare data.  One of the
models that bioinformatics programs use is the Hidden Markov Model to
analyze data.  The Hidden Markov Model uses entropy, boolean networks,
and probability to provide information the genetics research
scientist.  It has been broken down by other students into a simpler
"game" model that I would like to express and present to the rest of
my class.  In addition, the chain of how hidden markov models helps
bioinformatics which in turns helps research scientists.
