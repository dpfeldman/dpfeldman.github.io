        There are many complicated patterns created by dynamical
 systems with simple rules and initial conditions. Cellular automata 
 are excellent examples of this phenomenon. They are useful as tools
 and models for facilitating the exploration of the mechanisms that
 drive such complex behavior. They are also not restricted to modeling
 artificial situations but can produce behavior quite similar  to
 natural patterns found in the natural world. Given is a more in depth
 explanation of what defines cellular automata, as well as some
 examples of CA's that model natural patterns.
