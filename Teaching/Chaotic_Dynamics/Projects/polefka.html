An investigation into the phenomena of oscillating chemical reactions,
famously observed and documented by Belousov in the 1950's and
Zhabotinsky in the 1960's, gives insight into non-linear dynamics in
the field of chemistry.  Chemical oscillations result from coupled
reactions that cause changes in concentrations of key reagents through
autocatalytic processes.  Sample reactions, such as the
reduction/oxidation of ferrous sulfate (dye) by ionic bromide and
bromate, are investigated both mathematically and experimentally.
Bulk oscillations in the color of sample solutions are observed, as
well as non-kinetic chemical wave behaviour.  Some basic computational
modeling is attempted.  Applications to bio-chemistry are briefly
investigated, and some gaps in the current understanding of the
phenomena in biological systems discovered.  Finally, a short summary
of the investigation, including observations and research, and some
cool possibilities for future study, are presented.
