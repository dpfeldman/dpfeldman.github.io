Clinicians do not yet have a definite agreement on the course of HIV
infection. However four main stages of disease progression have been
identified. Initial innoculum isthe first stage and refers to when the
virus is first introduced into the body. The initial transient is a
relatively short period -- 2 to 10 weeks -- when there is a great flux
of T cell and virus populations. Clinical latency refers to the steady
state of the disease when there is a significantly large numbers of T
cells and virus undergoing several dynamics. Then there is  the final
stage when the population of T cells nears zero and the virus grows
with little or no bound. This final stage will be the focus in this
paper. It is what is known to many of us as AIDS. <p> 

I'll look at current mathematical models that attempt to explain the
viral/immune system dynamics. By understanding such models, one can
appreciate their use in determining appropriate drug therpaies for HIV
patients. Of particular interest will be the subject of combination
therapy: what we have, how it works, and the potential of this form
of therapy as a true cure for AIDS.
