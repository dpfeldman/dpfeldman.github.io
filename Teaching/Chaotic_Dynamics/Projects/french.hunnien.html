This project is directed towards an audience of varying mathematical 
ability.  The focus of this project is to present an image or educational 
exhibit that conveys fractals to individuals of any age.  The exhibit 
consists of two educational posters:  a historical representation of 
fractals and their recent birth into the mathematical world, and a visual 
collage comprised of several computer generated images of fractals found 
both in nature and through technology.  Brief equations illustrating the 
self-similar nature of fractals and their computation on varied
mathematical levels are represented as well.  The fractal tree is a
visual representation of a concept that is often limited to the
confines of a computer screen.  Thus, a three dimensional fractal tree
brings that which has been inaccessible to the those who lack
mathematical expertise to the forefront.
