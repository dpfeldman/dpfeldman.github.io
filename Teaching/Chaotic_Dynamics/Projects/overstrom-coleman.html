A genetic algorithm is difficult to define, but as Mitchell (1996),
points out they usually have these elements in common: populations,
selection, crossing-over, and mutation.  Recently genetic algorithms
(GAs) have become a successful tool used in multiple scientific
analysis and various types of problem solving.  GAs have been used in
everything from models of economic development, to models of
ecological phenomenon, to the study evolution and population genetics.
It is the final category which this paper attempts to describe.
Specifically Royal Road GAs will be discussed in respect to their
relationship to evolution theory.  The outcomes of these GAs is
dependent upon the parameters introduced to it; genetic, population,
and selection modifiers.  The effects of these modifiers upon Royal
Road GAs will be explored.
