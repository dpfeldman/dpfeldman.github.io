For my project I will have a poster and do a talk.  The poster is
going to have three or four color print-outs comparing some
two-dimensional majority rule CAs to some pictures (maybe water
droplets, etc.) that will help me to explain whta the patterns may
mean (i.e., if it looks like there is surface tension in the CA as in
water, then it may be saying something about the dynamics of the
CA--maybe there is tension at the edges of groups in the majority rule
model?).  On this poster, I will describe some rudimentary aspects of 
what a CA is, mostly what a 2-d CA is and include some text about 
the pattern analysis.     

For the talk I would like to begin with a very brief introduction to
2-d CAs and then move into the basics of what majority rule CAs are
all about and then mostly talk about different patterns and rules
within this category and what they may mean.
