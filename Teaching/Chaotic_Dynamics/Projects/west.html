I will be doing both a poster presentation and an oral presentation.
I will be presenting massively parallel, decentralized systems that I
created using the StarLogoT programming language.  StarLogoT allows
the user to create computer simulations of complex agent based systems
in which all agents operate simultaneously.  Simulations that will be
presented will include the spread of the AIDS virus, an ecological
interaction between species and various breeds of species, and a
simulation of traffic patterns.  I will also discuss the educational
applications of StarLogoT and the value of teaching students about
decentralized systems.
