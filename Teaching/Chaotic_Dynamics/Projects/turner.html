For my project, I will design a method of instruction to teach
fractals to high school students, examine how to incorporate fractal
concepts into the content and instruction of literature and writing
(in high school or elsewhere), analyze the ways that fractal concepts
can be translated to the act of writing, and write sample fractal
poetry.  Through a poster and presentation, I will explain and show
examples of my high school curriculum and activities as well as
fractal writing.
