To have constructive conversations about the world's energy
  options, one needs to take a calm look at the numbers.... If the
  world is to move to a sustainable energy future, one that also
  limits the risk of global warming, each country will need to work
  out its own post-fossil-fuel energy plan. And the numbers will have
  to add up.... Countries [and states, towns, colleges, and
  individuals] that claim to be serious about creating an alternative
  energy future need to choose a plan, stop arguing and get
  building.<br>  <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/">David

<h3>Course Goals</h3><br>

<p class="no-box">
<ol>
  <li>Gain a solid understanding of the basic physics of energy and the
  science behind various energy technologies.
  <li>Gain skills and experience performing and communicating
 quantitative analyses of energy generation and consumption. 
</ol>
<p class="no-box">
Some specific topic areas, skills, and habits of mind to be emphasized
include:<br> 
<ol>
  <li>Students will develop a set of benchmarks so as to have an
  intuitive feel for energy consumption, from the individual to the
  global. 
  <li>Numbers not adjectives!  An energy plan has to add up.  
  <li>The emphasis will be on sustainable energy solutions that scale
  up.  The energy problem is a big one, and so solutions need to be
  big. 
  <li>Students will gain skills and experience using spreadsheets to
  perform and present quantitative analyses.
  <li>Students will also learn how to do basic but important financial
  calculations. 
</ol>

The main text for this course will be David MacKay's Sustainable
Energy &mdash; Without the Hot Air.  This book is available in hard
copy and for free online
at:  <a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/">http://www.withouthotair</a>.
It's an awesome book.

<h3>Official Description</h3>


<br>
<p class="no-box">
The aim of this course is to help students learn some basic physics
and quantitative and analytical skills so that they can participate
intelligently and responsibly in policy discussion, personal and
community decisions, and ventures in the area of sustainable energy.
We will begin with some basic physics: the definition of energy, the
difference between energy and power, and so on.  We will also provide
students with a basic scientific and economic introduction to various
alternative energy technologies.  Along the way, students will gain
mathematical skills in estimation and dimensional analysis, and will
learn to use spreadsheets to assist in calculations.  There will also
be a weekly lab to help students understand the physical principles
behind different energy technologies and gain experience gathering and
analyzing data.  

<p class="no-box">
Students who successfully complete this course will be able to apply
what they have learned to basic issues in sustainable energy. For
example, they will be able to evaluate and analyze a proposed
technology improvement by considering its dollar cost, carbon
reduction, return to investment, payback time, and how all this might
depend on, say, interest rates or the cost of electricity or gasoline.
Students will also be able to analyze the potential of a technology or
energy source to scale up. E.g., they will be able to consider not
only the benefits to a homeowner of a solar installation, but to also
analyze the degree to which wind power may contribute to Maine's
energy needs.

<p class="no-box">
This will be a demanding, but introductory, class.  Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, participation in class and lab, and a
final project.  At least one college-level class in mathematics or
physical science is strongly recommended.   *QR* *ES*  Permission of
instructor.  Class limit of 20.  Lab fee $50.00

<h3>Hours of Academic Engagement</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">

You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically engaged hours
associated with this one-credit course.  These 150 hours will be spent
as follows:  3 hr/wk in class, 3 hr/wk in lab, 1 hr/wk preparing for
class disucsions, 3hr/wk on homework assignments, 4 hr/wk on final
project, and a total of 10 hrs on field trips.
