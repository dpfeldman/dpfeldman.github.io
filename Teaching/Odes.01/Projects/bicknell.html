pace will effect the wetness of a person in a rainstorm.

When caught in the rain many people have a tendency to run quickly to
get undercover.  Is this really the way to stay dry?  If you walk, you
will be soaked by the rain that is hitting the top of your head; if
you run, will you not also be hit by the rain that you yourself run
into?  The purpose of this project is to  present  a number of
different mathematical models in poster form that try to answer this
question, taking into account different variables such as the shape of
the person, and the angle at which the rain is coming at the poor
runner/walker.
