<pre>
This is an attempt to model the worlds human population using differential 
equations.  Two assumptions are made: change in population depends only 
on the rate of increase of the population and the carrying capacity of 
the population depends on the rate of increase of  the population, i.e
	
	dP(t)/dt = r x P(t) x [K(t)-P(t)].
	
	dK(t)/dt = c x dP(t)/dt

where K(t), is the equation for the carrying capacity and P(t), is the 
equation for the population size.  r and c are constants of proportionality.
