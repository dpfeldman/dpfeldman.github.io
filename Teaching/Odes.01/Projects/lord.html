<br>

In this presentation, I explore tow applications of the Schrodinger
equation: the "free particle," the "particle-in-a-box." These 
applications demonstrate some aspects of quantum mechanics using
differential-equation techniques we have studied throughout the 
term. I will show how the Schrodinger equation and differential 
equations can be used to model and study topics in physical
chemistry.
