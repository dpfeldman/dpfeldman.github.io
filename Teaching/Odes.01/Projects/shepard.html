My project is analyisis on a study conducted to find an adequeted
model which describes stream fish diffusion. In combination of actual
data and partial differential equations they were able to come up with
a model that similated diffusion fairly well. There model was also
able to take in to account letptokurtosis, which is movement
distribution with unequal variences.
