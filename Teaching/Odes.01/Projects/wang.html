The flu, an  acute respiratory disease, causes an average of
114,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths per year in the
US. Although the spread of Flu over time can be a matter of considerable
practical importance, with increasing migration among big cities, the
spread of flu in space has also become a great concern. <p>

In this study, I will present a simplified mathematical flu model
developed in USSR and take a close look at how migration affects the
geographical spread of flu.
