Abstract:  The calculus of variations is a method of finding the
function of a curve line or surface that is an optima (maximum or
minimum).  Often the optimal function or curve is a solution to a
differential equation, found through the methods of calculus of
variations. Applications include problems in economics, general
relativity and quantum mechanics. 
The final product of this project is a poster including a basic
explanation of this little-known branch of mathematics. In addition, a
supplementary folder of example applications is available for a
further look at the explored methods.
