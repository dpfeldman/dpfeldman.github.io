Recognition and examination of some of the fundamental mathematical
properties present in the familiar structure of the molluscan shell
can be traced as far back as Aristotle. In recent decades, thanks
largely to the development of computers,  a much more thorough
understanding of the "algorhithmic beauty" of both shell shape and
color has been obtained. This project will demonstrate how
differential equations can be utilized to translate a two dimensional
representation of mollusc shell shape  (i.e. the equiangular or
logarhithmic spiral) into realistic 3-D models with the help of a
computer program. This project will also provide a relatively brief
discussion of how differential equations are used to describe the
chemical interactions thought to produce certain characteristic
molluscan pigmentation patterns.
