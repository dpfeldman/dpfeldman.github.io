<br>

This project focuses on creating a model to determine the optimal sex
ratio, or Evolutionary Stable Strategy, in a population that has the
ability to change its sex dependent on different biological and
environmental cues.  With specific attention towards a single family
of fishes, their specific circumstances will be incorporated into a
general model which may or may not work realistically.  However, the
development of such a model is helpful to the process of understanding
a complex system.
