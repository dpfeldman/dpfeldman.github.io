This project deals with the use of reaction-diffusion equations in
creating a mathematical model for animal coat patterns.  
Stripes, spots, and patches are generated through chemical reactions
in the embryonic stage; by translating these reactions in mathematical
terms -- through reaction-diffusion equations -- we can study them and 
 predict the various outcomes. We then compare these outcomes (which 
depend on a number of parameters) to real patterns from real animals 
-- such as zebras, giraffes, tigers, and the elusive spotted 
Snuffleupagus -- to determine the validity of the model.
