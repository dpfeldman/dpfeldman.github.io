  <td> Thursday, April 5</td>
  <td> Section 1.1.  Section 1.2, only up to p. 27.
  <td>  In class, I'd like to first go over the logistic model,
  pp. 8-10.  If you have questions on the material before p. 8, be
  ready to ask questions on them.  If there aren't questions, we'll
  begin with the logistic model.   This model is important; it will
  come up again and again.  We'll then spend a while discussing
  predator-prey systems, pp. 11-12. <p>

  Section 1.2 is more technical and, perhaps, less interesting than
  1.1.  Try to keep sight of the forest.  Don't get lost in the trees
  of all the algebraic stuff.

  <td> 	Finish section 1.2.  Feel free to skip the "Savings Model" section.
	Read all of 1.3, but skip the RC Circuit section, pp. 43-45.
 </td>
  <td> The sections we're skipping aren't difficult, but cover
  applications that I suspect will be of little interest or relevance
  to many of you. 
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td> 4 </td>
  <td> Thursday, April 12   </td>
  <td> Section 1.4.  Skip "A Nonautonomous Example" and "An RC Circuit
  with Periodic Input".  <p>
  Section 1.5.  All.  </td>
  <td> Section 1.4 is, I think, straightforward and perhaps a little
  tedious.  The key thing is to understand what Euler's method is and
  how it works.  We'll then do an example in class, and talk some
  about when and when not to trust numerical work.  <p>
  I expect to spend the bulk of classtime discussing and pondering
  Section 1.5.   This might be difficult reading; it's the most
  theoretical stuff we've done so far, and thus has a different flavor
  than the previous readings.  Give it a try, but if it doesn't make
  perfect sense, don't panic.</td>
