<p>
<br>

<h4>Overview</h4>

The final project should be an in-depth exploration of a particular
application of differential equations.  alternatively, you can
work on thoroughly understanding a particular method of solution,
numerical or analytic.  In your project you should strive for depth;
avoid doing a broad survey.  You should also <i>do something</i>, as
opposed to merely reading about stuff.<p>

<br>
<h4>Initial pre-presentation</h4>
Approximately week five (we'll set the date later), you will give an
initial presentation in which you introduce your topic.  You
should give a sense of what you'll be doing the next several weeks and
the questions you'll wish to address.  There are several goals for
this initial presentation.
<ol>
<li>Force you to choose a topic early rather than later.
<li>Let other people in the class know what you're up to; get feedback
and ideas from others.
<li>Give you a chance to practice giving technical presentations.
You'll get feedback on your presentation from both me and classmates.
</ol>

Since the pre-presentation is intended for people in the class, it
will likely be rather technical.  Presentations will be around 10-15
minutes.  You should use overhead transparencies.  Powerpoint is
strongly discouraged.<p>

We will probably schedule an evening session so we can have all
the presentations on the same day.  We will also probably not meet
during the classtime before the day of pre-presentations.<p>

<br>

<h4>Final Presentations</h4>

Sometime during week 10 we will give presentations in a session open to
the community.  This will probably be Monday of week 10.  In a few weeks
we will decide on a format.  The session will involve some combination
of talks, posters, and papers. <p><br>
