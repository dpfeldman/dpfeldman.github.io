<h3>What Math Courses are Offered and When?</h3>

<p><a name="Q1"></a>
My teaching schedule is <a href="./future.courses.html">here</a>.  You
can also see a list of anticipated courses for the next several terms
on your CAMS portal (if you're a current COA student or advisor), or
on the <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/registrar">registrar's page</a>. </p>

<h3>How can I learn about the different math and physics classes
offered?</a></h3> 

<p>
In addition to this FAQ, you can look at the list of <a
href"./old.courses.html">past courses</a> that I've taught.  Here
you'll find links to the web pages for every class and tutorial I've
taught at COA.  These web pages often include an informal description
of the class, as well as all assignments and (usually) a detailed
syllabus.  You can also, of course, ask me about classes.  Drop me an
email or something.</p>

<h3>When are Calculus and Physics Offered?</h3>

<p>
Calculus I and II are offered in even years: 
2018-19, 2020-21, etc.  Calculus is <b>not</b> offered in odd 
years. There is no class limit for Calculus I and II.
Everyone who registers will be able to take the course.  The class
might be large, but I've taught big Calc classes before and it's
worked just fine.  There will be plenty of tutors available to help on
the homework.</p>

<p>
Physics I and II are offered at least every other year.  Physics I
 will be offered in Spring 2018 and Physics II will be offered
 sometime in 2018-19.  Physics I and II will likely both be taught
 in 2019-20.</p>

<p>
<b>Please plan accordingly.</b>  Note that two terms
of Physics are required by almost all graduate biology programs, as
well as medical and veterinary schools.  Calculus is also required by
economics, architecture, biology graduate schools, and some other
social science graduate programs.  Most med and vet schools expect
one year of calculus and/or statistics.  </p>

<h3>What's the deal with the Quantitative Reasoning Requirement?</h3>  

<p>All students who enter COA with 9 credits or fewer are required to
take at least one QR course in order to graduate. QR courses include,
but are not limited to, math courses. Most physics classes and some
chemistry and economics classes meet the QR requirement.</p> 

<p>Many students delay taking a QR course.  This is
certainly understandable.  However, there are some reasons why I think
it's better to take a QR course sooner rather than later: With a solid
math and quantitative reasoning background, students will get much
more out of some classes, especially science and economics classes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there may be many other courses that make more
sense for you to take, depending on what you're trying to get out of
COA.  It's usually better to wait and take a math class that is better
suited for you than to take a math class right away that isn't a good
match.  Students sometimes worry that the longer they wait to take a
QR course the harder it will be.  In my experience, this isn't the
case.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that I don't really care when you take a QR
  course.  However, you can box yourself into a corner if you want too
  long and might end up having to take a course that isn't a good
  match for you.

<h3>Do AP credits or an IB in mathematics fulfill the Quantitative

<p>AP credits or IB credits do not fulfill the QR requirement.  Many
</a><a href="#Q7">transfer credits</a> do count, however.  
</p>

<a name="Q2.75"></a>
<h3>Do any non-math classes fulfill the Quantitative Reasoning
Requirement?</h3> 

<p>Yes. Physics I, II, Chemistry II, various statistics classes,
  Wildlife Ecology, Biomechanics, several economics classes, and most
  advanced Chemistry classes 
all meet the QR requirement.  Intro to Chaos and Fractals, an
interdisciplinary class that combines math with lots of other things,
also meets the requirement.  
</p>

<!--<a name="Q3"></a>
<h3>What Math is Needed for Other Classes?</h3> 


<p>The short answer is that it depends.  Ask the teacher of
the class you're interested in taking.  This is just a very rough
guide.</p>

<p><b>Biology I and II</b> require some familiarity with
algebra, functions and interpreting graphs.
  For more detailed information about the math
needed for biology study, consult one of the faculty members in
biology.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><b>Ecology</b> (Instructor: John Anderson) and <b>Evolution and
Ecology</b> (Instructor: Chris Petersen) both require a
firm understanding of algebra.  Students with a weak algebra
background might have difficulty with these courses. </p>
-->


<!--<p><b>Intro to Chemistry II</b> and <b>Physics I and II</b>
make extensive use of algebra.  Physics I also uses some basic
trigonometry.  Chemistry I uses algebra, but much less heavily than
Chem II.  Students who do not have a reasonably firm command of
algebra and/or students who have difficulty applying math to concrete 
problems may have difficulty with some of the math used in these
courses.  
-->

<!--
At a minimum,
these students should be aware that some of the math used in
chemistry, and physics may be difficult for them and that some review
or extra work may be required.  On the other hand, many students have
found that taking chemistry and/or physics is a great way to review
algebra and problem solving.  In these classes there are always
student tutors available to assist students who need it.
</p>
-->

<!--<p><b>Biomechanics</b>  Prerequisites:
One college level course in Biology and one college level course in
Math or Physics, or consent of the instructor.  Biomechanics makes
extensive use of algebra. </p>

<p><b>Introduction to Statistics and Research Design</b> and
<b>Introduction to Probability and Statistics</b>
Prerequisites:  A reasonably solid algebra background. </p>

<p>(Back to <a href="#Top">Top</a>)
</p><br>
-->

<!-- ****************************************************************** -->
<a name="Q3.5"></a>
<h3>What math is needed for graduate school?</h3>

<p>This depends, of course, on what sort of graduate
school you're interested in.  I believe that almost all science grad
schools as well as medical and veterinary schools require two terms of
calculus. These programs also usually require at least two terms of
  physics. 
Some social science/economics programs probably also require some
calculus and also a term or two of statistics.  For a more definitive
answer, you should consult the grad school(s) you're interested in.
Most graduate programs list admissions requirements on their
website.  The requirements for admission into graduate programs often
  have a little flexibility.  There is much less flexibility in the
  requirements for medical or veterinary school.
 Depending on the sort of economics program you're interested
in, you may also need some additional advanced classes, such as
Calculus III, Linear Algebra, or computer programming.  If you're
considering physics, engineering, or mathematics, you'll needs
quite a bit of math.  We should talk.</p>

<p>In many fields having additional math courses beyond what is
required can strengthen your application to graduate school.  More
importantly, you can apply math or programming skills to the research
questions you're interested in.</p>

<p>That said, "because I need it for graduate school" is probably not
  a good reason to take a math class during your first year.  Don't
  worry about grad school requirements now.  Take challenging and
  inspiring and fun classes and worry about grad school later. </p>

<h3>Who should take Introduction to Chaos and Fractals?</h3>

<p>
This course is designed for students who are not ready for or don't
want to take Calculus or Physics, but who need a QR and/or an ES
course, and/or want to learn some interesting and fun math.  It is not
a systematic review of algebra and is not specifically designed to
prepare students for further study in the sciences or mathematics.
This class is highly interdisciplinary and emphasizes connections
among chaos, fractals, and many different fields of study.  Students
who need a more thorough or systematic review of algebra are 
encouraged to take Physics I or Chemistry II.  Intro to Chaos and
Fractals is probably the least traditional QR class regularly
offered at COA.</p>

<h3>What's the deal with The Physics and Math of Sustainable
  Energy?</h3> 

<p>This is a demanding introductory course designed to help students
  learn to do mathematical calculations and understand enough basic
  physics so that they can participate effectively and responsibly in
  discussions of sustainable energy and efforts to reduce greenhouse
  gas emissions. You'll learn some physics and learn a bit about how
  various energy generating and consuming technologies work.  We also
  cover basic financial mathematics, a topic that students expect to
  find dull but usually end up really enjoying.  Taking this course is
  strongly recommended for students wishing to participate in
  project-based renewable energy courses. This course is also a good
  match for those interested in sustainable business, climate change
  politics, and farming and agricultural policy.  The class will be
  offered in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018.</p>

<h3>Do math courses taken at other colleges fulfill the QR
requirement?</h3> 

<p>In general, yes, non-remedial math classes at other college can
  meet COA's QR requirement.  But to be sure, you should check with me
  and/or the 
college registrar.  Taking a course at another college is a good 
option for some students, especially those who are having a difficult
time fitting all the COA requirements into their schedule and/or who
might rather take their math at a less expensive college.  </p>

<!-- ****************************************************************** -->
<a name="Q7.5"></a>
<h3>Can I place out of the QR requirement?</h3>

<p>No.  Regardless of whatever math you've had before you came here,you
need to take one QR course while at COA (unless you're a transfer
student.)  The idea is that all students, as part of their
interdisciplinary B.A. in human ecology, should take at least one
course that requires quantitative reasoning or symbolic thinking.

<h3>Should I take Calculus?  Am I ready for Calculus?  Do I need to
take Calculus?</h3> 

<p>Here are some things to consider as you're contemplating whether or
not to take calculus. </p>

<p>Many students who are good at and/or like math feel they
are ``supposed to'' take calculus.  High school math curriculum is
  very centered on getting students to reach calculus, so calculus is
  seen as a goal or a pinnacle.  (I don't think
  this is a great idea, but that's another conversation.)
Perhaps their parents or siblings
took calculus in college, or maybe they want the challenge, or maybe
they just feel it's next in line.  For many of these students,
calculus is indeed an appropriate and fun course.  Calculus is an
  incredibly powerful and flexible set of tools and ideas that are
  used through the mathematical sciences and which help to solidify
  and synthesize a great deal of mathematics.
However, statistics
is another option.  Statistics is, arguably, more important for many
areas of study than calculus.  And statistics is certainly used more
in other classes at coa than calculus.  So, don't feel like you "have
to" take calculus.  Take it if you want to take it.</p>

<p>Also, calculus is required by many graduate schools.
So, if you're planning on going to grad school in the sciences or even
the social sciences, you'll probably need to take calculus at some
point.  Also, calculus is required for most of advanced math and
  physics classes offered at COA, including:  Differential Equations,
  Thermodynamics, Calculus III, and Linear Algebra.  If you think you
  might be 
interested in advanced physics or math, it's a good idea to take
calculus sooner rather than later. 
And calculus is a great deal of fun.  It has many applications and
it ties together a lot of different things that you learned in
previous algebra classes.</p>

<p><b>Am I ready?</b> If you had a decent algebra and trig course at
some point in your past, you are almost surely ready for calculus.
It's not important that you 
remember  trig identities and the properties of logarithms.
It is important, however, that you've had some practice working with
and thinking with functions: f(x).  Calculus is not a very difficult
course; it is not a huge leap harder than Precalc or algebra and trig.
Many students (myself included) found calculus to be significantly less
difficult than precalculus.  For most, calculus "makes sense" and is a
lot more logical than precalculus or trigonometry.  If the last math
class you took was a long time ago, don't worry.  There are lots of
tutors to help you remember the stuff you might have forgotten.  It
will come back to you quicker than you expect.  My experience has been
  that students who are many years removed from their last math class
  still do just fine in calculus.  
</p>

</p><br>



<!-- ****************************************************************** -->
<a name="Q5"></a>
<h3>I've taken Calculus before, can I start in Calc II? </h3> 

<p>If you had calculus before, I recommend that you not take
calculus I, unless you had a <i>really</i> bad calculus experience.
If your calc experience was in the ok to pretty good range, then you
might consider taking Calc II.  In Calc II we cover techniques of
integration, applications of integration, and sums and series.  We
also do a fair amount of review of derivatives.  If you had a good,
solid calculus experience, then it's probably in your best interest to
skip Calc I and II.  By solid experience, I mean that you felt at the
time like you "got" many of the things you covered in calculus, not
that you remember tons of formulas.  If you had AP Calc (AB or BC) or
  did Higher or Standard math for IB, you almost surely should not
  take Calc I or II. </p>

<p>The above is just a set of guidelines, however.  If you had calc
before, it's probably a good idea to talk with me about what calculus,
if any, you should take at COA.</p>

<a name="Q5.11"></a>
<h3>Am I ready for Calc III? </h3> 

<p>If you have had integral and differential calculus, then you are
probably ready for Calculus III.  If you've forgotten a lot of
calculus, that's ok.  Calc III basically re-does all of calculus 
for functions of more than one variable.  So the course ends up
reviewing lots of Calc I and II.  If you have questions about Calc
III, check out one of the websites from a Calc III course and/or let
me know.

<a name="Q5.5"></a>
<h3>I've taken Physics before.  Should I take Physics I?  What about
Physics II and Biomechanics?</h3>

<p>Physics I covers mechanics: kinematics, forces and Newton's laws,
  conservation of energy and momentum.
If you've had a good physics class before, you probably don't want to
take physics I -- it might not be challenging.  On the other hand, 
you'll probably find that Physics I covers familiar topics in a
different and (hopefully) interesting way.  As such, you might still
be interested in Physics I.</p>

<p>Physics I is an excellent course for students who want to improve
their quantitative problem solving skills and review algebra.  It is
taken by many students as their only QR course.  It's a great way to
get lots of practice solving word problems.  Physics I also serves as
a pre-calc course of sorts; if you're uncertain of your algebra 
and trigonometry, taking Physics I can be a good way to improve your
skills so you have an easier time with Calculus.</p>

<p>Physics II covers electricity, magnetism, and as time permits,
  special relativity.  Physics II makes fairly extensive use of
  algebra.  Physics I is not required.</p>

<p>Biomechanics covers topics that are
almost never taught in high school.  So if you've had Physics before,
you'll definitely learn new stuff in this course.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the different physics options at COA,
please check out the courses' websites and/or let me know.</p>

<h3>What's the deal with Physics III/Quantum Mechanics?</a></h3>

<p>(Note: The quantum mechanics class used to be known as Physics III.)
This course is designed to appeal to both students who
anticipate concentrating in the sciences, as well as those who need a
QR credit and/or who want to learn some really cool stuff about
quantum mechanics.  The focus will be on learning
what's strange about quantum mechanics -- how does quantum mechanics
differ from classical mechanics, the physical theory that describes
how the objects of everyday experience move and interact with each
other?  In addition to this scientific content, the course covers some
of the history and philosophy of quantum mechanics, examining why
quantum mechanics was (and still is) viewed as such a radical shift
from other physical theories.
Physics I and II are not prerequisites for Physics
III.  There is a moderate amount of algebra, but it is less
mathematically demanding than most other physics classes.  In the
past, Physics III has been taken by a wide range of students,
including those focusing in the humanities, and I think almost all
students have found it fun, challenging, and provocative.
<b>Note: I do not anticipate offering Quantum Mechanics in the next
  several years.</b></p>

<h3>What's the deal with the different statistics classes?</h3>

<p>There are two introductory statistics classes offered:
<b>Introduction to Statistics and Research Design</b> taught by Sean
Todd, and <b>Probability and Statistics</b> taught by Chris Petersen.
One of these classes is offered every year.  Both of these courses are
introductory stats classes; they assume little to no prior exposure to
statistics but do make use of algebra.  The courses
cover similar material.  Sean's class is geared slightly more toward
biology, while Chris's class might be a little bit more general.

<p>John Anderson's advanced class, <b>Wildlife Ecology</b>, covers
  research methods and various applications of statistics to ecology.
  This class meets the QR requirement.  Biology I, Biology II, and
  Ecology are pre-requisites. 
</p>

<p>This winter there will be a new intermediate/advanced stats class
  offered by Susan Letcher.  Contact her for details.  I suspect that
  prior coursework in statistics will be a pre-requisite.</p>

<p>Chris, Sean, John Anderson, and I have all offered tutorials and
independent studies on different aspects of intermediate and advanced
statistics.  Talk to one of us if you think you might be
interested.</p>

<h3>What advanced math courses are there?</h3>

<p>There are a number of options, including <b>Differential
    Equations</b>, <b>Linear Algebra</b>, and <b>Calculus III</b>. 
</p>

<p>I also offer tutorials to small groups of motivated students in
intermediate and advanced topics.  If you think you might be
interested in a tutorial, let me know.  From time to time I also do
independent studies or small research projects with advanced
students.

<h3>Is computer programming offered?</h3>

<p>This winter I will teach a new class on scientific programming
  using python.  Students will learn the basics of python.  The class
  will center around a handful of case studies, each of which will
  illustrate one or more important techniques or concepts in
  scientific computing.  This is not a general introduction to
  computer science class.  Calculus and/or statistics would be helpful
  background, but is not required.</p> 

<p>I incorporate python programming in Differential Equations, which
  I expect to next teach in Winter 2019.</p>


<p>There are  many good courses and tutorial available free on line
  that you can use to learn programming.  If you are interested in
  computer science or programming, talk to me and we can discuss options.  
  </p>
<p>We are also about to embark on a search for a new faculty member in
  Computer Science.  If successful, the faculty member will begin
  teaching in Fall 2018.</p>

<h3>I think I need a precalc class, but I don't see a pre-calculus

<p>Are you sure you need a pre-calc class?  You <a href="Q4.75">don't
need</a> to have taken a class called pre-calc to take calculus.  If
you haven't had enough algebra to take calculus, I think the best
thing to do is to take Physics I.  This is probably the best class for
solidifying algebra and learning some basic trigonometry.</p>

<h3>I'm really bad at math, I'm intimidated by
it, or I just plain dislike it.  What should I do?</h3>

<p>My experience has been that almost all COA students who fit this
description are able to find a QR class that works for them.
Introduction to Chaos and Fractals is probably the most basic math
class at COA, in that it relies the least on a prior knowledge of
algebra.  If you're looking for something more concrete, a physics or
chemistry class might be for you.  There are lots of different courses
that meet the QR requirement.  Talk to me or drop me an email and
we'll figure something out</p>

<p>The exams in math and physics classes at COA are untimed and open
notes.  So you don't need to race to finish problems, and you can
consult your notes or the textbook.  I've found that this usually
significantly lessens students' math anxiety.  Almost all math,
physics, and chemistry classes have a least one student teaching
assistant, so there will be plenty of opportunity to get help.</p>

<h3>I really like math and physics.  I want to get a strong background
in these subjects. What should I do?</h3> 

<p>I really like math and physics, too.  And I also really enjoy
computer programming.   There
are a good number of intermediate to advanced classes at COA,
especially in mathematics.  I also am usually able to offer tutorials
if there is an intermediate or advanced topic that a few students want
to learn about. </p>

<p>There are also opportunities off campus.  
Students can also take a term or two at another college as a visiting
student.  In the not-too-distant past, COA students have gone to the
  University of Washington and Smith College to take some advanced
  math classes that aren't offered at COA.  Also, there are lots of
  opportunities to do research internships in the summer.</p> 

<p>The bottom line is that I've found that COA students are able to
get an excellent background in math and quantitative analysis.</p>
