<h3>Lab Policies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Failing to attend labs will negatively affect your course grade and
  evaluation.  Labs are an important (and I hope fun) part of the
  course.  We will learn skills here that you won't get a chance to
  practice in homework or discuss much in class.<p>

  <li>The lab participation portion of your evaluation will be based
  almost exclusively on the degree with which you engage the material
  and the level of cooperation with your lab partners.  I'm not that
  interested in "right" answers.<p>

  <li>Typical labs will be around two hours, but some may be
  longer.<p>

  <li>Be prepared to go outdoors.  We won't go out if it's really
  really yucky, but we might go out in drizzle and cold.<p>

  <li>Lab work will not spawn a significant amount of work beyond the
  two to three hours we spend together.  There will be no lab reports.
  I usually will ask you to complete a worksheet as part of the lab.
  I will also conduct a very informal "exit interview" after you
  complete the lab exercises to make sure that your group has a grasp
  for the ideas covered.<p> 

</ul>
