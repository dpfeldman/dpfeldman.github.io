<h3>Course Overview
</h3>

We will cover some special relativity, using unit R from Tom Moore's
<i>Six Ideas that Shaped Physics</i> series, and some electricity and
magnetism using <i>Electric and Magnetic Interactions</i> by Ruth
Chabay and Bruce Sherwood.  How much of each we cover is for the class
to decide.


I have three main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want to help you to continue to improve your quantitative
literacy, problem solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
<li>I want you to gain a firm understanding of the main ideas of
special relativity, and get a broad introduction to electricity and
magnetism.  
<li>I want you to explore a topic of your choosing in considerable
depth. 
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<!--
Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 55 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/ADMISSIONS/Registrar/CourseCatalog/AcademicPlanning/records.html">page 8</a>
of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br>
-->

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of the course syllabus will be on the course web page.  
<!--<li>Homework will be due Fridays at 8pm.  I will only accept one
    unexcused late assignment. 
<li>I expect you to attend class and labs.
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
    You may not, however, get help from any humans during the exams.
<li>For each class for which I assign reading, you should arrive
    with at least one question or a comment on the reading.  I will often
    use your comments and questions as a starting point for class
    discussion. 
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.
