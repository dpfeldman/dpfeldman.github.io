<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
   <li>  I want you to get a solid foundation in linear algebra which
   you can then apply to areas of your interest. 
  <li> I want you to increase your "mathematical sophistication,"
   ability to reason abstractly, and give you an introduction to some
   of the more formal ideas of mathematics. 
  <li> I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
   solving skills, and mathematical confidence. This includes using
   computers to help you set up and solve problems. 
  <li> I want to have fun while working hard and learning some
  challenging material.  
</ol>


<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p class="no-box"><br>
Introduction to Linear Algebra (fourth edition).  Gilbert Strang.
Wellesley Cambridge Press.  2009.  ISBN:
978-09802327-14.  [<a href="http://tinyurl.com/q8l5t8n">amazon.com</a> |
<a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=9780980232714&sts=t">abe.com</a>] 

<p class="no-box">
We will make heavy use of the videos and other materials available as
part of MIT's OpenCourseware Scholar webiste for
course <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm">18-06</a>.

Other resources:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/index.shtml">Current (Fall
  2013) website for MIT 18.06</a>
</ul>


<h3>Class Format</h3>
<p class="no-box"><br>
This class will be taught in
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching">flipped</a>
  format.  You will watch video lectures before class.  Classtime will
  be devoted to discussion and solving problems.  I have not taught a
  class in this format before, but I am very excited to give it a
  try.  We will need to experiment some and figure out how to
  optimally use class time.  


<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 90 percent.
<li><b>Class Attendance and Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.  But I also
understand that many students believe (perhaps correctly) that grades
will make it easier to get into graduate or professional school.
</p>


<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>



<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  This means they will be of
significantly less use to you on exams.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<!--<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
functions, logs, and scientific notation.  You do not need a graphing
calculator for this course. -->

<li>We will also do some computational work as part of this class.  We
  will discuss in class which platform(s) to use.  I am leaning toward
  python and numpy, but there are other options to consider. 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
    hearing; see the academic handbook for details.  Possible
    consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion.
