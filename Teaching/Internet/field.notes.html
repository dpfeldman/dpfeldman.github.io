<h1 align=center> Field Notes Guidelines</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

These field notes should serve as a report of some of your experiences
online exploring online communities.  Ideally, you'll be reporting on
your experiences with one or two communities over a period of a few
weeks.  If this is not possible, perhaps you can report on one or two
online chat or icq experiences.  (If you're feeling particularly
adventurous, perhaps experiment with different "identities".)



<ul>

<li> Your report should probably be around 3-4 pages types.  You
should be sure to include the following:
<ol>
<li>Description of the "community" you worked in.  Include its name,
URL, who it's targeted for, etc.
<li>A summary of your interactions.  What did you talk about, when,
for how long, with whom.  There's no need to be exhaustive, but you
should give a sense of what goes on in your community.
<li>How is language used -- is there a "local dialect"?
<li>What classes or groupings of people do you observe?  Do male and
female users act similarly?  What, if any, evidence of hierarchies do
you see?
<li>Additional comments:  Do you think the community functions as a
community?  On what basis do you make this judgement?  Did you enjoy
your time in the community?  
</ol><p>

<li>You should <b>participate</b> in the online community, not just
observe silently.<p>

<li>Your report need not be a polished essay.  Rather, it should be in
the style of field notes -- careful, thoughtful observations about 
what you're seeing and participating in.
