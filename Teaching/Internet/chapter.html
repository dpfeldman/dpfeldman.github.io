<h1 align=center> Chapter Presentation Guidelines</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

You and at least one other student will be assigned a chapter from
<i>The Soft Edge</i>.  You and your partner will be in charge of
facilitating discussion on this chapter in class.  I imagine that
we'll spend between ten and fifteen minutes on each chapter.  

To prepare, you and your partner should meet and discuss the following
items:
<ul>
<li>Come up with a short summary of the chapter.  What were the main
points?  
<li>What in the chapter did you agree with, and what did you disagree
with?  
<li>What questions do you have about this chapter that you'd like to
discuss in class?
<li>What relevance, if any, does this chapter have for our study of
the internet?
</ul>
