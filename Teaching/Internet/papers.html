<h1 align=center> Short Response Paper Guidelines</h1><p>
<p>
<br>


Here are some guidelines for the short papers.

<ul>
<li>They should be around two pages in length.
<li>They should be in the style of a well-developed journal entry.  You
do not need to come to any grand conclusion.  It's fine to raise more
questions than you answer.
<li>The audience you should probably have in mind while writing is:
you, me, and the rest of the people in the class.
<li>I strongly recommend writing in the first person.
<li>I'm looking for evidence of critical thought, <i>not a summary of the
reading</i>.  
<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed.  
<li>Explore one or at most two ideas.
<li>Write about something that interests you!  
<li>Your writing should be clear; use "correct" usage.  Grammar and
overall clarity will be part of your evaluation.  The writing can be
quite informal, but should still read ok.
<li>Please hand in your papers on time.  If papers are consistently
late, I'll probably mention this on your narrative evaluation.  If you
need extra time, let me know.  
<li>Feel free to experiment -- both with ideas and with your writing.


</ul>
