<P>	</P>

<P>Throughout history technologies have enabled humans to communicate with each other through
various mediums over vast distances.  This has enhanced our way of living along with our social
structures.  Communication technologies have eroded distances between one another, and because
of this we are becoming more educated about our world and ourselves.  Communication, loosely
defined, is the transfer of information from one person to another, or many.  There are three main
points that I will describe today's newest method of mass communication, the internet.  First, I will
explain what the internet is, how it is different from past technologies and what it can and does do. 
Secondly, I will discuss how a privately owned and controlled internet, will not truly reflect the
essence of democracy.  Finally, in doing so I will explain the functions of businesses within the
modern capitalist system.  Media, has always, and will always, be necessary for communicating
information to the populace.  Information is a human necessity within a democratic society. 
Information, by its nature is a free thing, yet within a capitalist framework it is perceived as a good. 
This is where the problem began and continues.  Democracy survives on open debates and
discussions between individuals sharing information, in order to form a more perfect society. 
Creating media that are privately owned - that is, owned by a person and not a society -  when it is
something that by its nature should be free to all constituents of that society, affects the essence of
democracy.  This is where the internet is heading - like all past media technologies of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century
- to a more privately owned and controlled system.  The internet is multi faceted.  It has many
functions, only a few which are marketable yet the internet has become the machine behind the "new
economy".  The internet is in danger of losing its tag as a communicative/information based
technology, instead the internet will become a market driven privately owned and operated capitalist
institution.  The future is uncertain and unfortunately history repeats itself.  We can only hope that
the internet will bridge the lacking gap of communication and democracy within our current
hypermedia society.  In order for democracy to exist within a society where its essence can be
utilized, this pattern of privatization must end with the internet.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Democracy is nestled in the belief that government should have no centralized power.  That is,
government should not be totalitarian, and should not dictate the laws and consequences of the
people without the peoples consent.  This is why democracy is founded on effective public debate
and the open transference of information and opinions.  In John Dewey's terms, democracy is where
people control their government, because it is theirs to control.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His view was that democracy is not
an end in itself, it's a means by which people discover and extend and manifest their fundamental
human nature and human rights.  These rights are rooted in freedom, solidarity and a choice of both
work and other forms of participation in a social order and free individual existence.<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Democracy
allows the individual to contribute to society through debate, speech, writing, etc.  This allows for
each persons ideas and opinions to be heard and distributed.  The advent of the media in the 1930'
and 1950's which eventually became private, shifted their motives towards a spectator democracy
rather than one of participance.  A spectator democracy - from a media controllers perception -
functions best when they are able to "manufacture consent" from the populace in order to control
political or industrial motives.<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  This shift changed our society in many ways, but the rise of the
internet has arguably been a saving power to this content controlling media.  Our hopes are that this
will remain true.  Media, in its true essence, allows the exchange of these ideas and opinions through
various mediums openly and free from control.  Today, this is not what media has become, rather
it has become exactly what media is not, regulated.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Historically, private control has dominated
media technologies in the US.  The private industry quickly controlled large portions of the radio in
the 1930's as did the television in the 1950's.  Through newer modes of communication, people,
government and groups will be able to discuss and effectively enrich democracy.  But instead, it is
the repeated privatization of these technologies that impede any constructive advancement of
democracy. Today, in a hypermedia society, like the U.S., democracy is best defined "as applied to
organizing our lives together, it means greater popular control over the terms and conditions of that
life, and greater social justice inscribed in those terms."<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Our hypermedia society does exactly the
opposite.  We have no popular control over our media technologies, and because we lack control
over our media, we cannot enrich and advance our lives. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Since media has slipped into the private
sector, the values of democracy that are inherent in its essence are substituted for the capitalist value
of profit.   The modes of capitalism are much different than the modes of democracy.  The private
sector has one primary objective: profit maximization.  It is this single view of the world and the
extremities that the private sector controls, that will lead to the demise of democracy.  Currently both
of these opposing systems are existing together, but one is winning.  Capitalism is that victor. 
Because of their [capitalists] control of a public institution they place a democratic institution within
the narrow framework of capitalism.  This, is clearly against the essence of democracy.  Historically,
media has taken many forms.  It started with the mouth as a version of debate or lecture in a public
setting, print in newspapers and magazines, the radio, where a voice can be received over vast
distances, the television where like the radio a voice can be heard but now that voice can also be
seen.  On the internet one can communicate by letters, print, audio and even video.  All of this is
done instantaneously, where there can even be instantaneous reply and debate.  The internet to some
extent is an electronic version of the soap box, where an individuals computer is their soap box and
the location is the world wide web.  Douglas Rushkoff writes:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Needless to say, the internet is a social anarchy.  There is no governing body for the system.  Scientists share
the network with hobbyists and hacker who share the system with writers, artists, researchers, corporations, and,
of course, activists.  The internet is inherently threatening to anyone in a position of power because no one -
at least not yet - can regulate the tremendous flow of information.  The real observations of millions of people,
shared through the networks, create an undeniable, high resolution portrait of our current state of affairs</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">...</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">By
far the greatest power of the overall computer network is its ability to change public perception.  More than
affecting any particular issue, the net changes the way private citizens perceive their ability to understand and
effect the global system.  Anyone cruising the internet soon learns that from his own laptop he has the ability
to reach into anything from the Library of congress or a database in Tel Aviv to an activist's alert or the White
House archives.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This picture of the internet as a extension of an informed citizenry - while exaggerated some -
describes what the internet can do and has done for communication in the world, or at least the rich
world.  The internet will allow communication between workgroups, but more importantly it will
merge people from all schools of thought, and selected disciplines.  This information melting pot -
as opposed to a racial one - is where the internet becomes the engine behind democracy.  The internet
effectively pushes and energizes a democratic society.  Where the radio and tv have failed, there is
a good outlook for the future of the internet remaining as a public tool.  This is the essence of the
internet. The internet has been highly regarded as the saving technology that will allow users to
become a more informed citizen. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Democracy is not about voting for our leaders Democracy is about
citizens who have the communication they need to govern themselves...The more we know about
the kind of literacy citizens are granted by the internet, the better our chances of using that literacy
to strengthen democracy."<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The user will be able to actively communicate with people(s) over vast
distances allowing debate.  The internet began as user directed technology, but now with programs
like web browsers and "portals" is more company directed.  For instance, if AOL, the country's
largest internet service provider, makes a deal with Amazon.com that AOL will link to
Amazon.com's website for royalties on any sale coming from the AOL link, one can clearly see the
role of capitalism, media and internet privatization.  Chances are that since these programs have
everything already set up chances are people will not navigate off the portal list.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  "Cyberspace itself
is being rapidly colonized by the familiar workings of the market system.  Across their breadth and
depth, computer networks link with existing capitalism to massively broaden the effective reach of
the market place.  Indeed, the internet compromises nothing less than the central production and
control apparatus of an increasingly supranational market system."<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The main problem is that the
internet can and has effectively proven its success in a capitalist framework, while also becoming
a very successful communication tool for gathering and spreading information.  The internet
successfully works in both the capitalist and democratic systems.  Unfortunately, capitalism and
democracy do not.  The ideals and motives of each system cannot exist together, to have one is to
not have the other.  It is no surprise that businesses have always appreciated media because of their
audiences.  It is advertising that links capitalism and media, its that simple.  (This is also very 
connected to the "manufacturing consent" seen earlier)  What better way to advertise than by the 
use of media, since media's intended use is for the masses to consume.  It is in this chimera of media
and advertisement where many detrimental effects on the development of media has taken a turn for
the worse.  Since the amount of subjects to these advertisements was so vast, private industry saw
that the profit maximization from controlling these media technologies would be exponential.  A
capitalists main function within society is to maximize their profits and within a truly free market
system nothing can stop a capitalist from securing a strangle hold on various types of media and
various other avenues of profit maximization.  Luckily, the world has never seen a truly "free
market" economy, and in the hopes of the future of the world we never will.  A free market economy
is free from governmental regulation and social impediments.  This means that within a free market
the capitalist - not the citizen or the consumer - are the kings and they and their system are truly
above the law.  Governmental regulation serves two main purposes:  the prevention of monopolies
and the means to effectively debate current economic proposals within that society.  This, I believe,
creates an open system where both the citizen and the capitalist are in check.  But today businesses
have reached a point where their accumulation of capital has created an entourage of large
oligopolies where democracy is powerless.  Albert Einstein explains:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition
among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing
division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the
smaller ones.  The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital, the
enormous power of <EM>which cannot be effectively checked</EM> even by a democratically organized
political society."<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>(emphasis added)</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Today, unfortunately we are at the doorstep of complete private control of our newest media
technology, the internet. The internet is tightrope walker in a capitalists circus, it is on the cusp of
a market driven, e-commerce role of the internet, versus a public, debate and information oriented
communication technology.  Private control is anti-democratic, public control is democratic.  The
path we choose to take will forever be reverberated throughout our society for years to come.  It is
today and tomorrow where decisions will be made on the future of social control or private control
of the internet; it is here on the internet where we must articulate our desires and concerns. 
Expression and ideas from individuals within society are what make democracy; if the internet
becomes privatized our hopes for the internet as the saving technology are lost.
