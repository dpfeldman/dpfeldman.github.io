<h1>Internet Manifesto</h1>
<h3>Jenny George</h3>




	The Internet is a radical new territory where gender
identity is fluid and flexible; it is an arena where we can play
with our gender identity, actually be another gender and have
gendered encounters unlike anything we have in the real world
(where we are bound by our physical bodies). The Internet is a
radical new territory where we have ultimate control over how
others perceive us, right down to our gender identities. The
Internet is a radical new territory because it is essence
genderless- an uncharted space where persons are unmarked when it
comes to gender. All these claims- and many more in similar
veins- have been made about the Internet in the past decade. It
seems to me that each of the claims about gender identity on-line
has some truth to it, but each is also arguable or exaggerated to
some degree. Yes, the Internet provides us with a new space in
which gender can be articulated, but it may not be all that
radical. I believe that the most useful part of the discussion
about on-line gender comes from reflection back onto the real
world: how we talk about the construction of gender on-line
exposes the construction of it in everyday life. <p>

	Early in the 90's, when the Internet was first starting to
come into homes and common life, feminists began making hopeful
speculations about the Internet's radical potential to equalize;
it represents a gender-neutra1 space, some people claimed, where
gender won't have to be so central. Pure information and pure
communication should be able to occur on-line, without the
troubling power dynamics associated with gender. I remember
hearing predictions like this when I was in high school and chat
rooms were just coming into widespread popularity. Over the past
few years, though, this rhetoric has dropped significantly out of
sight as it has become clear just how gender is articulated on
the Internet. Today, gender is a huge focus of the Internet-
especially in chat rooms, on-line role-playing games, and
personal home pages. Users have many, many ways to mark their
gender, from language use and gendered social or cultural
references to just saying it out right; it is as if we can't
really function in relation to one another without some sense of
everyone's gender identity. We have strong social training to
expect a person's gender to be clear when we interact with them
(I'm thinking of my mother at a restaurant in Provincetown,
asking me in a whisper about our bespangled waiter: "Is that a
man or a woman?"); this expectation carries over to the Internet.
Often one of the first questions you'll be asked when you enter a
chat room is: "Are you a man or a woman?" Followed by: "How old
are you?" And: "Where are you from?" The on-line forums used for
intimate encounters like singles conversations and cybersex are
especially rife with such queries.<p>


	The farther you get from personal chat rooms, though, the
less attention to gender there is. There certainly are parts of
the Internet that allow for gender anonymity or for relatively
ungendered encounters. E-mail, for instance, is a way to ask a
question or make contact with another person without having to
mark yourself as a man or woman. If I wanted to ask a company
about job or internship opportunities, I could e-mail my request
and keep a neutral username identity; a phone call would likely
reveal my gender through the sound of my voice. Also, message
boards that are organized around a specific principle, like
Noah's photography critique group, tend not to be nearly as
gender-focused as the public chat rooms. The Internet is also
hugely commercial; certainly a site like amazon.com does not
require you to identify publicly with any gender- they just want
you to shop there. Still, the original claims that the Internet
would revolutionize our attitudes about gender have not really
been actualized. It is not a pure or neutral space where all
genders have equal access to a single, ungendered discourse; it
is not a space where all genders have the same experience.
Gender identity remains a troubling issue, just as it still is in
the real world. And so the claims have changed; the Internet is
no longer radical because it will wipe the gender slate clean;
now the Internet is said to be radical because it is a space
where anyone can be anything- male, female, both, neither.<p>


	This may be an off-hand thing to say these days: "you know,
on the Internet you can be either male or female.. ." but it is
actually a very powerful statement about gender construction and
performativity, a statement that is deeply informed by postmodern
and feminist thought. I'm not sure that people really know what
assumptions they are embracing or overthrowing when they make
such bold and important claims, when, for instance, John Suler
writes: "you can alter your style of being... change your age,
physical appearance, even your gender."[1]  The first idea that
such a statement critiques- even dismantles- is a fundamental
one: the idea that gender and biological sex are the same thing.
There has long been the assumption that sex, gender, and
sexuality line up (or should line up) in each person. But in
fact, gender is a social phenomenon; a person with male sex
organs may not identify socially with the male gender, and the
same may be true for a biological woman- she may not identify
with the female gender. Gender and sex are not unrelated, but
neither are they correlated exactly with each other all the time;
a person is not locked into a particular gender by his or her
biology. Therefore, a person may have some control over gender,
may be able to play with it- both on-line and off. <p>

	The second idea- and the more tricky one- contained in the
much used sentiment "you can be any gender you want on the
Internet. .." is the idea that gender is a performed identity, and
that the act of performance is not just a masquerade- a costume
over a "real" gender- but the performance is itself the
gendering. It is certainly true that you can pretend to be any
gender you choose on the Internet; you can say "I'm a woman," or
"I'm a man," to other people on-line. But does this mean that
you actually are the gender that you claim to be, for the time
that you claim it? When John Suler or the like says that a
person can "be any gender," he is employing the idea that gender
is a site of inextricable performance-and-construction. He is
saying that by acting the gender, you become it.<p>

	Partly, I agree with this. Gender is a performance in the
real world just as much as it is on the Internet. I am a woman
to the extent that I play the part of a woman and am treated as
one in social interactions; how I walk, speak, dress, sit, and so
on, how I come across in this society is what marks me as a
woman, even though there is no one exact way to be feminine.
There is, in fact, a very complex range of gender codes that
everyone uses and manipulates to some degree in the construction
of gender. On the Internet, there is also a set of codes, often
overlapping with the real world, which people employ and enact
when gendering themselves.<p>

	Partly, however, I am troubled by the idea that simply
getting on-line and calling yourself a man or a woman makes you
one or the other. A "man" and a "woman" are both extremely
complicated social beings... shouldn't it take something more
than a proclamation to become one?<p>

	The casual rhetoric surrounding on-line gender identity
sometimes makes me uncomfortable. Shannon NcRae quotes the man
who "becomes" a woman on Internet role-playing games and has
cybersexual encounters with a male player: "When you're [a woman]
getting fucked by a man there's this amazing thing..."[2]. To me
this seems over the top, despite my belief in gender
performativity. Yes, gender is fluid and changeable, but it's
not simple. If you want to play Romeo believably and effectively
on stage, you don't just get up there and say "Hey, I'm Romeo!"
You have to truly act the part of Romeo- speech, costumes,
emotion, etc. Other people have to see you and believe in your
interpretation of the concept of Romeo before you can say that
you have really experienced the part.<p>

	The same goes for gender identity, I believe. Gender is not
simply a performance; it is a performance with consequences. It
is a performance that must occur in a greater, socio-cultural
setting, in response to others; male and female are only
meaningful categories in relation to each other and to culture
and history. I think that "experimenting" and playing around
with your gender identity on-line is a positive thing, but I
don't know if it is as radical as some people would have it be.
Calling yourself a woman in an on-line role-playing setting is
certainly not as strong a political statement or as disruptive of
cultural conditioning as dressing in drag and walking around the
real world. The severe anonymity of the Internet allows for
general, social experimentation, but it also limits the extent to
which gender identities can be deeply actualized.<p>

	The disembodied nature of the Internet is another reason
off-hand claims such as Suler's or McRae's make me wary. Gender
is divorced from biological sex, but it is still rooted in
physicality. Our physical bodies are the sites of gender
performativity and construction; they are where the idea of
gender gets realized and enacted. What does it mean then when a
man sits at his computer, in his male-gendered body, and acts as
a woman on-line? Where is the female body in this situation?
Has it become unnecessary? idealized into text? It seems to me
that the trouble our bodies cause us in the real world- their
relationship to identity, how we perceive them, how we try to
monitor others' perceptions of them, and so much more- is not
nearly over; as a culture, we have not dealt with our physicality
anywhere near enough to make the leap comfortably into the realm
of utterly disembodied gender.

	On the whole, I support the idea of gender fluidity on the
Internet. I think it can only be a positive thing for people to

7
experience gender in as many ways possible, and to think about
how it is articulated. The Internet also makes you rethink your
assumptions about the gender of people you interact with- how do
you tell the gender of someone else on-line, and how is that
different or the same as in the real world? If members of on-
line role-playing communities feel broadened by their gender
experiments, then that, too, is a good thing. I believe the only
danger comes from making too tight a correlation between the
Internet world and the real world; a man may know what it is like
to "be" a woman on-line, but his experience may not hold true
outside that setting; to "be" a woman off-line is a different
kind of performance.
