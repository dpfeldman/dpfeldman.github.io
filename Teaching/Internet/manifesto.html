<h1 align=center> Manifesto Guidelines</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

<ul>

<li>Your manifesto should be an informed essay that takes a stand,
stakes out a position, makes some claims, etc.  It does not need to be
radical or strident, but you shold avoid a weak, middle-of-the-road
position.<p> 

<li>Your manifesto need not be written in a "scholarly" style.  Feel
free to play with language and write somewhat colloquially if you
wish.  <p>

<li>The manifesto should relate in some way to the stuff we've talked
about and read about in this course.  I expect that most manifestos
will contain references to some of the works we've read.<p>

<li>You should make an attempt to position your argument/stance/point
of view.  Do you depart with popularly held opinions about the
internet?  Which authors do you agree with?  Which thinkers do you
reject, which you agree with, etc.> <p>

<li>Audience: I plan on putting these manifestos up on the
course website.  Thus, your audience should be websurfers who might
be wondering what to make of the internet.<p>

<li>Length: I don't have strict length guidelines in mind.  I
more interested that you say some interesting stuff, not how long it
takes you to say it.  A <i>rough</i> length to shoot for is seven to
ten pages.<p>
