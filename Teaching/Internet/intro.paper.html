<br>

For this assignment, write a paper of at least two pages in which you
address the following:  
<ul>
<li>What big questions and concerns do you have about the internet?
<li>Do you have any strong feelings -- hopes or fears -- about the 
internet?
</ul>

This is sort of a "why do you want to take the class and what do you
want to get out of it" essay.  Your writing can be quite informal, but
should be clearly written.  Don't worry about writing a polished
essay.  The idea is to take a "snapshot" of your ideas, questions, and
feelings about the internet. <p>
