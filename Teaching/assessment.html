<h1>COA Math Assessment</h1>
<h2>How to Interpret Scores on the Diagnostic Test</h2>
</h2><p>
</center>

<h4>Note:  As of Fall 2001, the math assessment test is no longer 
administered to incoming students</h4>

<b>These ranges are guidelines; they are not meant to be interpreted
rigidly.</b>  The "dividing line" between The Nature and Language of
Mathematics and Introduction to Chaos and Fractals should be
interpreted especially loosely.<p>
 
Scores on this test are just one among many factors that
should be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate
math course.  Other considerations include:  Previous courses taken,
motivation, and confidence.  If you have any questions about which
math course is appropriate for you, please don't hesitate to ask.


<ul>
<li> <b>Greater than 35:</b> Almost definitely ready for calculus.
<li> <b>Between 25 and 35:</b> Probably ready for calculus,  almost
definitely ready for statistics.
<li> <b>Between 15 and 25:</b> Understanding Functions or Introduction
to Chaos and Fractals.  Might be ready for statistics.  
<li> <b>Less than 15:</b> The Nature and Language of mathematics is
probably the best choice.  
</ul>

Students who are unsure about what math courses to take are encouraged
to talk to me (Dave Feldman).  The questions and answers below might
also prove helpful.<p><br>
