<b>Due Friday 31 March, 2006</b><p>  This assignment is shorter than
most assignments will be.<p><br>

<b>Autobiography:</b>  Write a brief paragraph (or send me an email)
describing the math classes you've taken previously.  Be sure to
indicate where you took those classes: high school, COA, another
college.  Feel free to mention any other information about your math
background that might be relevant, interesting, and/or amusing. Also,
please let me know what other courses you expect to take this term,
and if there are some areas (art, policy, education, etc.) in which
you're particularly interested and/or you're focusing while at COA.<p>   


<b>Chapter 2</b>

(Note:  What this means is that the first problem you should do is
problem number 2 from chapter 2, the second problem you should do is
problem 3 from chapter 2, and so on.)
