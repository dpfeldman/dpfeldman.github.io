<h1 align=center> Intro to Chaos and Fractals</h1> 
<h2 align=center> Short Papers</h2>

<b>The first paper will be due Monday 10 April, 2005.</b><p>

Here are some guidelines for the short papers.

<ul>
<li>These papers should be around two pages in length.
<li>Stylistically, these papers should be somewhere between a
well-developed journal entry and an analytic essay.  You do not need
to come to any grand conclusion.  It's fine to raise more questions
than you answer.  
<li>I recommend pursuing one or at most two ideas in depth, rather
than writing a little bit about lots of different ideas. 
<li>The audience you should probably have in mind while writing is:
you, me, and the rest of the people in the class.
<li>I strongly recommend writing in the first person.
<li>I'm looking for evidence of critical thought, not a summary of the
reading.  
<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed.  
<li>Explore one or at most two ideas.
<li>Write about something that interests you.  
<li>Your writing should be clear; use "correct" usage.  Grammar and
overall clarity will be part of your evaluation.  The writing can be
quite informal, but should still read well.
<li>Please hand in your papers on time.  If papers are frequently
late, I'll mention this on your narrative evaluation.  If you need
extra time, let me know.
<li> You can always re-write your papers.  
<li> Working with a writing tutor is strongly recommended. 
</ul>
