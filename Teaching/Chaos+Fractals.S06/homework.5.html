<h2 align=center>Homework 5</h2>

<b>Due Friday 21 April, 2006</b><br><br>

<b>If you want to do these exercises in pairs and hand in only one
write-up, that's fine with me.</b><br><br>

<b>Chapter 8</b>
<ol>
<li>1
<li>3
<li>4 
<li>6 (optional.  do this if you feel like doing some algebra) 
</ol>

<b>Bifurcation Diagram Explorations</b>

If you have questions about any of these, be sure to ask me.  These
aren't intended to be tricky or vexing.  If you have computer
difficulties, let me know.  <br><br>

To answer these questions, you'll need to use a program to make
bifurcation diagrams. A good web-based program is <a 
href="http://www.cs.laurentian.ca/badams/LogBif/LogBifApplet.html">http://www.cs.laurentian.ca/badams/LogBig/LogBigApplet.html</a>.<br>
<br> 

You will also want to use the program from last homework to calculate
orbits of the logistic equation.  This program can be found at <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/orbits.html</a>.
<br><br> 
 
And lastly you'll want the program I used in class to plot
simultaneously the orbits for two different initial conditions.  This
program can be found at:  <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/initial.conditions.html">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Chaos/initial.conditions.html</a>.<br><br> 

<ol>
<li>By experimenting with the bifurcation diagram program, find r
values that yield orbits with the following properties.  Once you're
found the r value, check that it's behaving as you expect by using the
orbit program.  There are many possible answers to these questions.
Briefly summarize your findings.  You don't need to print out any
graphs, unless you find some that look really neat or are particularly
helpful for explaining things.
<ol>
<li> Period 4
<li> Period 6  (Hint:  Look near period 3.)
<li> Chaotic behavior for some r not equal to 4. (There are many
possible r values to choose from.)
<li> Period 5  (Hint:  Look between 3.7 and 3.8.)
<li> Periodic behavior of some other period that's not a multiple of
2.  (Be sure to state what the period is you've found.)
</ol>
<li> For each r value, do the following.
<ul>
  <li> Determine the long-term behavior of the orbits. Are the orbits
  periodic (what period?) or chaotic?  <li> Does the equation show the
  butterfly effect?
</ul>
Sketch or print out any graphs you use to draw your conclusions.
<ol>
  <li>3.7
  <li>3.835
  <li>3.5699456718695445 (don't round off).
</ol>
