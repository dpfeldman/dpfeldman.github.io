<h3>Links more or less related to the course</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amath.colorado.edu/appm/faculty/jdm/faq.html">FAQ
for sci.nonlinear</a>.  Lots of good, reliable information here.
Might be a little on the technical side at times.<p>

<li><a href="http://hypertextbook.com/chaos">The Chaos
Hypertextbook</a>.  A nice introduction to chaos and fractals, at a
level similar to the Devaney text we're using.  The list of <a
href="http://hypertextbook.com/chaos-links/93.shtml">internet
resources</a> is extremely good.  This is a very helpful index of
around 200 links.<p>

<li><a
href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/complexity/CompLexicon.html">Complexicon</a>.
This site, originally designed to accompany an exhibit at the
explortorium science museum, is a very good glossary of some of the
key terms in chaos and fractals.  There are also brief biographies of
many of the physicists and mathematicians who have done work in
dynamical systems.  <p>

<li><a href="http://www.around.com/">James Gleick</a>.  Yup, the
author of our book has a web page.  He has some interesting articles
up.

<li><a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/FLAOH/cbnhtml/index.html">Computational
Beauty of Nature</a>.  Some good info, and some very cool java applets.<p>
<li>Here are two great Cellular Automata pages:
<ol>
<li><a
href="http://alife.santafe.edu/alife/topics/ca/caweb/">Exploring the
Space of Cellular Automata</a>.  This site has a very easy-to-use
interface that will let you produce tons of space-time diagrams.  (To
find this interfact, follow the elementray CA link or go <a
href="http://alife.santafe.edu/cgi-bin/caweb/simple.cgi">here</a>. 
<li><a href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/kitchen.html">The Primordial
Soup Kitchen</a>.  This site was built by <a
href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/cook.html">David Griffeath</a>, a
math prof at the University of Wisconsin.  Lots of colorful applets
here.
