<b>These problems will be due next week, but you might want to
start them this week</b><p>

<b>Volume of a Donut</b>
Compute the volume of a solid torus (aka a <a
href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com">donut</a>)  with inner radius R
and outer radius r.  Be sure to label r and R on a diagram; there are
different ways to define them. <p>
 
<b>Surface Areas and a trip to the Moon</b>
In answering the following questions, you should derive any surface
area formula you use.  I suggest beginning by trying to use
integration to derive the formula for the surface area of a sphere.
Start this problem this week, but it won't be due until next week.
This problem isn't easy.   
 
<ol>
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible from the moon?
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible if you are 35,000
feet above the surface of the earth?
<li>What fraction of the earth's surface is visible from a satellite
orbiting 280 km above the surface of the earth?
</ol>
