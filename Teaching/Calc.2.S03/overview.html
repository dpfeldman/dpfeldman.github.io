<h3>Course Overview
</h3>

I have five main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
    solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
    <li>I want you to gain a firmer understanding of the theory and
    applications of integral calculus, and a solid introduction to
    infinite sums and series.
    <li>I want to have fun while working hard and learning a lot.
    <li>I want you to gain experience using computer to help you do
    mathematics. 
   <li>I want you to learn independently about a topic of your
    choosing and to gain experience orally presenting technical
    information.
</ol>
<p>

As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, third edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. I would like to cover most of Chapters
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.<p>
<!--  <i>Calculus
made Easy</i>, by Thompson and Gardner will be on reserve in the
library.  This is a fun, informal, entertaining introduction to
Calculus.  I won't assign any reading from it, however.<p>-->

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based roughly on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 60 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I encourage students to not take letter grades; I think
doing so usually helps students learn and be more critical of their
education. <p>

<h3>Tutors</h3>
<ul>
<li> The following students are available for calculus help: Eda
Kapinova and Nishad Jayasundara.
<li> Jacob Usinowicz is available for help with Maple.
<li> The tutors will have some regular hours, and you should also feel
free to contact them to find a time to meet. 
</ul>

<!--<h3>Parts of the Course</h3>

There are four distinct parts to this course.  Each has a different
feel to it.  It will be useful to bear this in mind as the course
progresses. 
<ol>
<li>Chapter 1.  "Review" of functions.  This part of the course lays
the ground work for all that follows.  The purpose is not just to
refresh your memories about sine functions and such, but to get you
thinking about functions in different ways -- ways that will be
helpful as we learn to do calculus.  There's a method to the book's
madness.  This part of the course has been frustrating for students.
The review can be a little overwhelming, since we'll cover a bunch of
different things fairly rapidly.  There will be times when the class
moves too slow, and other times when it feels like it's going too
fast.  By the end of two weeks, however, it's been my experience that
everyone has their feet underneath them.

<li>Chapters 2 and 5.  Here we're introduced to the main ideas of
calculus: the derivative and the integral.  To many of you,
particularly those who have had calc before, this will seem very
unmathy: there's lots of writing and drawing pictures and not so many
formulas.  But don't be fooled -- this is actually the most substantial
part of the course and is one of our textbook's greatest strengths.

<li>Chapter 3.  Here we learn all sorts of methods for taking
derivatives.  This will probably seem like the most traditional part
of the course.  You'll learn various methods (which you won't need to
memorize) and will practice them lots.  This portion of the course is
also probably the most tedious.

<li>Chapters 9 and 10.  Here we learn all sorts of useful and surprising
applications of the derivative.  This is challenging, but is also fun.
This is our reward for all the hard work in the earlier parts of the
course.   
</ol>

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.
<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will almost surely
  result in me mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may
  result in a lowering of your grade.   
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  
<li>If your HW is substantially late, I may not be able to grade it
fully.  I'll check off that you did it, but I might not have time to
make as many comments and suggestions as I normally do.
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.  If you
    consult other texts or the internet, be sure to cite your
    sources.  
<li>The midterm will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
  You may not, however, get any help from any humans during the exam.
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
do the reading before class. 
<!--<li>Instead of me presenting examples, I will often assign a few short
    problem that a pair of students will present in class.  This
    presentation is highly informal. -->
<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  
<li>I expect you to attend class.  Missing a few classes isn't a big
deal.  Please let me know beforehand if possible.  
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad. Any cases 
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty several winters ago.
