%\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: Edfinity}. There are no Edfinity problems this
week.\\ 


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook Section}.
Here are some 
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs. 
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  over 40 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
  is challenging.)
\item If you want, you can do all the problems in pairs and hand
  in only one set of solutions.
\item If you work with someone else and they submit the solutions, it
  would be helpful for me if you submitted the assignment (without an
  attachment) on google classroom and mentioned who you worked with.
  Thanks. 

\end{itemize}


\noindent {\bf {\large IMPORTANT!!}}  Be sure you have the most
current version of the textbook.  Go the webpage and do a hard
refresh!  Sorry for yelling.\\
