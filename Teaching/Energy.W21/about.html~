  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
</header>

<p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
  assignments (approx 90%) and your contributions in discussion
  sections (approx 10%).  There will be weekly homework assignments
  and, towards the end of the course, some mini-case studies and
  projects.  I think there is much to be said against grades; I
  believe they often interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But
  I am happy to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of
  A's, B's, etc. 
</p>

  <p>what's the deal with this course?</b>
  <h2>More Detailed Info</h2>
</header>

<!-- <li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page.-->
<ol>
<li>This is my tenth time teaching this class, so I have a pretty good
  sense of how it will go.  But this is my first time teaching it
  online, so I don't know how that's going to go.
<!--  That said, this course is continually
  evolving.  An ongoing challenge for me is what material to include
  and what to leave out.  I'm also continuing to experiment with the
  ordering of topics. -->

<!--<li>During the first part of the course there will almost always be
  homework due at the beginning of class.  Every day.  Evaluation on
  these assignments will be based mostly on effort.  It is essential
  that you do these assignments.-->

<!--<li> During the first part of the course you will be taking a number
  of mastery quizzes.  These are short tests designed to make sure you
  have mastered key skills.  The mastery quizzes must be completed
  without the help of others, and ideally without notes.  You can
  re-take these quizzes if needed. -->

<li>This class will be large by COA standards.
  <!--You and I will need to work together to make sure that this
  classtime is comfortable and effective, and that outside of class
  people are able to get all the help they need.-->
  We'll need to work together to make sure that everyone can get the
  help they need outside of class.  I have taught classes, including
  this one, with more than thirty students and it worked out fine. So
  I'm not worried.  

<li>Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
  confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
  sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can offer
  help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know who needs
  it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if you need
  it. On a related note ... 

<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
  with others and seeking help if you need it.  

<li>During the first 1-2 weeks of the class I want to spend some time
  building community: getting to know each other and getting in to the
  routine of zoom classes.</li>

<li>This class, especially at the beginning, will move fairly quickly
  and there will be a lot of work. This course is about building
  quantitative and analytical skills, and the only way to do this is
  through lots of practice. Weeks two-four may be a little challenging
  as you get your feet under you and (re)develop some skills. </li>

  
<!--<li> During the second part of the course there will be a significant
  emphasis on group projects.  You will be expected to fully
  participate in these projects and reserve Thursday afternoon lab
  time for group meetings during the second half of
  term. Presentations and final reports will be graded per group. To
  encourage sharing the significant workload, each student will
  complete a confidential peer appraisal reviewing each member's
  contribution to the group.   
-->
 
<li> As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email (or email alerts via google classroom), it
  is important that you check your email regularly. 

<!--<li> Unless we have made arrangements in advance, you are expected to 
  come to class and participate in group exercises. -->


<li>I recommend acquiring a simple calculator.  You can use your
  phone, but my experience is that calculators are much easier and
  faster to use.  

<li>I am writing a book based on this class.
  I will be writing as the term progresses and sharing updated drafts
  with you.  I'd encourage you to not print out the entire book, as it
  will be changing almost daily.  Feedback and suggestions are welcome.  

<li>In order to supplement what we do in class, I plan on making a
  number of short videos, mostly working through example problems.
  <!--If you have requests for topics or examples, please let me know.-->

<li>There will be two discussion sections on Tuesdays.  You should
  attend one discussion section each week.  I would prefer that you
  attend the same section each week if possible.  The discussion
  sections will be a chance to discuss some of the more complex and
  multi-layered issues that we won't be able to dig into in class,
  including social and environmental impacts of various energy
  technologies.  There will frequently be short readings to do that
  we'll discuss in the discussion section.  
  
<!--<li> This class is a lot of work.  It's very important to not fall
  behind.  Doing well on your project will require a significant time 
  investment.  Most of this work will occur weeks 5-10. -->

<li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
  technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
  There is also a temptation to get bogged down in debates about
  policy.  We should collectively resist these temptations; there are
  a lot of important topics to learn about. 

<li>Many of the examples in this class are based on a US context.  I
  will incorporate other contexts as I can, and will try to make clear
  differences between the US and elsewhere in terms of energy. 
  
<li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
  institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
  academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
  fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
  make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
  others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
  evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
  his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
  for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
  discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
  scholarship arise."
  
<li>You should expect to spend 150 hours of academically engaged time
  on this course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4 hours per
  week in class por discussion section, in a typical week you'll spend
  2.5 hours reading and preparing for class and 8.5 hours attending
  help sessions and completing assignments. 

</ol>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>You learn math and physics (or anything, really) by
    practicing</p>
  <h2>Stuff about Homework</h2>
  </header>
<ol>
  <li> Homework will almost always be due at the end of the day on
    Friday.  <!--(What this means is that I come to campus sometime
    Saturday morning and empty my mailbox of homework assignments.) -->\
    I will accept late homework assignments. However, I may 
    not grade these assignments thoroughly.  Multiple late
    assignments may result in a lowering of your grade and a mention in
    your narrative evaluation.

  <li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal. Just let me know. But try to avoid
    falling farther behind every week.
    
  <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
    also consult me, teaching assistants, other faculty, friends, and
    family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
    understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
    problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
    just copy their solution and turn it in. 
    
  <li>In fact, on most assignments there will be at least one problem
    that I'll ask you to do in pairs.
    
  <li>Most homework assignemnts will include some problems assigned on
    Edfinity, an electronic homework platform.  There are several
    benefits to Edfinity:
<ul>
  <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can learn
    right away from your mistakes.  You can submit solutions many
    times until you get everything correct. 
  <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, the TAs and I can
    spend more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
    grading. 
  <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get slightly
  different versions of the questions. This means that collaborating
  with other students will be maximally effective, since you'll have
  to share solution methods and not just the final answer.  
</ul>     
Edfinity takes a little getting used to. If you encounter any problems
  with the platform, be sure to ask for help. 
</ol>

  <p>Life in the zoomscape</p>
<h2>Getting the Most out of an Online Class</h2>
</header>
<ol><li>Video stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>As much as possible, please keep your video turned on during
	class.  This will help you stay engaged and will help me have a
	sense of how class is going.  I have been teaching a long time and
	am generally good at gauging whether or not a class is following
	what I'm teaching.  But I won't be able to do this if I'm looking at
	a screen full of black rectangles.</li> 
      <li>Of course if you have connection problems or if you need to turn
	the camera off for a few minutes, that's fine.</li>
      <li>It's ok to wear pajamas to class. </li>
      <li>Pets are welcome to join in. Especially cats.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>This class meets three times a week. Class sessions will vary in
    length but will almost never be more than an hour.</li>
  <li>I plan on turning on zoom at 9:30 but not starting class until
    9:45.  Please feel free to come early and hang out.  Some days I
    might still be getting ready for class.  Some days I might play some
    music (which you can mute if you don't like).  Other days I'll be
    available to chat.  Most days class will end around 10:45, but I'll
    keep zoom open until around 11:00 in case people have questions,
    want to talk, etc.
  <li>I strongly encourage you to take handwritten notes.  The
  physical component of taking notes helps to keep you engaged.  And
  taking handwritten notes requires you to do some on-the-fly
    synthesis and prioritization, deepening your understanding.
  <li>There will frequently be opportunities to practice problems in
  small groups.  As part of this you may want to hold your work up to
  the camera to show to others. 
</ol>

 

<header class="align-center">
  <p>I don't want to be negative, but</p>
  <h2>What this Class Isn't</h2>
</header>
This course is not about the following things, although this course
should help you do/think about the following things better and
more richly.
<ol>
  <li>Energy policy
  <li>Social impacts of energy technologies
  <li>Environmental impacts of energy technologies
  <li>Weatherproofing your house
  <li>Building your own wind turbine
  <li>Climate change and global warming
  <li> A physics class 
</ol></p>


<header class="align-center">
  <p>you can get help, and a lot more, at help sessions</p>
  <h2>Help Sessions</h2>
</header>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions.
You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these sessions.
Things that happen at help sessions:
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.
  <li>Other students do the problems at home or in the library and
    come to the help session with specific questions. 
  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also wander into other areas: politics,
    the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes are
    offered next term, and so on.
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.
</ol>
Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>there are lots of good reasons why you might want to meet with me
    one-on-one</p>
  <h2>Individual Meetings</h2>
</header>
I am happy to meet with students one-on-one, either in my office or in
the dining hall.  The best way to set up an appointment is to send me
an email.  There are lots of reasons why you might want to me:
<ol>
  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
    explore in a help session.
  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
  uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
  uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
  questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
  nevertheless.)
  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
    internships, senior projects, etc.
</ol>  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
discuss. </p>
