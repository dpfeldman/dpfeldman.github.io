  <p>what your evaluation will be based on</b>
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
</header>

<p>Your evaluation will be based on your performance on homework
  assignments (approx 90%) and your contributions in discussion
  sections (approx 10%).  There will be weekly homework assignments
  and, towards the end of the course, some mini-case studies and
  projects.  I think there is much to be said against grades; I
  believe they often interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But
  I am happy to assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of
  A's, B's, etc.

  <p>what's the deal with this course?</b>
  <h2>Structure and Pacing</h2>
</header>

<!-- <li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page.-->
<p>
This is my tenth time teaching this class, so I have a pretty good
  sense of how it will go.  But this is my first time teaching it on
  zoom, so there are some things I'm uncertain of:
  <ul>
    <li>It will take me a little while to get used to the mechanics
    of the class: writing with a sharpie on paper instead of a
    chalkboard, looking for questions in the chat, etc. Your patience
      and feedback is appreciated. </li>
    <li>It will also take time for me to figure out the pace of the
    class: how much we can comfortably cover in sixty minutes on
      Zoom.</li>
    <li>In addition to zoom, it is easy to for me to make videos
    presenting content or working through examples. We can adjust the
    ratio of recorded content to live zoom as needed.</li>
    <li>This class meets three times a week instead of the usual
    two. This gives us of flexibility, room to experiment, and the
    ability to take a snow day or two.</li>  
    <!--<li>Ruminations on help sessions are below in a separate
      section.</li>-->
  </ul>
</p>

<p>This class has several parts:
  <ol>
    <li>During the first 1-2 weeks of the class I want to spend some time
      building community: getting to know each other and getting in to the
      routine of zoom classes.</li>    
    <li>The first 1-4(ish) weeks we'll cover some core material and
      build up some skills.  We'll cycle back to to key ideas
      frequently.  This course is about building quantitative and
      analytical skills, and the only way to do this is through lots of
      practice. Weeks two-four may be a little challenging as you get
      your feet under you and (re)develop some skills. </li>
    <li>The last half of the class you'll have a solid base of skills
      and so the mechanics of the homework will likely go more smoothly,
      while the physics and climate implications of what we cover will
      get more and more interesting.</li>
    <li>At some point toward the middle of the course we'll take a
      little detour and learn some financial mathematics. You will
      likely find this more interesting than you think you're going to
      find it. Really.</li>
  </ol>
</p>


<p>There will be two discussion sections on Tuesdays.  You should
  attend one discussion section each week.  I would prefer that you
  attend the same section each week if possible.  The discussion
  sections will be a chance to discuss some of the more complex and
  multi-layered issues that we won't be able to dig into in class,
  including social and environmental impacts of various energy
  technologies.  There will frequently be short readings to do that
  we'll discuss in the discussion section.  
</p>


 


  


</ol>
</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>You learn math and physics (or anything, really) by
    practicing</p>
  <h2>Stuff about Homework</h2>
</header>
<p>
  <ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    math, and also this is most of what
    your evaluation will be based on.</li>
  <li>As discussed in <a href="https://youtu.be/xxv-Sxav1qQ">this
  video</a> there will be two parts to almost every homework
    assignment:
    <ul>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on Edfinity</li>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	google classroom</li>
  </ul></li>
  
  <li>Edfinity is an online homework system. I use this system even
    when the world is not in a global pandemic.  There are three reasons 
    why I use Edfinity:
    <ul>
      <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	many times until you get everything correct.</li>
      <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	final answer. </li>
      <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	grading.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
    time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
    with others and seeking help if you need it.  
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
    check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
  <li>I anticipate that there will be two exams one around week six
    and the other during the last week of the term. These exams will be
    open-notes and (essentially) untimed.</li>
  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
    phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
    not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
    ever). </li>
  </ol>
</p>

  <p>Life in the zoomscape</p>
  <h2>Getting the Most out of an Online Class</h2>
</header>
<p><ol>
    <li>This class meets three times a week on zoom. Class sessions will
    vary in length but will almost never be more than an hour.</li>
  <li>Video stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>As much as possible, please keep your video turned on during
	class. This will help you stay engaged and will help me have a
	sense of how class is going. I have been teaching a long time
	and am generally good at gauging whether or not a class is
	following what I'm teaching.  But I won't be able to do this if
	I'm looking at a screen full of black rectangles.</li> 
      <li>Of course if you have connection problems or if you need to turn
	the camera off for a few minutes, that's fine.</li>
      <li>It's ok to wear pajamas to class. </li>
      <li>Pets are welcome to join in. Especially cats.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>I plan on turning on zoom at 2:30 but not starting class until
    2:45.  Please feel free to come early and hang out.  Some days I
    might still be getting ready for class.  Some days I might play some
    music (which you can mute if you don't like).  Other days I'll be
    available to chat.  Most days class will end around 3:45, but I'll
    keep zoom open until around 4:00 in case people have questions,
    want to talk, etc.</li>    
  <li>I strongly encourage you to take handwritten notes.  The
    physical component of taking notes helps to keep you engaged.  And
    taking handwritten notes requires you to do some on-the-fly
    synthesis and prioritization, deepening your understanding.</li>
  <li>During class there will frequently be times where you will work
    in small groups on problems. Figuring out the best way to do this
    on Zoom might take some trial and error.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
 

<header class="align-center">
  <p>I don't want to be negative, but</p>
  <h2>What this Class Isn't</h2>
</header>
<p><ol>
    <li>This course is not about the following things, although this course
      should help you do/think about the following things better and
      more richly.
      <ul>
	<li>Energy policy</li>
	<li>Social impacts of energy technologies</li>
	<li>Environmental impacts of energy technologies</li>
	<li>Weatherproofing your house</li>
	<li>Building your own wind turbine</li>
	<li>Climate change and global warming</li>
	<li> A physics class </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>There may be a temptation to delve too deep into particular
      technology to the point that we're swamped with facts and details.
      There is also a temptation to get bogged down in debates about
      policy.  We should collectively resist these temptations; there are
      a lot of important topics to learn about.</li>

    <li>Many of the examples in this class are based on a US context.  I
      will incorporate other contexts as I can, and will try to make clear
      differences between the US and elsewhere in terms of
      energy.</li>
  </ol>
</p>



<header class="align-center">
  <p>you can get help, and a lot more, at help sessions</p>
  <h2>Help Sessions</h2>
</header>
<p>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions
every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
Things that happen at help sessions: 
<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
    specific questions.</li>
  <li>We can experiment with breakout rooms for folks who want to work
  together in small groups during the help session.</li>
<!--  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.-->
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>there are lots of good reasons why you might want to meet with me
    one-on-one</p>
  <h2>Individual Meetings</h2>
</header>
I am happy to meet with students one-on-one, either via zoom or in
some other CovidSafe way.  The best way to set up an appointment is to
send me an email.  There are lots of reasons why you might want to me:
<ol>
  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
    explore in a help session.
  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
  uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
  uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
  questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
  nevertheless.)
  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
  <li>You want to talk about other classes in energy or physics, or
    internships, senior projects, etc.
</ol>  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
discuss. </p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>Everyone is welcome and respected</p>
  <h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
</header>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown.
</p>



<header class="align-center">
  <p>Some fine print</p>
  <h2>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
</header>
<li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
  institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
  academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
  fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
  make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
  others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
  evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
  his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
  for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
  discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
  scholarship arise."
  
<li>You should expect to spend 150 hours of academically engaged time
  on this course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4 hours per
  week in class or discussion section, in a typical week you'll spend
  2.5 hours reading and preparing for class and 8.5 hours attending
  help sessions and completing assignments.
