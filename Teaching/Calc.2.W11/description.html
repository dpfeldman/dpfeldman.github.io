<h3>Informal Description</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
Here is some additional information and advice that should give you a
better idea what to expect from this class, how to enjoy it and do
well, and help you decide whether or not this class is for you.  
</b>

<ul>
    <li>   This class is a lot of work, but I think it's less work
    than Calculus I.  <br><br>

    <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
    confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
    sooner rather than later. There are many people around who can
    offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if we don't know
    who needs it when. You need to take responsibility to seek help if
    you need it. On a related note ...  <br><br>

    <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
    first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated -- I strongly
    suggest working with others and seeking help if you need it.<br><br> 

    <li> In Calc II <a href="www.sagemath.org">sage</a> will be more
    integrated into the course than it was in Calculus I. Knowing how
    to use a computer algebra and graphing system is important and, at
    times, essential, if you're going to do "real-world" and not
    text-book math. This may be frustrating for some, but I'm
    convinced it's worth it.  <br><br> 

    <li> This class meets three times a week, with the Wednesday time
    listed as a lab. My plan, however, is to treat the three meeting
    times pretty much the same. That is, we'll do lab stuff during
    class, and vice versa.  <br><br>

    <li> In many more traditional math classes the textbook has a ton
    of examples in them. The book we'll be using doesn't. The result
    is that students sometimes find the homework to be challenging,
    frustrating, and occasionally even annoying. However, I'm
    convinced that this style of homework -- where there's not an
    example just like the problem you're trying to do -- is much
    better pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this way.  <br><br>

    <li> This course covers pretty standard Calc II material. The
    text book we're using is used at many other colleges and
    universities in the U.S.  <br><br>
 
    <li> Many of you haven't taken Calc I here this year, and might
    not have taken and Calculus at all for a while. Don't worry. In
    the past, people who have taken calculus elsewhere have done very
    well in this course. We will review Calc I material as needed.  <br><br>

    <li> This class is a lot of work. However, the workload is steady;
    you'll be doing approximately the same amount of work each
    week. We'll hit the ground running and try to get lots of stuff
    done the next few weeks. The workload will taper off some toward
    the end of the term.  <br><br>

    <li>There are four parts to the class, each with a distinct
  feel.<br><br> 
<ol>
  <li>Introduction to the integral.  This part of the course is
  largely conceptual and will involve some numerical work and
  graphical reasoning.  (Chapters 5-6.) <br><br>
 
  <li>Shortcuts to evaluating the integral.  This is the most
  algebra-intensive portion of the course and in some ways may feel
  the most traditional. (Chapter 7.) <br><br>

  <li>Applications of integrals.  Here we will learn several
  different ways that integrals are used in various areas of math and
  science.    This is the most applied part of the course.  (Chapter
  8.  We won't cover all the chapters; which ones we do will depend on
  student interest.)<br><br>

  <li>Sequences and series.  This is a topic that is largely separate
  from the rest of the course.  It has a different feel to it.  The
  material can be a little difficult, but most students find it a nice
  change of pace and a good way to end the term.  (Chapters 9-10.)
