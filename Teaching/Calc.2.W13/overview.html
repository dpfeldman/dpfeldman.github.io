<blockquote>
    Surely no subject in early college mathematics is more exciting or
    more fun to teach than the calculus. It is like being the
    ringmaster of a great three-ring circus. It has been said that one
    can recognize the students on a college campus who have studied
    the calculus -- they are the students with no eyebrows. In utter
    astonishment at the incredible applicability of the subject, the
    eyebrows of the calculus students have receded higher and higher
    and finally vanished over the backs of their heads.

<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your problem  
    solving skills and mathematical confidence.  More generally, I
    want you to leave this course with an increased ability to
    <i>do</i> mathematics.
    <li>I want you to gain a firm, enduring understanding of one of
    the big ideas of calculus: the integral.
    <li>I also want you to gain a good introduction to infinite sums
    and series.    
    <li>I want you to be able to correctly perform
    mechanical calculations using the course content, apply problem
    solving skills to new areas, and effectively communicate problem
    solving strategies in writing.  
    <li>I want you to experience using a computer to help you do
    mathematics.  
    <li>I want you to learn semi-independently about a topic of your
    choosing and gain experience orally presenting technical
    information.  
    <li>I want you to have fun while learning a lot.
</ol>


<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p class="no-box"><br>
As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, fourth edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. Be sure you have the right edition of
the book.  <a href="./textbook.html">Here</a> is more information
about the text.  I would like to cover most, but certainly not all, of
chapters 5-9.   



<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 70 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 15 percent.
<!--<li><b>Lab Participation:</b> 5 percent.-->
</ul>
<p class="no-box">
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.  But I also
understand that many students believe (perhaps correctly) that grades
will make it easier to get into graduate or professional school.
</p>


<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<!--<li>There will be one midterm and one final exam.  Both tests will be
  open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.  You may not,
  however, get any help from any humans during the exam. -->

<li>This class meets three times a week, although we will not make use
  of all of these meeting times every week.  There is not a separate
  lab for the course, just the three meetings. 

<li> We will spend some time in class using the website wolfram alpha
  and perhaps a few other programs.  There won't be a separate lab
  session for this.  It will be incorporated into classes.  

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
functions, logs, and scientific notation.  You do not need a graphing
calculator for this course. 

<li>Toward the end of the term you will do a
  small <a href="./projects.html">project</a>. 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li> The tutors will have some regular hours, and you should also feel
  free to contact them to find a time to meet.  

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
    hearing; see the academic handbook for details.  Possible
    consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion.
