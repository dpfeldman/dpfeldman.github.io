<b>Homework 1:  Due Friday 10 January </b><p> For many of the
problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it still
might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning.<p> 
<br>

<b>Autobiography:</b>  Write a brief paragraph (or send me an email)
describing the math classes you've taken previously.  Be sure to
indicate where you took those classes: high school, COA, another
college.  Feel free to mention any other information about your math
background that might be relevant, interesting, and/or amusing. (10
points). <p>

<b>Computer Problem:</b>
Maple should be on the desktop of all PCs in the computer
labs.  Double click on the icon and, after a little bit of whirring, a
maple icon will appear.  Maple commands are fairly intuitive, but they
do take a little getting used to.  Maple has some pretty good built-in
tutorials.  A decent tutorial on plotting with maple can be found <a
href="http://www.math.sc.edu/~meade/math242/maple/day19.html#MapleAutoBookmark9">here</a>;
ignore the stuff about putting titles on plots, though.  For Maple
help from a real live human, talk to Arber Davidhi or me.  I also
recommend looking at the page of <a href="../../Maple/">Maple Help</a>
that I've put together. <p> 
<ol>
<li>Use Maple to plot f(x) = 4x^2, and then print out the plot.
(Hint, Maple doesn't understand 4x^2, but it does understand 4*x^2.)
(10 points)
<li>Use Maple to plot a cool function, and then print out the plot.
Be sure to say why you think the function is cool.  (10 points)
</ol>
<p>

<b>Bonus:</b>
<ol>
<li>1.2: 22
