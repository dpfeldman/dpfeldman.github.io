<h1 align=center>Short Response Paper</h1><p> 
<p>
<br>

<b>This paper will be due Friday 24 September, 2003.</b><p>

Here are some guidelines for the paper.

<ul>
<li>The paper can be about any aspect of the Great Gatsby.  Choose
something that's interesting to you!
<li>You will rewrite this paper at least once, and probably twice.  So
don't worry; what matters is the final product and how you develop
your ideas as you get there.  Take chances.  Say what's on your mind.
<li>Response papers should be two or, at most, three pages in length.
<li>The audience you should probably have in mind while writing is:
you, me, and the rest of the people in the class.
<li>I strongly recommend writing in the first person.  But you don't
have to. 
<li>I'm looking for evidence of critical thought, not a summary of the
reading.  
<li>This shouldn't be a research paper.  There's no need to draw upon
outside resources.  
<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed.  
<li>Explore one or at most two ideas.
<li>Write about something that interests you.  
<li>Your writing should be clear; use "correct" usage.  Grammar and
overall clarity factor into your evaluation.  The writing can be
quite informal, but should still read ok.
<li>Please hand in your papers on time. If you don't hand in your
paper on time, it'll take me longer to get you feedback so you can
revise your paper.  If you need extra time or something comes up, let
me know. 
<li> Working with a writing tutor is strongly recommended, and is
often fun.
