<h3>Course Overview
</h3>

I have several goals for this course.  I want you to:
<ol>
<li>Experience and participate in an introductory example of a human
ecological approach to a complex problem.
<li>Practice and improve some important skills:  writing, discussing,
critically reading. 
<li>Learn some stuff about inequality, economics, statistics,
political philosophy, segregation in U.S. cities, etc.
<li>Have fun while working hard and challenging our ideas.
</ol>
<p>


<b>Catalog Description:</b><br>
 
This interdisciplinary seminar is designed to provide students with an
introduction to human ecology and to engage students in significant
interactive inquiry. The focus of this year's class will be wealth. We
will take an interdisciplinary approach to this topic, drawing upon
the work of novelists, philosophers, political theorists, economists,
artists, and others. In so doing, our aim is to provide a model for a
human ecological approach to a complex social phenomenon, and to give
students experience in defining and addressing a complex subject. An
additional goal of this course is to introduce students to critical
reading, writing and discussion skills that are an essential
ingredient for a student's success at COA.<p>
 
This particular seminar will center on three broad questions of the
distribution of wealth. First, to what extent are resources and income
distributed unevenly throughout the world and in various countries and
societies? Second, do these inequalities matter? Why or why not? And
third, how do inequalities arise, why do they so often persist, and
how, if ever, can inequalities be ameliorated?  We will read
selections from a number of current and classical political and
economic thinkers as we consider these questions. Throughout the
course we will encounter several different notions of "fairness" or
"equity," and will critically examine each.  One of the questions that
will emerge is the extent to which one can, or cannot, predict
large-scale phenomena based on knowledge of simple interactions or
"rules of the game."  We shall see that the manner in which individual
preferences lead to societal outcomes is not always straightforward
and intuitive, and will discuss the implications of this
observation.<p> 
 
Evaluation will be based on class discussion and participation,
several short papers, several problem sets, and a final paper or
presentation.  Introductory. *HE* Lab fee $50.<p>

<b>Textual Materials:</b>
<ul>
<li>F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby.
<li>Barbara Ehrenreich.  Nickel and Dimed: On (not) Getting by in
America. 
<li>Many, many handouts and reserve readings.
</ul>

<p><br>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Final project</b>
<li><b>Participation in class discussion and activities</b>
<li><b>Short papers</b>
<li><b>Problem sets and other assignments</b>
</ul>

This seminar is offered only on a credit/no-credit basis.  Exceptions
to this may only be granted by Ken Hill or me.<p><br> 


<h3>Policies, Assignments, and Stuff: First Draft</h3>
<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Core_Course.04">http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Core_Course.04</a>.  

<li>A more colloquial list of what to expect from this class and how
to get a lot out of is can be found <a
href="expectations.html">here</a>. 

<li> We may need to schedule an extra class or two during weeks 9 or
10 so we have enough time for the presentations.  

<li> I will not be able to attend class on Thursday, October 7, since
I'll be giving the Physics department colloquium at Colby College that
Day.  We will discuss how to most conveniently make up the class.

<li>As I plan on often sending out homework assignments and
    other information via email, it is important that you check your
    email semi-regularly. 

<li>There will be a final synthetic paper, project, and/or
presentation.  We'll discuss the details of this in a week or two.

<li>In addition to the final project, there will be a few short papers
and a few problem sets.

<li>The particular topics and sets of readings we cover toward the end
of the course is flexible and will depend on student interest and
feedback.  

<li>I expect you to attend class.   

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as
    per pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range
    from failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
