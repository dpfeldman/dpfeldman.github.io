<b>This paper will be due Friday 21 November, 2003.</b><p>

(<a href="./final.presentation.html">Information on final
presentation</a>) <p>

Here are some guidelines for the paper.

<ul>
<li>Your paper should be synthetic.  It should tie together or reflect
upon some of the broad themes we've be discussing in this course.  You
should make reference to at least two of our readings or discussion
topics. 
<li>The paper can be about any of the topics or issues we've been
discussing in class.  Choose something that you care
about. 
<li>In your essay you should contain some significant analysis; don't
just summarize what we've done.
<li>You should take a stand; stake out some territory.  
<li>Your paper should be five to six pages in length.
<li>When you write, you should have a clear audience in mind.  It
could be other people in this class, other students at COA, people
from your hometown, the readership of a newspaper, etc.  
<li>If you refer to readings (which you probably should), be sure to
cite them thoroughly. 
<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed.  
<li>Your writing should be clear; use "correct" usage.  Grammar and
overall clarity factor into your evaluation.  The writing can be
quite informal, but should still read ok.
<li>I'd be happy to read over and comment upon drafts of your paper
before you hand in the final version.
<li> Working with a writing tutor is strongly recommended, and is
often fun.
