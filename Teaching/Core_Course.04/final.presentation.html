<h1 align=center>Final Presentation</h1><p> 
<p>
<br>


<b>If you do not tell me by Wednesday, November 5 that you'll be doing
a presentation, I will assume that you're writing a <a
href="./paper.final.html">paper</a> and not presenting.</b><P>


Here are some guidelines for your presentation.

<ul>
<li>Your presentation should be research-based.  I.e, you should be
presenting some new material, not just commenting on what we've all
already read or talked about.
<li>Your presentation should be around fifteen minutes in length, with
around five minutes for questions afterward.
<li>You will be evaluated based on both how well you understand your
topic (you should strive for a balance of breadth and depth) and
how well you present your material. 

<li>Your topic should be synthetic.  It should tie together or reflect
upon some of the broad themes we've be discussing in this course.  You
should make reference to or clearly build upon some of our readings or
discussion topics. 
<li>At the end of the term you should hand in an annotated
bibliography for your topic.
<li>I strongly recommend practicing your presentation, both with and
without an audience.

</ul>
