<p>
I have several main goals for this course:
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your problem  
    solving skills and mathematical confidence.  More generally, I
    want you to leave this course with an increased ability to
    <i>do</i> mathematics.
    <li>As part of this, I want you to experience using a computer to
    help you do mathematics.
    <li>I want you to learn semi-independently about a topic of
    your choosing and gain experience orally presenting technical
    information. 
    <li>I want you to gain a solid understanding of the theory and
    applications of integrals.
    <li>I want you to get a good introduction to infinite sums and
    series. 
    <li>I want to have fun while learning a lot.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, fourth edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. Be sure you have the right edition of
the book.  There should be a roller-coaster on the cover.  The ISBN
for the edition we're using is:  0-471-48482-2.  I would like to cover
portions of chapters 5-10.  
</p>


<p>
Your evaluation will be based roughly on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 65 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Project:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 5 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.
</p>

<p>
Policies and Details:
<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
able to grade these assignment thoroughly.  This means they will be of
significantly less use to you on exams.  

<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>There will be one midterm exam, which will be open notes, open
book, and (essentially) untimed.  You may not, however, get any help
from any humans during the exam.  The midterm will include a few
problems that you'll need to use Maple to do.

<li>There will not be a final exam.  Instead, students will do a small
<a href="./projects.html">final project</a>.

<li>In addition to me presenting ideas and examples, there will
frequently be problems to work on in small groups in class.  Use this
time well -- it is a chance to try out some ideas and get on the right 
track before starting the homework. 

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
functions, logs, and scientific notation.  You do not need a graphing
calculator for this course. 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li>Missing a few classes isn't a big deal.  Please let me know
beforehand if possible.   

<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any
    cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
    hearing; see the academic handbook for details.  Possible
    consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion.

<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

By your enrollment in an academic institution, you are subscribing to 
common standards of academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, 
falsifying or fabricating data, or illegally using artwork of others is 
a breach of such standards and is unacceptable. Students and faculty 
share responsibility to clarify conventions of attribution, so
that no one uses words or works of others, including artwork, 
without proper acknowledgment. If you do not understand or have 
questions about what
constitutes ethical scholarship, ask that the issue be discussed in 
class. Cases of academic dishonesty may be resolved between student 
and teacher or, at the discretion of either party, may be referred to 
a judiciary hearing coordinated by an Academic Dean. Consequences for
violations may range from losing credit for an assignment or course up 
to suspension or expulsion from COA. <p><br>


<h4>Academic Misconduct</h4>

Academic misconduct is a breach of common standards of academic honesty as 
well as a breach of any particular instructions provided by a professor 
in a given class. Examples include cheating, plagiarism, or any other form 
of using the work of another person without proper acknowledgment. Another
example of academic misconduct is the deliberate removal of library books 
or of essential reference or reserve material; this aspect also includes
monopolizing or abusing resources other students need to complete academic
projects. Cases of academic misconduct may be resolved between student and
teacher or, at the discretion of either party, may be referred to a 
judiciary hearing coordinated by an Academic Dean. Consequences for 
violations may range from losing credit for an assignment or course up to
suspension or expulsion from COA. <p><br>
