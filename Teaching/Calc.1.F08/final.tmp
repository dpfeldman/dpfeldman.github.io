<h2 align=center>Fall 2006<br>Final Homework-like Assignment<br> Due
Friday 17 November, 2006 </h2>


<p class="dotted">
<table>
<tr><td>

Treat this like a normal homework assignment.  You can work with each
other, ask me questions, work with tutors, consult other texts, etc.
The work you hand in, however, should represent your own
understanding.  I hope these are fun.  Do <b>one</b> of the following
options.  


<ol>

<li><a
href="./final.cans.html">Toward
a Quantitative Mathematical Human Ecology of Soup Cans</a>.  This was
the final set of problems from the course two years ago. Follow the
link <a href="./final.cans.html"><b>here</b></a>.


<li><b>Interstate Trucking:</b>  Project 3, Chapter Four, page
236. 

<li><b>Firebreaks:</b> Project 4, Chapter Four, page 237.
