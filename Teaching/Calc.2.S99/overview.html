<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, second edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al.  
I would like to cover most of chapters 6, 7, 8, and 10.  

I have four main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
<li>I want you to gain a firm understanding of three big calculus
ideas:  the limit, the derivative, and the the integral.
<li>I want you to learn how to use computers to help you do
math.  
<li>I want you to learn what differential equations are and what their
solutions mean.
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 50 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/ADMISSIONS/Registrar/CourseCatalog/AcademicPlanning/records.html">page 8</a>
of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br>

<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of the course syllabus will be on the course web page.  
<li>Homework will be due Mondays at 8pm.  Do not fall behind in the homework.
<li>All course work must be completed by the end of the term.  I will not grant
    an incomplete except in extreme circumstances.
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade no
    higher than a C.
<li>I expect you to attend class and labs.
<li>We will discuss final projects sometime during week two.  
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.
    You may not, however, get help from any humans during the exams.
<li>For each class for which I assign reading, you should arrive
    with at least one question or a comment on the reading.  I will often
    use your comments and questions as a starting point for class
    discussion. 
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.
