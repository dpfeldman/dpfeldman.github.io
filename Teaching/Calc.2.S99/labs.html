<h1> Physics I Labs</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

<h3>Lab Policies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Failing to attend labs will negatively affect your course grade and
  evaluation.  Labs are an important (and I hope fun) part of the
  course.  <p>

  <li>In the labs you will learn how to use the computer
  mathematics program Maple.  You will need to use Maple for some of
  your homework problems.

  <li>Typical labs will be around 1.5 hours.<p>

  <li>Labs will not meet every week.

</ul>
