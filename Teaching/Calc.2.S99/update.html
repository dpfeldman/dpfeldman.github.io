<B> (9/16) </b> <ul>

<li> The <a href="schedule.html">reading</a> for the next few weeks
and <a href="homework.html">homework</a> two have been assigned.<p>  
  
<li> I put a four page essay on Fermi and Fermi problems on reserve on
the library.    The author talks about
some additional Fermi problems and, more interestingly, discusses
mindset needed to do -- and enjoy! -- Fermi type problems.  <p>

<li> Also on reserve in the library, as I mentioned in class, is a talk
given by <a
href="http://www.physics.cornell.edu/physics/PROF.PAGES/MerminN.html">
N. David Mermin</a>  for the St. John's College commencement.  Mermin
talks about the role of quantitative science in a liberal arts
education.  I think the talk makes quite entertaining reading.  Your
mileage may vary.<p>

</ul>

<B> (9/10) </b> <ul>

<li>  Apparently the bookstore only purchased one of the two books I'm
planning on using.  We'll use both unit C and unit N or <i>Six
Ideas</i> this quarter.  So far only C has arrived.  This is ok, since
unit C is the one we'll use first.<p>
