      <h4>Differential Equations: Official Course Description</h4>
<p>Differential equations are an application of calculus used to model
  a wide variety of physical and natural phenomena. The rate at which
  a cup of coffee cools, populations of predators and prey in
  ecosystems, the spread of disease, and the behavior of electric
  circuits, are all examples of systems that have been described with
  differential equations. This course is an introduction to ordinary
  differential equations, intended for students who have completed a
  single-variable calculus course. The course covers a variety of
  techniques for solving and understanding differential equations,
  including numerical and qualitative solution methods. Students will
  learn to solve and analyze differential equations using the python
  programming language. Students will also gain experience formulating
  mathematical models using differential equations. To do so, we will
  discuss general modeling principles and also consider several case
  studies. In addition to learning the mathematics of differential
  equations, a central goal of this course is to gain skills necessary
  for research in the mathematical, natural, and social sciences. This
  includes conceptualizing and framing a research question, conducing
  a literature review, giving a research presentation, and writing up
  results in a style appropriate for publication. Evaluation will be
  based on class participation, bi-weekly problem sets, and a
  term-long project culminating in a presentation and short research
  paper. Some computer work will be required, but no computer
  experience is necessary. Level: Intermediate. Prerequisites:
  Calculus II or the equivalent or permission of instructor. Lab Fee:
  none. Meets the following degree requirements: <b>ES QR</b></p>

    <!-- Axioms Section -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-64 w3-large" id="axioms">
      <h1>Axioms</h1>
      <p> In mathematics, axioms are propositions that are assumed to be
	true. The mathematician Federico Ardila-Mantilla has written four
	axioms that guide the work he does in education and
	outreach. Federico's axioms resonate strongly with me. They are
	(slightly re-written to apply to physics as well as math): 
	<ol>
	  <li>Mathematical and physics potential is distributed equally among
	    different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and
	    economic boundaries.</li> 
	  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
	    math and physics experiences.</li> 
	  <li>Math and physics are powerful, malleable tools that can be
	    shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their
	    needs.</li>
	  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and
	    respect.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Community Agreement</h3>
      <p> Taking the above axioms as a starting point, let's think about
	what type of community we want to create this term. Here is a
	community agreement based on one written by Federico
	Ardila-Mantilla.
	<blockquote>
          This course aims to offer a joyful, meaningful, and
          empowering experience to every participant; we will build
          that rich experience together by devoting our strongest
          available effort to the class. You will be challenged and
          supported. Please be prepared to take an active, critical,
          patient, creative, and generous role in your own learning and
          that of your classmates.

	</p>
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Textbook</h3>
      <p>There is no textbook that you need to acquire for this
      course. However, I am writing a set of lecture notes to
      accompany this course. Information about how to access those
	notes will be on google classroom.</p>
      <hr class="day"></hr>

      
      <h3>Structure and Pacing</h3>
<p>
I've taught a version of this course six times before, so I have a
reasonably good sense of how things will go. There are three central
strands to this course:
<ol>
  <li>Differential equations (what they are and how to form models
    with them)
    <li>Computation using python 
    <li>Research projects
</ol>
These strands will flow more or less in parallel. I don't think this
will be a problem, but it may be just a tiny bit scattered at
first. </p>

      <p> Here is a very rough outline of the flow of the course.
	<ol>
	  <li>During the first 1-2 weeks of the class we'll spend some time
	    building community.</li>
	  <li>During the first 1-2 weeks we will also learn what
	    differential equations are and how to think about them. This
	    part of the class may feel mathematically intense, and you
	    may find yourself worrying that you don't know enough
	    calculus. <b>Don't worry</b>. The math intensity decreases
	    quite quickly after week two.</li>
	  <li>Also in the first part of the class, you'll learn some
	    basic python. (If you already know some python, it'll
	    still be interesting, and you can have fun helping other
	    students.) It may take a little while to get comfortable
	    with how we will use python in this
	    course. Again, <b>don't worry</b>.</li> 
	  <li>Sometime around week three or four, we'll have the math
	    and computational tools we need, and we'll spend the rest
	    of the term building, analyzing, and critiquing
	    models.</li>
	  <li>Toward the end of the term, you will be deep in your
	    research project and will experience the challenges and
	    rewards of pursuing an open-ended question.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      
      
      <hr class="day"></hr>
      <h3>Other Thoughts</h3><p>
	<ol>
	  <li>This class makes extensive use of ideas from
	  calculus. It's important that you've had both differential
	  calculus before and felt reasonably good about the
	  experience, although it's ok if you've forgotten much of
	  it. We will use the idea of a derivative almost daily, but
	    we will rarely use the mechanics of calculus.</li>
	  <li>This course is structured to allow you to do a
	  significant project as part of the coursework. You will need
	  to start early on this and keep moving throughout the
	  term. There will be numerous check-points throughout the
	  term, including an oral presentation during week
	    five. Falling behind in your project can be disastrous.</li>
	  <li>Throughout I will be taking a (hyper) "modern" approach
	  to differential equations. I emphasize qualitative, global
	  analysis of differential equations, rather than specialized
	  analytic tricks. We will frequently rely on numerical
	  solutions to differential equations. We will use computers
	  without guilt or apology to help us do mathematics and
	  science. All of this might give the course a different feel
	  than other math classes you've taken.</li> 
	</ol>
      </p>


      <hr class="day"></hr>
<h3>Research Projects</h3>
      <p>Research is an essential component of almost any area of
      study and field of work. Learning what research is, how to think
      about it, and how to do it well, are extremely important
      skills---ones that you will use in many, many areas beyond
      differential equations and mathematics. I think research skills
      are important enough that it is worth devoting a considerable
      fraction of this class to them.</p> 

      <p><b>Overview</b>: The research project should be an in-depth
      exploration of a particular application of differential
      equations. It may also be possible to do a more theoretical
      project. We will spend the first few weeks of the term talking
      about what research is, how to move from an area of interest to
      a topic, and how to relate a research question to a broader set
      of questions or concerns. There are three major "deliverables"
      associated with the project:</p> 
	<ol>
	  <li>Initial Presentation: During week five you will give an
	  initial presentation in which you introduce your topic. You
	  should give a sense of what you'll be doing the next several
	  weeks and the questions you'll wish to address. There are
	    three reasons for this initial presentation.
	    <ol>
	      <li>It will force you to choose a topic early rather
	      than later.</li> 
	      <li>It will let other people in the class know what
		you're up to, so you can get feedback and ideas from
		others.</li>
	      <li>It will give you a chance to practice giving technical
		presentations. You'll get feedback on your presentation
		from both me and classmates.</li>
	    </ol>
	    
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Final Presentations</b>: Sometime during week 10 we
	  will give presentations in a session open to the
	  community. These talks will follow the format of contributed
	    talks at a scientific meeting.</li>
	  <li><b>Paper or Technical Report</b>: Due on the last day of
	  the term. This will be a 5-20 page paper on your research
	  question. You should write in a style appropriate for
	  publication in a peer-reviewed journal of your choosing. (If
	  you want to explore another form, this is possible, but you
	  should clear this with me early on.) Your paper must be
	  well-formatted, include figures and graphs as appropriate,
	  and correctly use the citation format standard for whichever
	  journal you choose.</li> 
	</ol>
</p>

  <p>Throughout the term we will spend time discussing a number of
  issues and ideas in research, and also cover some specific research
  skills. This will likely include: 
<ul>
  <li> The difference between interests, topics, questions, and problems</li>
  <li> The mechanics of peer-reviewed journals and academic publishing</li>
  <li> The rhetorical style of research papers</li>
  <li> How to search for sources, including using the citation lists
    available in Google scholar</li>
  <li> How to give an effective technical presentation</li>
  <li> Ethics in research, plagiarism and academic fraud, issues
    around generative AI</li>
  <li> Software for organizing and automating bibliographies</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I probably will also divide you up into small groups based on
    similarity of interests and ask your groups to meet and/or share
    resources.</p>

<p>A few of these discussions may sound not that interesting, but give
  them a shot. In the past students have found these topics to be
  useful and quite helpful.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that some of you will "get farther" in your
  projects than others, since some of you are farther along in your
  studies. Also, some research topics are harder to make progress on
  than others. This diversity is fine. The point of the projects
  is not to come up with publishable original research or even have
  an amazing and polished final result. Rather, the idea is to strive
  toward as good a result as possible, and learn a lot (and challenge
  yourself and have fun) while doing so.</p>

<p>Finally, as you may have guessed, I suspect that these research
  projects will be a lot of work. But with a good topic and the right
  attitude, I think this work can be very fun and rewarding. And I
  think doing a term-long project like this will be very helpful
  before undertaking your final project or a research internship
  somewhere. </p>


	<hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>Stuff about Homework</h3><p>
      <ol>
	<li>There will be several homework assignments during the
	  first half of the course. It is essential that you do these
	  assignments, as this is how one learns math.</li> 
	<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
	  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be mindful to not fall
	  farther behind every week. </li>
	<li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
	  don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
	  time. Don't let yourself get frustrated. I strongly suggest working
	  with others and seeking help if you need it.  
	<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
	  can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
	  and family. However, the homework you hand in should represent
	  your own understanding.</li>
	<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
	  information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
	  check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
	<li>You will need to have at your disposal a laptop or tablet
	  that you can use for coding. If you don't have one, let me
	  know and we'll figure something out.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <hr class="day"></hr>


      <h3>Help Sessions</h3>
      <p>
	I will have a handful of help sessions
	every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
	sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
	Things that happen at help sessions: 
	<ol>
	  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework and projects.</li>
	  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
	    session. They work through problems alone or with others, and
	    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
	    needed.</li>
	  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
	    specific questions.</li>
	  <li>Some students work in groups at help sessions, others work more
	    or less alone.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
	    the course. Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
	    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
	    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
	  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
	    class.</li>
	  <li>Often there will be coffee/tea and/or snacks.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>
      
      <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
      <p>I am happy to meet with students one-on-one.  The best way to set
	up an appointment is to send an email. There are lots of reasons
	why you might want to meet with me: 
	<ol>
	  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
	    explore in a help session.</li>
	  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
	    uncomfortable asking in a help session. (You shouldn't be
	    uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
	    questions! But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
	    nevertheless.)</li>
	  <li>You want to explore possibilities for energy projects on campus
	    or in the community.</li>
	  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
	  <li>You want to talk about other classes in math or physics, or
	    internships, senior projects, etc.
	</ol>  
	Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
	discuss. You should also feel free to reach out to the TAs. </p>

      <hr class="day"></hr>

      <h3>What your Evaluation is Based on</h3>
      
<p>Your evaluation will be roughly on the following
  <ul>
    <li>Homework assignments (30%)</li>
    <li>Research projects (60%)</li>
    <li>Engagement in class activities and discussions (10%)</li>
  </ul>
  The research project consists of multiple components: mid-term
  presentation, final presentation, final paper/report, and
  several preliminary assignments.
</p>

<hr class="day"></hr>

<h3>Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
	backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
	that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
	and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
	as a resource, strength, and benefit. I aim to present
	materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
	sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
	ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>
      
      <p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
	process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
	and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
	other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
	encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
	improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
	other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
	class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
	please let me know.  You can also reach out to: Provost

      <h3>Gender-based discrimination: Title IX</h3>

      <p>COA is committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and
	inclusive campus where all community members have equal access
	to education and employment. We will not tolerate sexual
	harassment or gender-based discrimination of any kind.</p>
      
      <p>As a faculty member, I am considered a "Responsible
	Employee." This means I am required to share any disclosures
	of sexual or gender-based misconduct with the Title IX
	Coordinator—even if the incident occurred before your time at
	COA. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that anyone
	who has experienced sexual misconduct is offered support,
	information about their rights, and access to available
	resources. Please know that you are not required to respond to
	outreach, and a disclosure does not automatically result in a
	report to law enforcement. </p>

      <p>If you would like to ask questions or explore support
	options, you are encouraged to contact COA's Title IX
	Coordinator, Puranjot Kaur, at pkaur@coa.edu. Speaking with
	the Title IX Coordinator does not automatically initiate a
	college resolution process. Much of her work focuses on
	providing supportive measures to help you continue to fully
	participate in COA's programs and activities.</p>

      <h3>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
	Engagement</h3>
      <p><ul>
	  <li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
	    institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
	    academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
	    fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
	    make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
	    others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
	    evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
	    his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
	    for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
	    discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
	    scholarship arise."</li>
	    
	  <li>I am also required to say that: You should expect to
	    spend 150 hours of academically engaged time on this
	    course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 4.5 hours per 
	    week in class or discussion section, in a typical week
	    you will spend 2 hours reading and preparing for class and
	    8.5 hours attending help sessions and completing
	    assignments. </li>

	  <li><b>Can I use generative "AI" tools</b> like chatGPT or
	    Gemini? Long answer: we'll talk about this in class and
	    come up with some guidelines. But in brief:
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>For coding</b>? Yes. Definitely.</li>
	      <li><b>For writing</b>? Generally, no. Quoting
	      <a href="https://www.coa.edu/live/profiles/3623-martha-donovan">Martha 
	      Donovan</a>, "I expect all drafts of written work for this
	      course to be your own. I am interested in reading and
	      responding to your own original thinking and writing at
	      every phase of the writing process." But we'll talk
	      about the nuances of this.</li>

      The building in which we gather for this class, and all of
      College of the Atlantic, is located on traditional lands of the
      Wabanaki people. The four Native American tribes in Maine today
      are the Maliseet, Micmac, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy,
      collectively referred to as the Wabanaki. Although largely a
      technical class, we will touch upon questions of energy
      colonialism and imperialism. I believe it is important to
      acknowledge that our presence on this land entangles us in the
      web of colonialism, past and present. The future, however, is
      still unwritten.</p> 
    
    <!--<p>In this class we will learn about non-fossil fuel sources of
      energy. Transitioning to a fossil fuel free society is essential to
      avoid catastrophic climate change. College of the Atlantic, and by
      extension all of us, historically and presently benefit from energy
      provided by inexpensive fossil fuel sources. Again, we are entangled
      with the system that we seek to replace.</p> -->
