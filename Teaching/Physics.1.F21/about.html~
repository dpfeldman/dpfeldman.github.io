  <p>here's what i hope you learn in this course</b>
  <h2>Course Goals</h2>
</header>

<ol> 
<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative analytical skills,
    problem solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  
<li>I want you to learn several big physics ideas: conservation of
    energy, momentum, and angular momentum, and Newton's laws, and be
    able apply these ideas in quantitative and qualitative settings. 
</ol>
<p>Basically the idea is to learn some physics and also to learn some of
the analytical and quantitative skills that physicists use. These
include: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Developing a systematic, organized, and effective approach to
    problem solving 
  <li> Becoming comfortable and confident making approximations and
    estimations 
  <li>Mastering unit conversions and gaining familiarity with
  dimensional analysis   
</ol>

  <p>what your evaluation will be based on</b>
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
</header>

<p>Your evaluation will be based on the items listed below.  I think
  there is much to be said against grades; I believe they often
  interfere with genuine, reflective learning. But I am happy to
  assign grades if you wish. I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.

  <p>what's the deal with this course?</b>
  <h2>Structure and Pacing</h2>
</header>

<!-- <li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page.-->
<p>
This is my eleventh time teaching this class, so I have a pretty good
  sense of how it will go.  But this is my first time teaching it in
  the new building and in the midst/aftermath of a global pandemic.

<!-- <li> There will be times in class when we go over something that
    you already understand. There may also occasionally be times when
    you feel lost in class for a little bit. If this happens, don't
    despair. Ask a question or talk to me or one of the TAs after
    class. -->

<li><b>If you are required to quarantine or isolate as a result of
    possible exposure to COVID-19 you will not be penalized (in your
    final grade or narrative evaluation) for missing class or lab
    sessions.  If in doubt, please do not come to class</b>.  Let me
    know if you have to miss class and we'll figure something out.  I
    expect that most classes will be recorded and posted online.</li>

    <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
    confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
    sooner rather than later. This course builds on itself&mdash;what we do
    in week three will depend on what we did in week two, what we do
    in week four depends on week three, etc. There are many people
    around who can offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if
    we don't know who needs it when. You need to take responsibility
    to seek help if you need it. On a related note ... 

    <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
    first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated&mdash;I strongly suggest
    working with others and seeking help if you need it. I also
    strongly suggest that you start the homework well before it's
    due. 

    <li> In many math and physics classes the
    textbook has a ton of examples in them. The book we'll be using
    doesn't. The result is that students sometimes find the homework
    to be challenging, frustrating, and occasionally even
    annoying. However, I'm convinced that this style of homework&mdash;where
    there's not an example just like the problem you're trying to
    do&mdash;is much better pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this
    way. 

    <li> This course covers fairly standard Physics I material. The
    only exception to this is that our book begins with conservation
    laws, and leaves Newton's laws for later. There are a few other
    texts that do this, but most do it the other way around. The text
    book we're using is used at many other colleges and universities
    in the U.S. If you've had Physics before, in high school or at
    another college, you'll probably find most of the material
    familiar. You should talk with me to make sure that this course
    won't be too much review for you. 

    <li> This class is listed as an introductory course. I do not
    assume that you've had physics before. Although our textbooks
    occasionally use calculus, calculus is most definitely not a
    prerequisite for this class. This class makes extensive use of
    algebra and trigonometry. If you've never had trig before, you can
    still take this class, but you might have some extra work you'll
    need to do the first few weeks. In the past, students without a
    trig background have taken this class and done fine. 

    <li> This class is a lot of work. However, the workload is fairly
    steady; you'll be doing approximately the same amount of work each
    week. We'll hit the ground running and try to get lots of stuff
    done the next few weeks. The workload will taper off some toward
    the end of the term. 

    <li>The workload in this class starts off heavier and increases in
    difficulty and amount the first several weeks.  After around week
    three and chapter C5 things will level off and perhaps even get
    easier. 

    <li> Labs in this class may be different than those you've
    encountered in other science classes. There will not be a formal
    write-up, aka a "lab report", due at the end of the lab. Instead,
    the emphasis is on playing/experimenting with some equipment,
    trying some stuff out, and learning some skills we won't get a
    chance to go over in class. The exercises are, at times, open
    ended and deliberately vague.  They're not busy work. I think it's
    important to approach labs with this in mind. Don't try to rush
    through; if you put a little extra time and thought into the labs
    you'll get much more out of them.  Also, sometimes labs may be
    puzzles or exploratory word problems. 

</ol>
</p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>You learn math and physics (or anything, really) by
    practicing</p>
  <h2>Stuff about Homework</h2>
</header>
<p>
  <ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    math, and also this is most of what
    your evaluation will be based on.</li>
  <li>As discussed in <a href="https://youtu.be/xxv-Sxav1qQ">this
  video</a> there will be two parts to almost every homework
    assignment:
    <ul>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on Edfinity</li>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	google classroom</li>
  </ul></li>
  
  <li>Edfinity is an online homework system. I use this system even
    when the world is not in a global pandemic.  There are three reasons 
    why I use Edfinity:
    <ul>
      <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	many times until you get everything correct.</li>
      <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	final answer. </li>
      <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	grading.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the first
    time. Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I strongly suggest working
    with others and seeking help if you need it.  
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email/google classroom, it is important that you
    check your email/classroom regularly.</li>
  <li>I anticipate that there will be two exams: one around week six
    and the other during the last week of the term. These exams will be
    open-notes and (essentially) untimed.</li>
  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a scientific calculator or 
    phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
    not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
    ever). </li>
  </ol>
</p>




<header class="align-center">
  <p>you can get help, and a lot more, at help sessions</p>
  <h2>Help Sessions</h2>
</header>
<p>
The Teaching Assistants and I will have a handful of help sessions
every week. <b>I do not know yet where the help sessions will be.
    Probably in room 103 in the new building.  I might also do one or
    two help sessions on zoom in the evening.</b>
You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
Things that happen at help sessions:

<ol>
  <li>The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Other students do the problems at home or in the library and
    come to the help session with specific questions. </li>
  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.</li>
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also wander into other areas: politics,
    the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes are
    offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions will
help you do well in the class and get as much out of it as
possible.</p>  


<header class="align-center">
  <p>there are lots of good reasons why you might want to meet with me
    one-on-one</p>
  <h2>Individual Meetings</h2>
</header>
I am happy to meet with students one-on-one, either via zoom or in
person.  The best way to set up an appointment is to send me an email.
There are lots of reasons why you might want to meet with me: 
<ol>
  <li>You have some in-depth questions that there isn't time to
    explore in a help session.
  <li>You have a question that you think is too basic or you're
  uncomfortable asking in a help session.  (You shouldn't be
  uncomfortable, since, as the saying goes, there are no dumb
  questions!  But I understand that you might be uncomfortable
  nevertheless.)
  <li>You want to discuss some challenges you're facing in the class.
  <li>You want to talk about other classes in physics or math, or
    internships, senior projects, etc.
</ol>  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything you want to
discuss. </p>

<header class="align-center">
  <p>Everyone is welcome</p>
  <h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
</header>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown, or Dean of
  Students Sarah Luke.
</p>



<header class="align-center">
  <p>Some fine print</p>
  <h2>Statements about Academic Honesty and Hours of Academic
    Engagement</h3>
</header>
<li> I am required to remind you that: "By enrolling in an academic
  institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of
  academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or
  fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must
  make it his or her responsibility to not use words or works of
  others without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and
  evidence of such activity is reported to the academic dean or
  his/her designee.  Two violations of academic integrity are grounds
  for dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
  discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
  scholarship arise."
  
<li>You should expect to spend 150 hours of academically engaged time
  on this course, or 15 hours per week. In addition to 5.5 hours per
  week in class or discussion section, in a typical week you'll spend
  1.5 hours reading and preparing for class and 8 hours attending
  help sessions and completing assignments.
