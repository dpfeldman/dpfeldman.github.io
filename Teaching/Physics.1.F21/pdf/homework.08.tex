\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

%\hspace{2mm}\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: Edfinity}.  Do Homework 08 which you will find
on your edfinity account.  Note that {\bf there is only one edfinity
  part for Homework 08.}  In particular, there are no edfinity
problems for Chapter N03.  I recommend doing the edfinity part of the
homework first.  This will enable you to benefit edfinity's instant
feedback before you do part two.\\  


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  over 45 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
  is challenging.)\\
