<h3>Textbook</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">We will
  use <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/StrangeQM/">The
  Strange World of Quantum Mechanics</a>
  by <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/index.html">Dan
  Styer</a>.  We'll cover about half of this book.  I will also send
  out many articles and book chapters and the like.  </p>

<!--<p class="no-box">We will also make use
  of Spins
  and Quantum Measurement. This is a short book written by
  Professor <a href="http://www.physics.orst.edu/~mcintyre/">David 
  McIntyre</a>. These materials have been developed
  for <a href="http://www.physics.oregonstate.edu/paradigms/CourseFiles/paradigmscourseinfo.php?course=ph425">
  Spins and Quantum Measurement</a>, an innovative course offered at
  Oregon State University for physics majors. I'll give you
  photocopies of these in a few weeks. 
</p>

<p class="no-box">I also recommend getting a copy
  of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Quantum-Theory-Sciences-Discovery/dp/1840468505/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1268162828&sr=1-1">Introducing
    Quantum Theory: A Graphic Guide to Science's Most Puzzling
    Discovery</a> by J.P. McEvoy and Oscar Zarate. 
This is a graphic-novel/cartoon book covering the history and basic
ideas of quantum mechanics.  It's fun and it's one of the best
introductions and overviews of quantum mechanics that I've seen.  I'll
assign reading from this book very occasionally.  So you can certainly
  get by without owning a copy.  <!--On the other hand, I think this
  little book could be a great companion for the course and it is very
  reasonably priced.  

<p class="no-box">We will also read a handful of photocopied
  articles and essays.</p>
-->


<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>


<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 60 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Discussion Participation:</b> 20 percent.
</ul>


<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 


<h3>Class Structure and Policies</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li> The final version of this and related documents can be found on
  the course web page. 

<li> Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on
  Friday. More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result
  in me mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade. 

<li> If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
  assignments, it's not a big deal. But be very careful to not fall
  farther behind every week. 

<li> I will accept late homework assignments. However, I may not be
  able to grade these assignment thoroughly. I'll check off that you
  did it, but I might not have time to make as many comments and
  suggestions as I normally do.  

<li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
  no higher than a C. 

<li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You can
  also consult me, other faculty, friends, and
  family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
  understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
  problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
  photocopy their solution and turn it in. 

<!--<li>You will do some sort of a final project.  It could be a
  synthetic final problem set, a final paper, or something else.  I'm
  pretty flexible as to the format and topic.  We will discuss this
  sometime around week three. -->

<li> As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
  information via email, it is important that you check your email
  regularly. 

<li> Unless we have made prior arrangements, I expect you to attend
  class.  

<li> Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagiarizing, etc. -- is bad. Any
  cases of academic misconduct will likely result in a judicial
  hearing; see the academic handbook for details. Possible
  consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion. 

<li> A more informal description of the course can be found <a
  href="./description.html">here</a>. 

</ol>


<h3>Hours of Academic Engagement</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">
You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically engaged hours
associated with this one-credit course. These 150 hours will be spent
roughly as follows: 3 hr/wk in class, 1.5 hr/wk in discussion section,
3 hr/wk reading and preparing for class discussions, 4.5 hr/wk on
homework, and 3 hr/wk on your final project.
