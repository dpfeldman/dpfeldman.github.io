<h2 align=center>Toward a Quantitative Human Ecology of Soup Cans</h2>


<ol>
<li>Cylindrical soup cans are to be made to hold a fixed volume V.
To save resources, you need would like to design a can that will hold
V, but will use the least metal.  What is the ratio of the radius to
the height for the can that uses the least metal? (We've already done
  this problem in class.)<p>


<li>Cylindrical soup cans are to be manufactured to hold a fixed volume V.
There is no waste in cutting the metal for the sides of the can, but
the circular endpieces will be cut from a square, with the corners
wasted.  Find the ratio of the radius to the height for the most
economical can.  Is your answer bigger or smaller than your answer for
part 1?  Explain.  <p>

<li>Suppose that you don't need to worry about the wasted corners any
more; you've convinced the plant operators that you should save the
corners and remelt them and use them again.  So they're not really
wasted.  However, your engineers tell you that for better stability,
you'll need make the top and the bottom of the cylinder three times as
thick as the sides.  Find the ratio of the radius to the height for
the can that uses the least material.  Is your answer bigger or
smaller than your answer for part 1?  Explain. <p>

<li>Suppose you want to break with tradition and make your soup cans
conical instead of cylindrical.  Find the ratio of the radius to the
height for the cone that holds a fixed volume V but uses the least
material. <p> 

<!--<li>How much material does the box in problem 4 use?  How much
material does the cylinder from problem 1 use?  You should find that
the box uses less material.  Given this, why aren't soup cans
typically shaped like boxes? <p>-->


<li>  Now suppose that the soup can material costs C1 per
square centimeter.  Also, assume a cost C2 per centimeter of "seam"
along the top and bottom of the cylindrical can.  Find the ratio of
the radius to the height for the least expensive can.  You will
  probably want to use Maple for this.  Discuss your result. Does the
  ratio change as you would expect if C1 and C2 are changed?
<!-- It's relatively
straightforward to get the derivative of the cost.  The hard part is
finding the r that makes the derivative equal to zero.  When I did it
I ended up with a cubic equation which I had to give to Maple to
solve.-->  <p>

<li> (<b>Optional:</b>) You now need to build a structure to hold your
  soup cans before the truck comes to take them to natural food stores
  and co-ops.  Not having taken any architecture classes, you decide
  on a very simple design:  a large piece of metal folded down the
  middle to form a long V.  This V will then form a long triangular
  shelter for your soup cans.  (To visualize this shape, take a piece
  of paper and fold it in half.  Unfold it and stand it up on its
  ends.) How should you fold the metal so that your shelter will be
  able to hold the most soup cans?  I.e., you want to maximize the
  volume of the building.  Assume that the length of your metal before
  folding is L and the width is W.  
(<i>Hint:  There are many ways to solve this problem.  I think the
easiest is to express the volume of the structure in terms of the
angle of folding.  Then take the derivative of V with respect to this
angle and minimize.</i>) <p>
