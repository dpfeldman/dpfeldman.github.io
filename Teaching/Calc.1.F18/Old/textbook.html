Our textbook will be:<p>

<i>
Deborah Hughes-Hallett, et al.
Calculus: Single Variable, 4th Edition.  J. Wiley.  November 2004.
ISBN-10: 0471484822
ISBN-13: 978-0471484820
</i>

<p>This book list for $123.84 on amazon.com.  It will probably be a little
bit more expensive from Sherman's in Bar Harbor.  There are some less
expensive options, however:

<ol>
<li>Get it used at a bookstore somewhere.  This text is used at many US
universities.  So you should be able to find it used at other college
bookstores.  If you live in (or will be going to) a town with a college
or university, you may want to explore this option.

<li>But it used online.  Amazon has it used for as little as $40.  There
are other places you can look for it online, too.  

<li> Try to buy it from a current student.  This is the same edition that
I used the last time I offered the course.
</ol>

<p>I strongly recommend buying your own copy of the textbook.  The book is
overpriced, but nevertheless I think you'll learn more if you get your
own copy.  We will use the same textbook for Calc II in winter.  

<p>
Whatever you end up deciding to do, please be very, very careful that
you're getting the right book.  There are several different versions and
editions of Calculus textbooks by the same author.  When buying books
with different editions, the best thing to do is look for the ISBN code.
If the ISBN matches the one given above, then you have the right book.
Every edition of a book gets a new ISBN, so an ISBN is a unique
identifier for a book.  (There are two version of ISBNs now: 10 and 13
digit codes.  Either will work.  You can learn lots more
about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isbn">ISBNs on
wikipedia</a>, should you have some time on your hands.  There's actually
some interesting math involved.)
