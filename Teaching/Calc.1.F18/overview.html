<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>I want to help you improve your problem  
    solving skills and mathematical confidence.  More generally, I
    want you to leave this course with an increased ability to
    <i>do</i> mathematics.
    <li>I want you to gain a firm, enduring understanding of two of
    the big ideas of calculus: the limit and the derivative.  
    <li>I want you to be able to correctly perform
    mechanical calculations using the course content, apply problem
    solving skills to new areas, and
    effectively communicate problem solving strategies in writing. 
    <li>I want you to have fun while learning a lot.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>
As our primary text we will use <i>Calculus</i>, fourth edition, by
Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. Be sure you have the right edition of
the book.  <a href="./textbook.html">Here</a> is more information
about the text.  We will cover most of chapters 1-4.  
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 70 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>
</p><p>
I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
put forth in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.  I recommend against letter grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine learning.  But I also
understand that many students believe (perhaps correctly) that grades
will make it easier to get into graduate or professional school.
</p>


<h3>Policies and Details</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>

<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page.

<li>Homework will usually be due at the end of the day on Friday.
  More than one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me
  mentioning this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a
  lowering of your grade.   

<li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework assignments,
  it's not a big deal.  But be very careful to not fall farther behind
  every week. 

<li>I will accept late homework assignments.  However, I may not be
  able to grade these assignments thoroughly.  This means they will be
  of less use to you on exams.  Also, you may not receive full credit
  for assignments that are full credit for them, especially if they
  significantly late. 

<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.

<li>There will be one midterm and one final exam.  Both tests will be
    open notes, open book, and (essentially) untimed.  You may not,
    however, get any help from any humans during the exam. 

<li>From time to time I will make short videos that will supplement
  what we cover in class.  Upon occasion, I may ask you to watch a
  video <i>before</i> class. 

<!--<li> Most weeks will we have a short lab session in the Gower
  classroom. The purpose of these labs are to familiarize you with the
  computer
  program/website <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">wolframalpha.com</a>,
  a tremendously useful resource for learning and doing math and science.
  There will be short exercises that you will do during  
  lab and hand in.  Mostly I will just check off that you've done the
  exercises. 
-->

<li>You will want to have at your disposal a calculator that has trig
  functions, logs, and scientific notation.  You do not need a
  graphing calculator for this course. 

<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  

<li> The TAs and I will have some regular hours, and you should also
  feel free to contact us to find a time to meet.  

<li>Please try to limit electronic distractions during class (texting,
  facebooking, etc.).   I don't really mind if you don't pay attention,
  but students sometimes report finding it distracting when others
  around them are busy with facebook, email, texts, and so on.  I
  strongly suggest reading Clay
  Shirkey's <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.286d6yblg">excellent
  essay</a> about digital distractions. 

  <li> By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
    subscribing to common standards of academic honesty. Any cheating,
    plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a breach of such
    standards. A student must make it his or her responsibility to not
    use words or works of others without proper
    acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence of such
    activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her designee. Two
    violations of academic integrity are grounds for dismissal from
    the college. Students should request in-class discussions of such
    questions when complex issues of ethical scholarship arise. 
    consequences range from failure of the assignment to expulsion.

<li>In addition to the 3 hours of scheduled class time every week, I
  expect that between readings, going over notes, and doing
  assignments you will spend at least an additional 12 hours a week on
  this course, for a total of at least 150 hours over the term devoted
  to this class.
