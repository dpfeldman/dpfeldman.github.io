<h3>Labs</h3><br>
<ol>
<p class="no-box">


   <li> <a href="Labs/lab.1.pdf">Lab one</a>, Tuesday 14
   September, 2011.


</ol>

<p class="no-box">
<ul>
    <li> Failing to attend labs will negatively affect your course grade
    and evaluation. Labs are an important (and I hope fun) part of the
    course. We will learn skills here that you won't get a chance to
    practice in homework or discuss much in class. <br><br>

    <li> The lab participation portion of your evaluation will be based
    on the 
    degree with which you engage the
    material and the level of cooperation with your lab partners. I'm
    not that interested in "right" answers. In fact, my aim will be to
    sometime give you puzzles that you hopefully won't get right
    away. You can learn from mistakes. <!--If I give you things you
    already know how to do, there's not as much of an opportunity to
    learn. --><br><br>

    <li> You won't always be following a strict recipe. Instead, you'll
    be led through some exercises, demonstrate some physical
    principles for yourself, and be asked to draw conclusions. I think
    this lab set-up is better than the more standard "cookbook"
    approach. However, it probably requires more active participation
    on the part of students. <br><br>

    <li> Additionally, labs will give us an opportunity to try out some
    of the situations discussed in the textbook. <br><br>

    <li> After completing the lab, your group should check in with me
      or one of the TAs.  We will quickly look over your work and may
      ask you a few questions.  There usually will not be anything to
      hand in. <br><br>
    <!--hand in a sheet with
    your calculations and observations. I will look over the lab
    "report", assign some sort of a grade (check plus, check, check
    minus), and hand it back to you. -->

    <li>Typical labs will be around 1.5 hours. <br><br>

    <!--<li> Lab work will not spawn a significant amount of work beyond the
    two to three hours we spend together. -->

    <li> Sometime around week 7 there may be a "micro project" instead of
    a lab. This will be a group investigation of one of several
    energy-related things.
