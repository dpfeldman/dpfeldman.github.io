<h3>Informal Description</h3><br>
<ol>
<p class="no-box">

    <li> This class is fairly big.  <!--Also, the TA situation for this
    class will be a little unsettled initially, as two of the TAs are
    also TAing for another class.-->  You and I will need to work
    together creatively to make sure that this classtime is
    comfortable and effective, and that outside of class people are
    able to get all the help they need. 

    <li> There will be times in class when we go over something that
    you already understand. There may also occasionally be times when
    you feel lost in class for a little bit. If this happens, don't
    despair. Ask a question or talk to me or one of the TAs after
    class. 

    <li> Falling behind in this course is not a good idea. If you're
    confused about something, it's very important that you seek help
    sooner rather than later. This course builds on itself&mdash;what we do
    in week three will depend on what we did in week two, what we do
    in week four depends on week three, etc. There are many people
    around who can offer help. However, we can't offer assistance if
    we don't know who needs it when. You need to take responsibility
    to seek help if you need it. On a related note ... 

    <li> I do not expect all of the homework assignments to be easy; I
    don't expect you to be able to sit down and do them easily the
    first time. Don't let yourself get frustrated&mdash;I strongly suggest
    working with others and seeking help if you need it. I also
    strongly suggest that you start the homework well before it's
    due. 

    <li> In many more traditional math and physics classes the
    textbook has a ton of examples in them. The book we'll be using
    doesn't. The result is that students sometimes find the homework
    to be challenging, frustrating, and occasionally even
    annoying. However, I'm convinced that this style of homework&mdash;where
    there's not an example just like the problem you're trying to
    do&mdash;is much better pedagogically. You'll learn a lot more this
    way. 

    <li> This course covers fairly standard Physics I material. The
    only exception to this is that our book begins with conservation
    laws, and leaves Newton's laws for later. There are a few other
    texts that do this, but most do it the other way around. The text
    book we're using is used at many other colleges and universities
    in the U.S. If you've had Physics before, in high school or at
    another college, you'll probably find most of the material
    familiar. You should talk with me to make sure that this course
    won't be too much review for you. 

    <li> This class is listed as an introductory course. I do not
    assume that you've had physics before. Although our textbooks
    occasionally use calculus, calculus is most definitely not a
    prerequisite for this class. This class makes extensive use of
    algebra and trigonometry. If you've never had trig before, you can
    still take this class, but you might have some extra work you'll
    need to do the first few weeks. In the past, students without a
    trig background have taken this class and done fine. 

    <li> This class is a lot of work. However, the workload is steady;
    you'll be doing approximately the same amount of work each
    week. We'll hit the ground running and try to get lots of stuff
    done the next few weeks. The workload will taper off some toward
    the end of the term. 

    <li>The workload in this class starts off heavier and increases in
    difficulty and amount the first several weeks.  After around week
    three and chapter C5 things will level off and perhaps even get
    easier. 

    <li> Labs in this class may be different than those you've
    encountered in other science classes. There will not be a formal
    write-up, aka a "lab report", due at the end of the lab. Instead,
    the emphasis is on playing/experimenting with some equipment,
    trying some stuff out, and learning some skills we won't get a
    chance to go over in class. The exercises are, at times, open
    ended and deliberately vague. But there's a point to each; every
    exercise is designed with some clear purpose. They're not just
    busy work. I think it's important to approach labs with this in
    mind. Don't try to rush through; if you put a little extra time
    and thought into the labs you'll get much more out of them.
