<h3>Textbook</h3>
<br>
<p class="no-box">As our primary text we will use the Six Ideas books
  by Tom Moore. I would like to cover all of unit C and about a
  quarter of unit N.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Thomas A. Moore. Six Ideas that Shaped Physics: Unit C:
    Conservation Laws Constrain Interactions, second edition. McGraw
    Hill. 2003. ISBN: 0-07-229152-4. 
    <li> Thomas A. Moore. Six Ideas that Shaped Physics: Unit N: The
    Laws of Physics are Universal, second edition. McGraw
    Hill. 2003. ISBN: 0-07-239712-8.  
</ol>

<p class="no-box">Important Note: Be sure to get the second edition of
    the text. If you're purchasing the book online, be sure to check
    the ISBN. This is the most reliable way to see what edition of a
    book you're getting; each edition has a unique ISBN. 
</p>


<h3>Evaluation</h3><br>


<p class="no-box">Your evaluation will be loosely based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 55 percent.
<li><b>Mid-Term Exam:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 20 percent.
<li><b>Class and Lab Participation:</b> 10 percent.
</ul>


<p class="no-box">I recommend against grades; I believe they are more
likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective learning.
However, I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc. </p> 

<h3>Policies and Stuff</h3>
<p class="no-box">
<ol>
   <li> Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day. More than
   one unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning
   this in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of
   your grade. 
   <li> I will be leaving the country roughly one week after the term
   ends, and so I will be grading and writing evaluations right after
   the end of the term.  So it is important that have all your work
   completed at the end of week ten.  I will only grant extensions 
   <li> You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework. You
   can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends, and
   family. However, the homework you hand in should represent your own
   understanding. This means that if your friends get a homework
   problem and you don't understand how they did it, you shouldn't
   photocopy their solution and turn it in. 
   <li> Exams will be open notes, open book, and (essentially)
   untimed. You may not, however, get any help from any humans during
   the exam. 
   <li> I will almost always assign reading for each class. You should
   do the reading. I strongly recommend reading over the chapter
   before class and being prepared with questions and comments. 
   <li> More than two missing homework assignments will result in a
   grade no higher than a C. 
   <li> You'll want a calculator that can handle scientific notation,
   trigonometry, and logarithms. There's no need to buy an expensive
   graphing calculator. 
   <li> I expect you to attend labs.
   <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
   important that you check your email. 
   <li> Academic misconduct&mdash;cheating, plagarizing, etc.&mdash;is
  bad. Any cases of academic misconduct may result in a judicial
  hearing.  Possible consequences range from failure of the assignment
  to expulsion.
