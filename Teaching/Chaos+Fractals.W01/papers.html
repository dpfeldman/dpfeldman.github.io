<h1 align=center> Intro to Chaos and Fractals:  Short Papers</h1><p>
<p>
<br>

<b>The first paper will be due Monday 22 January.</b><p>

Here are some guidelines for the short papers.

<ul>
<li>Response papers should be around two pages in length.
<li>Response papers should be in the style of a well-developed journal
entry.  You do not need to come to any grand conclusion.  It's fine to
raise more questions than you answer.
<li>The audience you should probably have in mind while writing is:
you, me, and the rest of the people in the class.
<li>I strongly recommend writing in the first person.
<li>I'm looking for evidence of critical thought, not a summary of the
reading.  
<li>Your paper should be typed or word-processed.  
<li>Explore one or at most two ideas.
<li>Write about something that interests you.  
<li>Your writing should be clear; use "correct" usage.  Grammar and
overall clarity will be part of your evaluation.  The writing can be
quite informal, but should still read ok.
<li>Please hand in your papers on time.  If papers are late, I'll
mention this on your narrative evaluation.  If you need extra time,
let me know.
<li> You can always re-write one of your papers.
<li> Working with a writing tutor is strongly recommended.  Rita and
Jen are/were writing tutors, and are both familiar with the topics and
themes of this course.
