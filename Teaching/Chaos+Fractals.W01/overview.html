<h3>Course Overview
</h3>

I have several goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to gain a solid understanding of the basic mathematical
ideas behind chaos and fractals. 

<li>I want to help you improve your quantitative literacy, problem
solving skills, and mathematical confidence.  

<li>I want you to gain a sense of how math and physics is done, and
gain an awareness that these are not static, "dead" disciplines.


</ol>
<p>

<b>Textual Materials:</b> We will read <i>Chaos: Making a New
Science</i> by James Gleick.  This is a "popular science" book and is
not a traditional text.  For more mathy information, we will use a
number of worksheets and handouts developed by <a
href="http://math.bu.edu/people/bob">Bob Devaney</a> and co-workers.
I will hand these out in class.  
<p><br>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Weekly Homework Assignments:</b> 45 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 25 percent.
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 15 percent.
<li><b>Short Papers:</b> 15 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the
guidelines in the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's,
B's, etc.<p><br>  

<h3>Policies and Stuff: First Draft</h3>

<ol>
<li>The final version of this and related documents can be found on
the course web page, <a
href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.W01"> http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/Teaching/Chaos+Fractals.W01</a>.
<li>Homework will be due Fridays at the end of the day.  More than one
unexcused late homework assignment will result in me mentioning this
in your narrative evaluation and may result in a lowering of your
grade.   
<li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.  This means that if your friends get a
    homework problem and you don't understand how they did it,
    you shouldn't photocopy their solution and turn it in.
<li>There will be no exams.  However, there may be a large-ish,
synthetic assignment toward the end of the term.
<li>Collaborating with two other students, you will do a final
project.  Your group will give a presentation of around 45 minutes
towards the end of the term.  Your group should also produce something
tangible -- i.e. a paper, some artwork, or a scientific poster.  For 
more info, see the <a href="final.guidelines.html">project 
guidelines</a> and a <a href="final.ideas.html">list of possible
project topics</a>. 
<li> I will almost always assign reading for each class.  You should
    do the reading, and come prepared with some questions or areas that
    you want to discuss.
<li>You will write three short (2 page) papers exploring ideas from
    the book by Gleick.  Information about what's expected for the short
    papers can be found <a href="papers.html">here</a>.
<li> We will probably need to schedule an extra class or two during
weeks 9 or 10 so we have enough time for the presentations.   
<li>More than two missing homework assignments will result in a grade
    no higher than a C.  
<li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email, it is important that you check your email
    regularly.  Also, you will need to use the www for some of your
    assignments.  
<li>I expect you to attend class.  
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
<li><b>For more, see a list of <a href="expectations.html">what to
expect</a></b>.
