\noindent There are two parts to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework2 04 and 04B which you will find 
on your \href{https://webwork.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es3028m-winter-2022/}{WeBWorK account}.\\
%I recommend doing the edfinity part of the
%homework first.  This will enable you to benefit edfinity's instant
%feedback before you do part two.\\


\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
  There is no need to type of this assignment.
\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
  around 45 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email 
  is challenging.)
\end{itemize}
