\noindent There is just one part to this assignment.\\

\noindent {\bf Part 1: WeBWorK}.  Do Homework 01 which you will find
on your \href{https://webwork.runestone.academy/webwork2/coa-feldman-es3028m-winter-2022/}{WeBWorK account}.\\
%I recommend doing the edfinity part of the
%homework first.  This will enable you to benefit edfinity's instant
%feedback before you do part two.\\


%\noindent {\bf Part 2: Problems from the Textbook}.  Here are some
%instructions for how to submit this part of the assignment.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Do the problems by hand using pencil (or pen) and paper.
%  There is no need to type of this assignment.
%\item Make a pdf scan of your work using genius scan or some
%  similar scanning app.  Please make the homework into a single
%  pdf, not multiple pdfs.
%\item Submit the assignment on google classroom.  Please don't
%  email it to me.  (Between my two classes I will be receiving
%  around 30 assignments a week.  Keeping track of them all in email
%  is challenging.)
