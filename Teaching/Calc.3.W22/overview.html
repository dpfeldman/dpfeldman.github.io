<!--<blockquote>
      I would...urge that people be introduced to [chaos] early in
      their mathematical education. [Chaos] can be studied
      phenomenologically by iterating it on a calculator, or even by
      hand. Its study does not involve as much conceptual
      sophistication as does elementary calculus. Such study would
      greatly enrich the student's intuition. Not only in research,
      but also in the everyday world of politics and economics, we
      would all be better off if more people realised that simple
      nonlinear systems do not necessarily possess simple dynamical
      properties.

<h3>Text</h3>
<p>
  We will use the book Guadalupe Lonzano, et al. <i>Calculus:
  Multivariable, 5th Edition.</i> J. Wiley. 2008. ISBN:
  978-0-470-13158-9. I have purchased copies for you. You won't need
  to buy a copy.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p class="no-box">
Your evaluation will be based on weekly homework assignments. There
will be two parts to these assignments: problems from the text that
you'll write up, scan, and upload to google classroom; and problems
from WeBWorK that you'll do online. </p> 

<!--<p class="no-box">In general, I recommend against grades; I believe
they are more likely than not to interfere with genuine, reflective
learning.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc. </p> -->
  

<h3>Course Structure and Flow</h3>

<p>This is the tenth(!) time I've taught this course, so on the
  one hand I have a very good feel for how this will go. But we are
  still in a pandemic, so nothing it quite normal.</p>

<ul>

<li>Most students find the material in Calculus III to be less
  difficult and more interesting that that of Calculus I and
  II. Calculus III basically re-does all of calculus, except with
  functions of two or three variables instead of just one variable. In
  the last third of the class we re-re-do calculus for vector
  fields. This means that along the way we will review and re-affirm
  concepts and techniques from the first two terms of calculus.</li>
<li>Students who take this class should have had roughly a full year
  (or two college terms) of calculus. It is important that you've seen
  both differential and integral calculus and felt like you understood
  these topics reasonably well at some point. If you feel like you've
  forgotten a lot of calculus, that's ok.</li>

<li>This class is a lot of work and will move at a fairly brisk
  pace. However, the workload is steady; you'll be doing approximately
  the same amount of work each week. We'll hit the ground running and
  try to get lots of stuff done the next few weeks. The workload may
  taper off some toward the end of the term, although the material at
  the end might be a bit more difficult.</li> 

<li>This class meets three times a week instead of the usual two. The
  Wednesday meeting is a normal class session, not a lab. This extra
  time will let us cover more material and have classtime be a bit
  more relaxed.</li>  

<li> Our textbook emphasizes graphical and verbal understanding in
  addition to being able to work with symbols and numbers. Much of
  mathematics -- both theory and application -- is graphical or
  geometrical in nature. The graphical problems are not "lite"
  problems but are an essential part of the course. The graphical
  problems are most definitely "real math." Some of you may find
  graphical work difficult, as it's likely different than some of what
  you've been asked to do in math classes before. </li>


</ul>

<h3>Some Additional Details and Logistics</h3>

<p><ol>
  <li>This class fulfills the <b>QR</b> requirement.</li>
  <li>Homework will usually be due Fridays at the end of the day. If
    you need extra time on the assignments, that's fine, but please
    let me know.</li>
  <li> I will be sending out class info via email. Thus, it's
  important that you check your email. </li> 
</ol></p>



<h3>Homework!</h3>
<p class="no-box">

<ol>
  <li>There will be a homework assignment due almost every Friday. It is 
    essential that you do these assignments, as this is how one learns
    math, and also this is what your evaluation will be based on.</li> 
  <li>As discussed in <a href="https://youtu.be/iteUqErz2jU">this
  video</a> there will be two parts to almost every homework
    assignment:
    <ol>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on WeBWorK</li>
      <li>Problems to be submitted on "paper" (a scanned pdf) on
	google classroom</li>
    </ol>
  <li>WeBWorK is an online homework system. I use this system even
    when the world is not in a global pandemic.  There are three reasons 
    why I use WeBWorK:
    <ol>
      <li>You get instant feedback while doing the work, so you can
	learn right away from your mistakes. You can submit solutions
	many times until you get everything correct.</li>
      <li>Some problems are randomized so that you will all get
	slightly different versions of the questions. This means that
	collaborating with other students will be maximally effective,
	since you'll have to share solution methods and not just the
	final answer. </li>
      <li>Since the problems are automatically marked, I can spend
      more time helping you and won't have to spend as much time
	grading.</li>
      </ol></li>
  <li>If you need extra time for one or two of the homework
    assignments, it's not a big deal.  But be mindful to not fall
    farther behind every week. </li>
  <li>I expect the homework assignments to be productively
    challenging. The assignments will vary in length, difficulty, and
    style. I don't expect you to be able to complete the homework
    quickly in one sitting.  Don't let yourself get frustrated.  I
    strongly suggest working with others and seeking help if you need
    it.</li> 
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to work together on homework.  You
    can also consult me, class tutors, other faculty, friends,
    and family.  However, the homework you hand in should represent
    your own understanding.</li>
  <li>As I plan on sending out homework assignments and other
    information via email classroom, it is important that you
    check your email regularly.</li>
  <li>You will want to have at your disposal a basic calculator or 
    phone/tablet app.  I strongly suggest an actual calculator.  You do
    not need a graphing calculator for this course (or, in my opinion,
    ever). </li>
  </ol>
  
</p>


<h3>Help Sessions</h3>
<p>
I will have a handful of help sessions
every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these
sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun.
Things that happen at help sessions: 
<ol>
  <li>I am around to offer help on the homework.</li>
  <li>Some students do most of the homework while at a help
    session.  They work through problems alone or with others, and
    find it comforting to know that help is immediately at hand if
    needed.</li>
  <li>Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with 
    specific questions.</li>
<!--  <li>We can experiment with breakout rooms for folks who want to work
  together in small groups during the help session.</li>-->
<!--  <li>Usually there are a group of students working together at one or
    two tables in the dining hall.  You can join this group.
  <li>Some students prefer working in booths, which can be a bit
    quieter.  I'll wander over to the booths and check in on students,
    or you can move over to the large table or summon me over.-->
  <li>Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about
    the course.  Conversations also sometimes wander into other areas:
    politics, the state of the world, what's for dinner, what classes
    are offered next term, and so on.</li>
  <li>Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the
    class.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <b>there are no Teaching Assistants for this
    class</b>. So it's just me. This means that it will be important
    for you to work in groups and help each other. As much as I'd like
    to, I probably won't be able to provide one-on-one help to
    everyone. We could set up a discussion board or a slack channel
    or something for the class if that would be helpful.</p> 

  
<p>Everyone is welcome at help sessions!  Attending these sessions help
students do well in the class and get as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>You should also feel free to reach out to me with questions. If
  you're stuck on a problem, it might help to take a photo of what
  you've done so far and include it in an email to us. We might be
  able to help you with a short email, or we could set up a time to
  meet, perhaps on zoom.</p> 

<p>Also, you can summon help via email from within WeBWorK.  If you do
  so, I get an email and a link to your version of the WeBWorK
  problem, and I can see all the answers you've submitted.  Usually I
  can see what's going on and quickly offer some help.  Sometimes
  it'll be an issue that doesn't lend itself to email, in which case
  we find a time to meet and go over it.</p>
      

<h3>Electronic Distractions</h3>
<p>
As much as possible, I'd like to minimize the use of laptops, tablets,
and phones during our class meetings.  There is good evidence that
these wonderful devices can harm the learning environment, even
for those who are not using their own devices and are merely exposed
to the devices of others.  An excellent, reasoned discussion of this
is 
<a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.vg0jdax0x">Why
  I Just Asked My Students To Put Their Laptops Away</a>
  by <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>.  I highly
  recommend giving his essay a read.</p>

<p class="no-box">There is no need to ban laptops entirely&mdash;that
  just seems 
  silly to me.  There will be times in class when we will do exercises
  that require computers, and there will also be moments when we might
  want to grab a device and look up the meaning of a word or a
  historical tidbit or something.  So let's use common sense and keep
  devices holstered except when they're needed, at which point we
  should use them proudly and without apology.</p>


<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>It is my intent that students from all
  backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,
  that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class,
  and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed
  as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present
  materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender,
  sexuality, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status,
  ethnicity, race, and culture.</p>

<p>Learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing
  process. I am always looking to learn more about power and privilege
  and the harmful effects of racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and
  other forms of discrimination and oppression.  Your suggestions are
  encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to
  improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for
  other students or student groups. If something was said or done in
  class (by anyone, including me) that made you feel uncomfortable,
  please talk to me about it.  You can also reach out to Provost Ken
  Hill, or Associate Deans Bonnie Tai or Jamie McKown.
</p>
  

<h3>Standard Disclaimers</h3>
<p class="no-box">
  <ul>
    <li>You should expect to spend a minimum of 150 academically
      engaged hours associated with this one-credit course. These
      150 hours will be spent roughly as follows: 4.5 hr/wk "in" class,
      2 hr/wk reading, 8.5 hr/wk on homework.
    <li>By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is
      subscribing to common standards of academic honesty.  Any
      cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a
      breach of such standards. A student must make it his or her
      responsibility to not use words or works of others without
      proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence
      of such activity is reported to the academic dean or his/her
      designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for
      dismissal from the college. Students should request in-class
      discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical
      scholarship arise.
