<b>Homework 5:  Due Monday February 15 at 8PM.</b>  Note, for many of
the problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it
still might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning. <p>

<ul>
<li><b>Section 2.4:</b>
<ol>
<li> 1.  (5 points)  Explain your answer.
<li> 14.  (10 points).
</ol><p>

<li><b>Section 2.5  :</b><ol>
<li> 2,4,6.  (5 points total)  No explanations necessary.
<li> 13.  (10 points)  No need for essays -- a few sentences will do. 
<li> 14.  (10 points)
<li> 16.  (10 points)  Note that the graph is of the derivative, not
the function.  
<li> 18.  (5 points)
</ol><p>

<li> <b>Section 3.1:</b>
<ol>
<li>2. (10 points)
<li>4. (10 points)
<li>6. (10 points)
<li>9.  (5 points)  Make sure your method is clear.
</ol><p>


<li> <b>Chapter 2 Review Problems, pp. 122-125:</b>
<ol>
<li> What topics from Chapter 2 were the most difficult for you?  What
do you feel you need more practice on?  Look over the review problems
and do some of them.  Do around "20 to 30 points worth" of work.  This
probably corresponds to 2 - 8 problems.
<li> Hand the review problems in separately; don't attach them to the
other homework.
<li> You will correct the review problems next week.  So give yourself
lots of room in which to write additional comments. 
<li>  This portion of this assignment is worth 20 points.  You will be
graded exclusively on effort.    
</ol><p>

<li><b>Bonus.</b> If you don't feel like you need review on chapter 2
(perhaps since you've had calculus before) you can do some bonus
problems instead.  (Of course, you're also welcome to do bonus
problems and review problems.)
<ol>
<li>Chapter 3.1, problem 8.  This integral comes up all the time in
statistics.  Do you recognize it?
<li>Project 1, page 126.  
<li>The focus on theory chapter on differentiability and linear
approximation looks quite good.  Local linearization is a very handy
thing to have a feel for -- we've used it a bunch in Physics II this
term.  Problems 11-13 on page 143 look especially good.
<li>There's lots of good material in the focus on theory section on
limits and continuity
<li>Refer back to problem 26 of section 1.10.  What length s (where s
is the side of a the square shaped end of the box) maximizes the
volume V? 
</ol>
<p>

<li> <b>Computer Problems:</b>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lab on Monday the 15th.  We'll learn how to make
the computer evaluate large sums for us.  None of this will be on HW6,
however. 
</ol><p>

</ul>
