<h1>Lab 1:  Fermi Problems </h1><p>
<p>
<br>

<b>Warm Up Exercises</b>:
<ol>
<li> Without using a calculator, convert the
following to scientific notation:
<ol>
<li>24,000,000.
<li>0.000070.
<li> Six Billion.
<li>Seven Hundred Trillion
<li>One one Thousandth.
</ol><p>

<li>What is the order of magnitude of the above numbers?
</ol>
<p><br>

<b> The Fun Stuff</b><p>
Each group should write up one solution to each problem.  The write up
can be quite informal.  However, it should be legible and, most
importantly, you should state your assumptions clearly.

<ol>

<li>Estimate the surface area of all the leaves on all the trees on
Mount Desert Island.  Compare this with the surface area of MDI.<p>

<li>You run a small non-profit that works to pressure small businesses
to conduct themselves in an environmentally sound way.  You have
recently learned that both barbers and piano tuners in New York City
are using a nasty chemical.  The barbers use it to clean their
scissors and the tuners use it on the metal piano wires.  (This is
completely fictitious.)  Your organization has very limited resources
and you can only afford to try to educate one group: barbers or piano
tuners.  Which should you try to contact?  Make order of magnitude
estimates of the number of barbers and the number of piano tuners in
New York City.<p>

<li>(Due to <a
href="http://galileo.harvard.edu/mazur-www/Whoswho/Eric_Mazur.html">Eric
Mazur</a>.)  On a Saturday afternoon, you pull into a
parking lot with unmetered spaces near a shopping area.  You circle
around, but there are no empty spots.  You decide to wait at one end
of the lot where you can see (and command) about 20 spaces.  How long
do you have to wait before someone frees up a space?
