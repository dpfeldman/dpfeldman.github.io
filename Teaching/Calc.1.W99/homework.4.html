<b>Homework 4:  Due Friday January 29 at 8PM.</b>  Note, for many of
the problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it
still might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning. <p>

<ul>
<li><b>Section 1.10:</b>
<ol>
<li> 4, 6, 10.  (15 points total).  Feel free to use a calculator or a
computer if you wish.  However, you should explain why the graphs look
the way they do.
<li> 18, 20, 22. (15 points total). 
<li> 24.  (10 points)
<li> 26.  (10 points)  
</ol><p>

<li><b>Section 1.11:</b><ol>
<li>2,4,6,8,10.  (10 points total)  No explanations necessary.
</ol><p>

<li> <b>Section 2.1:</b>
<ol>
<li>2, 4, 6, 8.  (20 points.)  No detailed explanations necessary.
You should, however, sketch a clear, large copy of the graph for your
own reference.  
<li> 10. (10 points)
<li> 14. (10 points)
<li> 18. (10 points)
</ol><p>


<li> <b>Chapter 1 Review Problems, pp. 70-75:</b>
<ol>
<li> What topics from Chapter 1 were the most difficult for you?  What
do you feel you need more practice on?  Look over the review problems
and do some of them.  Do around "20 to 30 points worth" of work.  This
probably corresponds to 2 - 8 problems.
<li> Hand the review problems in separately; don't attach them to the
other homework.
<li> You will correct the review problems next week.  So give yourself
lots of room in which to write additional comments. 
<li>  This portion of this assignment is worth 20 points.  You will be
graded exclusively on effort.    
</ol><p>


<li> <b>Computer Problems:</b>
<ol>
<li>Many of the problems this week ask for graphs.  Feel free to use a
calculator or computer to help you. 
</ol><p>

<li><b>Bonus.</b> 
<ol>
<li>Chapter 1, Focus on Theory, pp. 77 - 85 has some good stuff in
it.  The three subsections are independent of each other.
</ol>

</ul>
