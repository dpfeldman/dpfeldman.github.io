<b>Homework 5:  Due Monday January 8 at 8PM.</b>  Note, for many of
the problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it
still might be a good idea to show your work and/or explain your
reasoning. <p>

<ul>
<li><b>Section 2.2:</b>
<ol>
<li>  2, 4, 6, 8.  (20 points total).  Be sure your reasoning is
clearly shown.  
<li>  14, 16, 20.  (20 points total).  Do not use any "shortcuts" or
"rules" you may have learned in previous calc or pre-calc classes.
<li>  25.  (10 points).

<li> <b>Chapter 1 Review Problems, pp. 70-75:</b>

<li> Solutions for Chapter 1 Review Problems are on reserve at the
library.  Correct the review problems that you handed in last week.
Make comments on your paper in another color pen or pencil, or on a
separate sheet.  Make some notes to yourself on these problems that
you'll find helpful if you ever need to do these sorts of problems
again (perhaps on an exam.)  (20 points).
</ol><p>


<li> <b>Computer Problems:</b>
<ol>
<li>Many of the problems this week ask for graphs.  Feel free to use a
calculator or computer to help you. 
<li>On Monday in lab I will assign some lab exercises.  There will
just be one or two of these.  It is my hope that most of you will
finish these during the lab period.  
</ol><p>

<li><b>Bonus.</b> 
<ol>
<li>Chapter 2.3, problem 32.
<li>There's lots of good stuff in the chapter two focus on theory
sections.  If any of it looks interesting, I would be happy to discuss
it and pick a few problems to work through together.
</ol>

</ul>
