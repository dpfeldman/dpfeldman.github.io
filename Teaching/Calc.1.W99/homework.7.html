<b>Homework 7:  Due Monday February 22 at 8PM.</b>  Note, for many of
the problems for which I state that no explanation is necessary, it

Make comments on your paper in another color pen or pencil, or on a
separate sheet.  Make some notes to yourself on these problems that
you'll find helpful if you ever need to do these sorts of problems
again (perhaps on an exam.)  If you did one of the bonus problems, see
me and we can go over it, and/or I'll put the solutions in the library.
