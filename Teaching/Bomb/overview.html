<h3>Course Overview
</h3>
We will begin by reading <i>Making the Bomb</i>, by Richard Rhodes.  We will
then read another book or two, and/or some articles.  The direction we go
depends on the interests of the class and the themes that emerge during
our discussion of Rhodes' book.
<p>

I have three main goals for this course:<p>
<ol>
<li>I want you to learn some of the history behind the Manhattan
Project, including a qualitative understanding of some physics and
chemistry.
<li>I want you to gain experience thinking critically about science
and technology.
<li>I want you to gain a greater understanding of how the "institution"
of science "works".
</ol>
<p><br>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

Your evaluation will be based on the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Class Participation:</b> 30 percent.
<li><b>Journal and Related Exercises:</b> 30 percent.
<li><b>Final Project:</b> 40 percent.
</ul>

I will assign grades (for those who so opt) by following the guidelines
on <a
href="http://www.coa.edu/ADMISSIONS/Registrar/CourseCatalog/AcademicPlanning/records.html">page 8</a>
of the COA Course Catalog.  I do not have any quota of A's, B's, etc.<p><br>


<h3>Journals</h3>
I will expect you to keep a journal throughout the course.  
<ol>
<li> You should write 2 (or more) entries per week.  Each entry should
be at least one page.
<li> You may write informally.  I don't care about grammar or spelling
or syntax (within reason).  I'm mainly interested in witnessing you
thinking and engaging the material.
<li>I will collect journals periodically.
<li>You may keep the "journal" electronically if you wish.
<li> I may occasionally assign or suggest certain topics to write on.
</ol>

<h3>Study Groups</h3>
<ol>
<li>By the end of the first week, you should form study groups of 
4 people each.
<li>These groups should meet at least one time a week for around an
hour.
<li>Groups will be asked to bring ideas and questions to class.
</ol>

<h3>Final Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Can take many forms -- need not be a paper.
<li>  Should be on some topic that's interesting to you.
<li>  Must be more than a "book report."  You should do some analysis
and/or consult primary sources.
<li>  I'll have a list of possible ideas for projects up on the
course web site by the beginning of week 2.
<li>  Can be done collaboratively.
<li> <b> A rough draft is due by the end of week 7.</b>
</ul>



<h3>Other Policies and Stuff</h3>

<ol>
<li>This course does not fulfill the QR requirement.  It does satisfy the
history requirement.  
<li>The final version of the syllabus will be on the course webpage.
<li>All course work must be completed by the end of the term.  I will
    not grant an incomplete except in extreme circumstances.
<li>I expect you to attend class and study group meetings.
<li>We will see at least two films.  These may require evening attendance.
<li>We may need to schedule a few extra classes during the last two
    weeks of the term.
<li>Academic misconduct -- cheating, plagarizing, etc. -- is bad.  Any cases
    of academic misconduct will result in a judicial hearing, as per
    pp. 14-15 of the COA handbook.  Possible consequences range from
    failure of the assignment to expulsion.  For more, see the <a
    href="../academic.misconduct.html">revised statement on academic
    integrity</a> passed by the faculty last winter.
</ol>
