<li>The Alan Sokal article, <a
href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/afterword_v1a/afterword_v1a_singlefile.html">Transgressing
the Boundaries: An Afterword</a>, that I mentioned in class on Tuesday
May 11.<p>



<li>A CNN site on the <a href="http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/">Cold
War</a> recommended by Anthony.  There looks to be a lot of good
information here.<p>  

<li><a
href="http://neutrino.nuc.berkeley.edu/neutronics/todd/nuc.bomb.html">Documentation
and Diagrams of the Atomic Bomb</a>.  Some pretty good technical info here.<p>

<li>The <a href="http://www.dannen.com/szilard.html">Leo Szilard</a> home page.<p>

<li><a href="http://charm.physics.ucsb.edu/people/hnn/physicists.html">Pictures</a> 
of many of the scientists we've been reading about.<p>

<li><a href="http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/science.html">Science,
Technology, and Culture</a> at UC Santa Barbara.  There are about a
billion annotated links here.  Looks pretty useful.<p>

<li><a
href="http://www.ans.neep.wisc.edu/~ans/point_source/QandA/">Nuclear
Questions and Answers</a>.  Good, basic information about radiation
and its effects from the University of Wisconsin.<p>

<li> An amazing collection of <a
href="http://www.cfcsc.dnd.ca/links/milhist/wwii.html">World War II
Links</a>.  Lots and lots of stuff here, including maps, many oral
histories and interviews, and atomic bomb info.<p>

<li>A <a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/1999/ph161/l16.html">lecture on
nuclear power</a> from a <a
href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/1999/phys161.html"> Physics of Energy
and The Environment</a> taught at the University of Oregon.  Some good
images and lots of information and links here.  <p>

<li><a href="http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~shartzog/NukePage.html">Nuke
Links</a>.  Another large, well-organized page of links. <p>

<li>Anthony Yartel reports that Anne Swann has found a good website, 
<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/nagasaki/">Remembering
Nagasaki</a>.  This site is very well done and has some extraordinary
photographs and commentary.  Highly recommended.<p>
