<h3>1700-1800</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>1704</b> Isaac Newton: modeled the atom using billiard balls.

<li><b>1789</b> Martin Heinrich Klaproth extracted a grayish metallic
material from a sample of Joachimsthal pitchblend and named it Uranium.<p>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>1800-1900</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>1873</b> James Clerk Maxwell: introduced the electro magnetic
field around atoms.

<li><b>1885</b> Balmer: the Balmer series was introduced, light was
shot through hydrogen and the light spectrum that came from it was
studied. 

<li><b>1887</b> Heinrich Hertz: discovered electric waves (radio).

<li><b>1890</b> Rydberg: found a more consistent bomber series, led to
Rydberg constant.

rays, showed that glowing matter wasn't light waves.

including alpha and beta particles.
</ul>
<br>

certain particles can only vibrate at certain energies, this led to
Planks constant.

</ul><br>

<h3>1928</h3>
<ul>
<li>
</ul><br>

<h3>1929</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oppenheimer published 16 papers between 1926 and 1929.
<li>Oppenheimer accepts join positions at Caltech and Berkeley. 
</ul><br>

<h3>1930</h3>
<ul>
<li>
</ul><br>

<h3>1931</h3>
<ul>
<li>
</ul><br>

<h3>1932</h3>
<ul>
<li>Irene Curie succeeds her famous, but sadly mortally ill, mother
Marie as director of the Radium Institute in Paris. 
<li>August 2:  Carl Anderson, working with a carefully prepared cloud
chamber at the California Institute of Technology, discovers a
positively charged electron, the "positron."  This was the first
indication that the universe consists not only of matter but of
antimatter as well. 
</ul><br>

<h3>1933</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fermi, Segre, Corbino, Amaldi, et al. open a well funded, richly
staffed physics research center in Rome, complete with a "well-made"
cloud chamber and a nearby radium source (as well as wooden and marble
tables), to begin intensive study of the atomic nucleus. 
<li>October: Solvay Conference in Brussels, Belgium.  For the first
time, this prestigious congregation was devoted purely to the
consideration of nuclear physics.  Attendance at this affair was the
excuse the Soviet physicist George Gamow used to affect his
defection. 
</ul><br>

<h3>1934</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fermi and his "Boys" test artificial transmutation in a vast array
of elements.  Observing the behavior of bombarded Uranium, they note
that one of its decay products is an unknown substance with a 13
minute half life.  In the their following publication they suggest the
"possibility that the atomic number of the element may be greater than
92." 
<li>January 15: Irene Curie and her husband Frederic Joliot publish a
report in the Comptes Rendus describing that in the course of
experimentation with alpha particles to find the elusive neutron, they
discover how to make matter radioactive by artificial means.  "These
experiments," they write, "give the first chemical proof of artificial
transmutation" (they win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the work the
following year). 
<li>March 12:  Leo Szilard, in London, files the first of several
patent applications relating to nuclear energy.  By the end of the
1935, the lot of them would be merged into one complete specification:
"Improvements in or Relating to the Transmutation of Chemical
Elements."  Without a bit of laboratory experimentation, Szilard was
already acting on his idea of nuclear chain reaction, with
applications from power production to, with a correct "critical mass"
of chain-reacting substance, "explosion." 
<li>July 4: Marie Sklodowska Curie dies.
<li>September: Ida Noddack publishes "On element 93," in it proposing
"when heavy nuclei are bombarded by neutrons, it is conceivable that
the nucleus breaks into several large fragments, which would of course
be isotopes of known elements but would not be neighbors."  This
highly insightful piece of work would largely go ignored. 
</ul><br>

<h3>1935</h3>
<ul>
<li>Noticing a disparity in results of the same experiment on tables
of wood and tables of marble, Amaldi and the Boys find that slowing
neutrons gives nuclei more time to effect their "capture;"  Segre
would subsequently the highly effective neutron-slowing powers of
paraffin. 
<li>Szilard begins searching for funds for his chain reaction
research. 
<li>Szilard requests for the British War Office to hold and keep
secret his patents for nuclear chain reactions.  Not until February
1936, and with the prodding of Frederick Lindemann, does the Admiralty
accept the patent for safe-keeping. 
</ul><br>


<h3>1936</h3>
<ul>
<li>Civil war begins in Spain.
<li>January 27:  Bohr, arguing for radical theoretical change,
introduces a model for a multi-particle atomic nucleus closely packed
and bound by the short range strong force.  The following year, he
publishes another proposal explaining the usefulness of mathematically
modeling the nucleus as one would a drop of liquid. 

</ul><br>

<h3>1937</h3>
<ul>
<li>October 20:  Ernest Rutherford dies.

-- Italian race." 
<li>Summer: Maurice Goldhaber emigrates to U.S.
<li>August:  Bohr speaks at International Congress of Anthropologic
and Ethnographic Sciences in Helsingor, Zealand.
<li>September 1:  Anti-Semitic laws passed in Italy
</ul><br>

<li>Late January:  Szilard asks Fermi to keep the possibility of
producting a chain reaction secret.

Berlin and threatens to bomb Prague unless the Czechs surrender to
Germany

U.S. Navy to tell him about the possibility of the liberation of
atomic energy leading to powerful explosives that could have military
use.

found neutron activity about 10% higher with Uranium oxide than
without it. 
<li>Fermi and Anderson leave to pursue other things
<li> Szilard comes up with the idea to use graphite as a moderator,
rather than water.
<li>Through correspondence with Fermi, the idea of using graphite
becomes steadily more plausible.

from Einstein, wrote up a letter to the government about the
possibilities of fission (and also about the dangers of it).
