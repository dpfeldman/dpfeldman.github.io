<b>Required:</b>

<b>Recommended:</b>

<ul>
<li>Photocopied articles from <i>Action and Knowledge:  Breaking the
Monopoly with Participatory Action-Research</i>.  These will appear in
your mailboxes.  These two short pieces discuss the philosophical and
epistemological underpinnings of community-based research.  This isn't
the lightest of reading; it's kinda jargon-filled.  <p>

<li>If you want to know more, browse the <a href="http://www.loka.org">Loka
Institute's Web Site</a>.  There's lots of info here.<p>
