I will begin my presentation by giving a definition of community-based
research (CBR).  Briefly, CBR is research conducted by, for or with the
participation of community members.  CBR presents an alternative to
the "top-down", "expert" driven research predominant in the U.S.  I
will then briefly give several examples of CBR, including work done in
North Carolina on hog farming, and the over 35 "science shops"
currently operating in the Netherlands.  <p>
 
I will then discuss guidelines for CBR recently proposed and
implemented by communities and scientists across the
country. Throughout the talk I will also discuss our role at the Loka
Institute in helping establish CBR projects here and abroad as part of
our community research network project.  The Community research
network is a transnational project linking hundreds of universities
and grassroots organizations doing community based research.  <p>

This talk will be quite informal.  There will be plenty of time for
questions and discussion both during and after my presentation.  <p>
