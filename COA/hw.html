Due at the beginning of next class.  You are strongly encouraged to
discuss these problems with other people in the class and the
instructor.  The work you turn in should represent your own
understanding, however.<p>

<ol>

<li> In your own words, explain the concept of dimension that we
discussed in class.  If you can, give an informal, yet operative
definition of dimension.  That is, state how one measures a
dimension.  Feel free to use pictures and diagrams if you wish.<p>

This is not intended to be a short essay that I'll grade for
correctness.  Rather, this should consist of notes in the style of a
journal entry.  Also, feel free to mention any points you might be
confused about, and any aspects of dimension that are particularly
interesting, surprising, or puzzling to you.<p>

<li> It costs $130 to lay down lime green carpet in a room.  How
much will it cost to carpet a room that is 5 times as large? <p>

<li> How many cubic centimeters are in a cubic meter? <p>

<li> A small beaker can hold .75 liters of water.  How much water can
be held by a beaker that is 3 times as large? <p>


<li> What is the dimension of the <a href="T.gif">this shape?</a><p>


<li> (Do this one if we haven't discussed it in class yet.)
Metabolism rate is a measure of the amount of energy an 
individual typically expends (while at rest) in 1 second.  How would
you expect the metabolism rate of mammals to scale with animal size?
That is, if you double the linear dimensions of a mammal, what happens
to its metabolic rate?  <b> Clearly state the reason(s) for your
answer(s). Getting the ``correct'' answer isn't important.  The
reasoning behind your answers is what I'm after.</b>
