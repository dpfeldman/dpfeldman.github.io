2.  The floor to be carpeted is an area and hence has a dimension of 2.
    Increasing the linear dimensions of the room by a factor of 5 will
    increase the area by a factor of 5^2 = 25.  Thus, the total cost
    of the carpet for the bigger room will be 25 x $130 =
    $3250. <p>

3.  There are 100 centimeters in a meter.  A cubic meter is a
    measure of volume, so the dimension is 3.  As a result, there
    are 100^3 = 1,000,000 cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. <p>

4.  The beaker is holding a volume of water, so the dimension here is
    3.  Scaling up the beaker by a factor of 3 will scale up the
    volume by a factor of 3^3 = 27.  Thus, the big beaker can hold
    27 x .75  liters = 20.25 liters.<p>

5.  Don't feel bad if you had trouble with this problem.  I think that
    this example is a good bit harder than the snowflake example we
    did in class.<p>

    Notice that the big triangle appears to be made up of 3 smaller,
    identical triangles.  Thus, three small copies of the triangle fit
    inside one big triangle.  But what's the scale factor?  Notice
    that 2 bases of the little triangles fit on the base of the
    large triangle.  So the scale factor here is 2; all sides grow
    by a factor of 2.  So,<p>
<center>  number of copies that fit  inside scaled up version = 
(scale factor)^D<p>
 3  = 2^D.<p>

Solving for D, we find:<p>
<center>
  D = (log 3)/(log 2) = 1.59.

   Still confused about the dimension of the Sierpinski triangle?  Check out this excellent web page on <a href="http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html#SECTION00060000000000000000">Fractal Dimension</a> by Bob Devaney.<p>
