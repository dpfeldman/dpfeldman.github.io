A line of riot cops.  A line of police formed to the right (from the
point of view of the previous pictures which were looking at the wall
from the outside.)  Shortly after this picture was taken, police
launched canisters into the middle of the crowd instead of just using
tear gas right by the wall.  The crowd fled backwards (tear gas isn't
fun) and the police moved forward.  <p>
