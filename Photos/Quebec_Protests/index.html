<p><br><br>


Representative from the government of all nations in North and South
America, with the exception of Cuba, met in Quebec City, April 19-22,
2001.  The purpose of this summit was to work on developing a
NAFTA-like free trade agreement that would span all of the Americas.
Around 100,000 activists showed up to protest against the FTAA.
