The march viewed from above.  The march veered away from the center
part of the city where the meeting (and the protests and clashes and 
tear gas were).  Many people in the march, including us, went toward
the walled off area instead of following the main march route.  The
walled off area is up on a bluff; this picture is looking back on
the march down below.
