<p class="w3-large"><b>David P. Feldman, <i>Chaos and Dynamical
  Systems.</i> Princeton University Press, 2019. ISBN: 9780691161525.</b></p>  

      <p class="w3-large">Chaos and Dynamical Systems presents an
      accessible, clear introduction to dynamical systems and chaos
      theory, important and exciting areas that have shaped many
      scientific fields. While the rules governing dynamical systems
      are well-specified and simple, the behavior of many dynamical
      systems is remarkably complex. Of particular note, simple
      deterministic dynamical systems produce output that appears
      random and for which long-term prediction is impossible. Using
      little math beyond basic algebra, David Feldman gives readers a
      grounded, concrete, and concise overview.</p> 

      <p class="w3-large">In initial chapters, Feldman introduces
      iterated functions and differential equations. He then surveys
      the key concepts and results to emerge from dynamical systems:
      chaos and the butterfly effect, deterministic randomness,
      bifurcations, universality, phase space, and strange
      attractors. Throughout, Feldman examines possible scientific
      implications of these phenomena for the study of complex
      systems, highlighting the relationships between simplicity and
	complexity, order and disorder.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-large">Filling the gap between popular accounts of
      dynamical systems and chaos and textbooks aimed at physicists
      and mathematicians, Chaos and Dynamical Systems will be highly
      useful not only to students at the undergraduate and advanced
      levels, but also to researchers in the natural, social, and
      biological sciences.</p>

    <p class="w3-large">"

There is a significant and (I hope) growing genre in the physics
      literature, that of the informative introductory book. Such a
      book lands in the valley between two extremes of scientific
      exposition. On the one hand, a popular book can often introduce
      a nonexpert reader to a subject, with a focus on the big ideas
      and the history of a field and the personalities that shaped
      it. Such a book can, however, be frustrating owing to its lack
      of detail and specific results about its field. On the other
      hand, a standard textbook can be exhaustive in detail, but omit
      the background thinking that gives the subject life and
      meaning. Feldman's Chaos and Dynamical Systems deliberately and
      deftly navigates the gap between these extremes."<br><br>

      "The greatest strength of this book is the logic and clarity of
      the discussion. Each topic, each idea, is developed and
      explained. ... A secondary strength is that Feldman places the
      specific results in a broader context." 
      

<!--      "In the preface of his magisterial work The
    Variational Principles of Mechanics, Cornelius Lanczos bemoans the
    authors of typical mathematical physics texts who write “as though
    to impress the reader with the uncomfortable feeling that he is in
    the permanent presence of a superman.” In contrast, Professor
    Feldman comes down to our level and lends a human voice to his
    prose, sharing the excitement and fun of seeing unexpected
    complexity and beauty arise from seemingly simple beginnings."-->

    L. Bohn, <b><a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/88/4/335/1042982/Chaos-and-Dynamical-Systems">American

      "David Feldman has written a gentle and loving introduction to
      dynamical systems.... If you have not ever read anything about
      dynamical systems and if a simple differential equation is your
      friend (or future friend) then this book is for you. The
      mathematics is clear and well-explained. The examples are as
      simple as possible while still illustrating the points....
 
If, however, you are an expert on dynamical systems then this book
      will not teach you anything new. Still, I would encourage
      experts to read this book because Feldman’s writing style is so
      gentle and clear that even experts will learn about expository
      writing.  <br><br>

      [T]his is an excellent introduction to chaotic systems with
      well-written prose, clear examples, and a comprehensive list of
      references for further reading. Chaos and Dynamical Systems is a
      book for everyone from the layman to the expert. Each will find
      it useful, informative, and a model of what a popular
      mathematics book should be."

    <p class="w3-large">"His approach is more on an intuitive basis, letting the reader
    be surprised by the results produced, and then asking (and
    answering) the questions that the reader naturally would ask: Why
    is it like that? How is this possible? ...  With a minimum of
    mathematics, Feldman succeeds in introducing the reader to the
    world of dynamical systems and the, almost mythical, chaos that
    they can produce."  &mdash; Adhemar
