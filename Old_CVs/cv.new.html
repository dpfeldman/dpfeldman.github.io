<h3>RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h3>

<b> Exact, Analytic Calculation of Excess Entropy, Statistical
Complexity and the epsilon-Machine for Finite-Range, One-Dimensional
Spin Systems.</b>  (<i>With J. Crutchfield</i>.)  These quantities
    use information theory and the theory of formal computation to
    measure the memory and intrinsic computational ability of statistical
    mechanical systems.  Carried out extensive comparison of
    information theoretic, computational mechanical and statistical
    mechanical approaches to the discovery and quantification of
    patterns in statistical systems.  <p> 
<b> Analysis of a Recently-Proposed Statistical Complexity Measure.</b>
    (<i>With J. Crutchfield</i>.) Proved that
    the complexity measure suggested by Lopez-Ruiz, Mancini,
    and Calbet vanishes exponentially fast in
    system size for all finite-step ergodic Markov chains. Concluded
    that the proposed measure is unsuitable for use in a statistical
    mechanical context. 

<h3>CURRENT RESEARCH</h3>

<b>Extension of results to more than one dimension.</b> (<i>With J.
    Crutchfield</i>.)  Developing C++ programs to complement analytic
    techniques.  Will use exact results for 1D systems to develop a
    theory of "finite size scaling" for epsilon-machines.  Will then
    carry out calculations for cellular automata and the 2D Ising
    model. <p> 

<b>Multifractal Spectrum</b>. (<i>With K. Young and J. Crutchfield</i>.) 
    Will compare the description of a system's fluctuations
provided by the multifractal spectra to information and computation
theoretic measures of structure.  Will compare and contrast
thermodynamic phase transitions with the "phase transitions" that
arise in the thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems.
