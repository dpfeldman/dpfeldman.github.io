<h3> TEACHING EXPERIENCE </h3>

<b> Chancellor's Teaching Fellow</b>. Physics 9A, Introductory, 
    Calculus-based Mechanics for Physical Science and Engineering 
    majors.  UC Davis, Spring, 1996.    Will share 
    equally in all aspects of course preparation and delivery with 
    Prof. Richard Scalettar.  Plan to develop interactive lectures 
    and emphasize collaborative learning<p>

<b> Office of Naval Research High School Apprenticeship Program</b>.  UC Davis,
    7/95 - 8/95.  Worked with two high school girls from local schools.
    Taught basics of the UNIX environment, the internet, and
    some simple programming in the context of chaotic dynamical systems.<p>  

<b> Teaching Assistant</b>, Physics 104AB, Mathematical Methods.
    UC Davis, 9/94 - 3/96.  Held regular office hours, graded assignments,
    prepared solutions, assisted in writing exams, 
    gave occasional lectures. <p>

<b> Discussion Leader</b>, Physics 9ABCD, Calculus-Based Physics for
    Physical Science and Engineering majors.  UC Davis, 9/93 - 6/95. Led 7 
    weekly problem-solving sessions that emphasized collaborative 
    learning.   <p>

<b> High School Science and Math Teacher</b>.  The McCallie School.
    Chattanooga, TN.  8/91 - 6/93. <p>
<ul>
<li>  Courses Taught:
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Quantitative Physical Science</b> (Honors and Regular).  
        Responsible for all aspects of course.  Developed units on
    	statistics, chaos, quantum mechanics, and the physics of baseball.
    	Designed lab exercises on finding absolute zero, determining the
    	speed of a thrown baseball, and standard deviation.
        <li>   <b>Tenth Grade Geometry</b>.   Responsible for all
        aspects of course.  Introduced unit on fractal geometry.
    </ul>
<li>  <b>Co-Dean of the Freshman Class</b>.  Chief academic advisor to 35 
    freshmen.  Attended bi-weekly meetings to discuss school academic policy.
<li>  <b> New Faculty Training and Mentor Program</b>. 
    Paired with a senior teacher who visited classes monthly.  Attended
    monthly workshops on pedagogy.
<li>  <b> Other</b>.  Assistant Varsity Lacrosse Coach.  Assistant Junior
    School Cross Country Coach.   Dormitory Advisor.
