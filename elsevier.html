<h3>Why I Refuse to Referee for Elsevier Journals<br>

For the last several years I have been refusing to referee articles
for journals published by Elsevier.  Below is a version of the letter
that I send to editors explaining my reasons for not refereeing for
Elsevier.  I encourage other scientists to do the same. <p><br>

<hr><p><br>

Dear Editor,<p>

Thank you for your email asking me to referee an article for your
journal.  I recognize refereeing papers is part of my responsibility
as a member of the research community, and I try to referee as many
papers as I reasonably can each year.  However, I will not be able to
serve as a referee for the paper you sent me.<p>

I feel it is not appropriate to provide uncompensated labor, in the
form of refereeing, to a for-profit enterprise such as Elsevier.  In
2008 Reed-Elsevier reported an operating profit of over 1.1 Billion
euros. (See the Reed-Elsevier annual reports
available <a href="http://www.reed-elsevier.com/investorcentre/reports%202007/Pages/2008.aspx">here</a>.)
Forty-one percent of this profit, 716 million euros, comes from
Elsevier, the division of Reed-Elsevier devoted to publishing journals
in science, engineering, and medicine.  Much of this profit comes at
the expense of the scientific community.  Authors and referees are
uncompensated.  And for-profit journals such as those owned by
Elsevier, charge subscriptions rates that are, on average,
between <a href="http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Journals/jeprevised.pdf">3
    and 6 times as expensive</a> as those produced by non-profit
professional societies.  These exorbitant costs must be born by
college and university libraries &mdash;organizations which are, for
the most part, publicly funded.  Elsevier reaps large profits from
uncompensated labor of the scientific community and directly from
public expenditures for university libraries. <p>
 
Moreover, I have read recently about the Merck
corporation <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&o_url=blog/display/55671&id=55671">paying
    Elsevier</a> to publish a journal which appeared to be a
peer-reviewed journal of medicine, but was not.  This "journal"
consisted only reprinted articles favorable to Merck's products and contained no
indication that it was sponsored by Merck and was not a peer-reviewed
medical journal.  It did, however, contain the Elsevier imprint.
Subsequently, it was revealed
that <a href"http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/06/tally_of_elseviers_fake_medica.php">Elsevier
    has published as many as nine such fake medical journals</a>.  This seems to me to be a grave violation of research
ethics and public trust. <p> 

I have thus decided to no longer perform referring services for Elsevier.
I can no longer in good conscience support for-profit
academic journal publishers such as Elsevier, as I believe Elsevier is
ultimately harmful to the scientific enterprise.<p><br>
