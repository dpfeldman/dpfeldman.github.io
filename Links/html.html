<li><h3><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/">Web Design Group</a></h3> 
       "The Web Design Group was founded to promote the creation of
       non-browser specific, non-resolution specific, creative and 
       informative sites that are accessible to all users
       worldwide. To this end, the WDG offers material on a wide range
       of HTML 
       related topics. We hope that with this site as a reference, you
       will be able to create Web sites that can be used by every
       person on 
       the Internet, regardless of browser, platform, or settings."

"The W3C was founded in October 1994 to lead the World Wide Web to its
full potential by developing common protocols that promote its
evolution 
and ensure its interoperability. We are an international industry
consortium, jointly hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology 
Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in the United States; the
Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique
[INRIA] 
in Europe; and the Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus in
Japan. Services provided by the Consortium include: a repository of
information 
about the World Wide Web for developers and users; reference code
implementations to embody and promote standards; and various prototype
and 
sample applications to demonstrate use of new technology. " <p><br>
