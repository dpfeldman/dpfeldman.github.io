<h3>Sorry that the link didn't work. I recently moved my website to a
  new URL. This has resulted in many broken links. If you replace
  "hornacek.coa.edu/dave" with "dpfeldman.github.io", you'll likely
  find what you're looking for.
  <br/><br/>
  I.e., "hornacek.coa.edu/dave/foo/bar" should be
"dpfeldman.github.io/foo/bar".
<br/><br/>
I'd be grateful if you could let me know what page you were on that
  had the broken link. You can send email to dfeldman@coa.edu. Thanks.</h3>
