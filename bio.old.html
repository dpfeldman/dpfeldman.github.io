David Feldman received a B.A. in Physics from Carleton
College in 1991 and a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of
California at Davis in 1998.  From 1991-1993, he was a teacher of 9th
and 10th grade physics and mathematics at The McCallie School in
Chattanooga, TN.  As a graduate student at UC-Davis, Dave received
several awards in recognition of both teaching and scholarship:  The
Dissertation Year Fellowship; The Chancellor's Teaching Fellowship;
and he was nominated for the Outstanding Graduate Student Teaching
Award.  Dave joined the faculty at COA in 1998, where he teaches a
wide range of physics and math courses.  He also teaches classes that
explore connections between science and politics, such as Making the
Bomb (about the Manhattan project and atomic weapons), and Gender and
Science.  Students that have worked with Dave at COA have done a wide
range of projects, including: designing a series of web pages about 
Three Mile
Island; developing a computer model of a lobster fishery; writing a
high school physics curriculum; and doing applied mathematics
research. <p>

Dave's research training is in theoretical physics and mathematics,
and his research interests lie in the fields of statistical mechanics
and nonlinear dynamics.  In particular, his research has examined how
one might measure "complexity" or pattern in a mathematical system,
and how such complexity is related to disorder.  This work
can be loosely categorized as belonging to the constellation of
research topics often referred to as "chaos and complex systems."
In his research, Dave uses both analytic and computational
techniques.  Dave has authored research papers in journals including
Physical Review E, Chaos, Physics Letters A, and Advances in Complex
Systems.  Dave is a frequent visiting researcher at The Santa Fe
Institute and is an Associate Graduate Faculty member in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Maine. <p>
 
His other interests include ultimate frisbee, hockey, politics,
cooking, and gardening. <p>
