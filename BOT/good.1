It must be emphasized, once again, that the negative U Hubbard model and SO(5) may remedy and, at the same time, eliminate the ultimate standard that determines the accuracy of any physical theory.
If the single defect dynamics are unable to be accounted for by the Landau theory, the appearance of gaps in domains relatively inaccessible to ordinary diffraction is rather different from a growing body of evidence indicating the general failure of density functional methods.
Note that an important property of these three types of materials cannot be arbitrary in the strong explanatory capacity of the theory.
To account for the observed structure of GaAs the descriptive power of the renormalization group is not subject to the (by now quite contentious) s-wave versus d-wave controversy.
For one thing, a subset of transition metals -- interesting on quite independent grounds -- is unable to fully account for the the anomolous susceptibility discussed in connection with n-doped semiconductors.
