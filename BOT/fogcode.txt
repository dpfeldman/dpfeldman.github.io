# This program will create sentences from a selection of phrases.
# The idea is based on a program by John Lawler, and this code was designed
# in collaboration with him. This whole thing was Lawler's idea :-)
#
# (actually, I got the Chomsky phrases from Anthony Aristar, who
#  got them from somebody else, and doesn't remember who, and
#  I just ported them to my previous program FOGGY, which
#  already had phrase collections from Software Engineering and
#  Folklore Research.  But it *was* my idea to do it on the Web.
