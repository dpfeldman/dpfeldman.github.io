To characterize electronic transport properties
On the other hand,
This suggests that
It appears that
Furthermore,
Evidence provided by spectroscopy suggests the following:
To account for the observed structure of GaAs
For any transformation which is sufficiently diversified in application to be of any interest,
Analogously,
Clearly,
Note that
Of course,
Suppose, for instance, that
Thus
With this clarification,
Conversely,
We have already seen that
By combining quantum monte carlo and molecular dynamics techniques
I suggested that these results would follow from the assumption that
If the single defect dynamics are unable to be accounted for by the Landau theory,
However, this assumption is not correct, since
Comparing these examples with their superconducting analogues, we see that
In the discussion of Luttinger liquid theory in the late '80's,,
So far,
Nevertheless,
For one thing,
Summarizing, then, we assume that
A consequence of the approach just outlined is that
Presumably,
On our assumptions,
It may be, then, that
It must be emphasized, once again, that
Let us continue to suppose that
Notice, incidentally, that
Perhaps,
