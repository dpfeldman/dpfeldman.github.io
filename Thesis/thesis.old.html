<h3> <a href="thesis.stats.html">Vital Statistics</a> for Several 
Recent Dissertations </h3><p>
<h3><b>Updates:</b></h3>

<ul>
<li> 8 July 1998:  322 Pages.  I write.  The readers read.<p>
<li>
5 June 1998:  313 Pages.  Document has been changed from 1.5 to double spacing
and now, I think, conforms to all grad studies regulations.  Another chapter has
been written and the introduction is now done.  The thesis is complete except
for one chapter and the conclusion.  I continue to make steady progess. <p>
<li> 
29 April 1998:  191 Pages. 16 Chapters. 7 Appendices.  I continue to edit
and write introductory sections to tie chapters together.  There are no 
more errors in cross references and citations!  3 chapters are as yet
largely unwritten, and it's possible that they stay thay way.  Another
chapter is only about half done.  Steady progress is being made on all
fronts.<p>
<li> 21 April 1998:  188 Pages.  16
Chapters. 5 Appendices. Have incorporated two papers and several 
sets of previously LaTeX'ed notes.  Lots and lots and lots of relatively minor
editing to do.  Around 4 chapters (not counting intro and conclusion)
still need major editing and writing.<p> 
</ul>
