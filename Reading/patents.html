The emergence of the biotechnology
revolution is a defining aspect of the end of the 20th century. The
breakthroughs in molecular genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology
offer extraordinary new possibilities for preventing and treating
disease, for a deeper understanding of the interactions of organisms
with each other and their environment, and for entirely new
manufacturing technologies. Intertwined with the development of
biotechnology has been its rapid commercialization.<p>

An unforeseen and deeply troubling
aspect of this commercialization is the transformation of biological
entities that are the products of hundreds of millions of years of
evolution into private property. This is taking place through the
radical extension of patent law to encompass gene sequences,  cell
lines, genetically modified organisms and even natural species. These 
profound changes in policy  are being implemented through the
administrative procedures of the US Patent and Trademark  Office 
(PTO), outside of public debate or Congressional
oversight.<p>

The rapidity and range of this
privatization is only just entering public consciousness. Myriad
Pharmaceutical owns patents on the human genes damaged in breast
cancer; Human Genome Sciences has patented the  entire genomes of
important bacterial pathogens affecting public health; Monsanto owns
patents on genetically engineered soybeans and cotton varieties;
Sequana Therapeutics has filed for patents on the cells and genes of
indigenous tribes in New Guinea. Rice-tec corporation has obtained
patents on the Basmati rice variety grown in India for thousands of
years. <p>

Such life patents represent a sharp
departure from the historical traditions of human societies. Farmers
have always owned the crops they grew, but they had no legal rights to
restrict others from growing those crops. The Monsanto patent on
transgenic cotton extends to all the progeny of such plants and allows
Monsanto to prevent farmers from saving the seed of crops they have
grown and planting them the next season. The cloning of Dolly was not
announced until the Roslin Institute had filed patents not just for
cloned sheep, but for all animals produced anywhere in the world by a
similar process. Such private expropriation of fundamental biological
resources reflects a qualitative change in access to  basic biological
knowledge and to the relations between human society and the natural
world.<p>

The consequences of this social
transformation  has been the subject of a series of recent books
including  Vandana Shiva's <i>Biopiracy</i>,  (Boston, South
End Press, 1997), Sheldon Krimsky and Roger Wrubel's
<i>Agricultural Biotechnology and the Environment,</i> (University of
Illinois), 1997;  Jeremy Rifkin's <i>The Biotech
Century</i>.(Tarcher/Putnam, 1998) and  Martin Teitel's and Hope
Shand's 's "The Ownership of Life"	<p>

A patent allows the owner to
exclude others from using or benefiting from the patented invention,
process or construct of matter. US patent law, by granting a monopoly
for twenty years,  allows the patent holders to prevent others  from
producing or utilizing the 'invention', even if for medical purposes or
human welfare. This takes the form of infringement suits, injunctions
against sales of products, and other forms of litigation, threatened or
actual. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of such suits are brought
regularly as corporations and even universities manoeuvre for control
of lucrative monopolies which follow from patent
ownership.<p>

US patent laws were originally
written by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was an active plant breeder and
corresponded with leading breeders in Europe. Nonetheless, the patent
laws as developed by him excluded animals and plants from their
coverage. Jefferson was clear that patents were a form of monopoly. He
believed the role of patents  lay not in the generalized protection of
private property, but in the limited and specific purpose of ensuring
that creative and inventive individuals were able to make a living, and
thus continue to contribute to society. He wrote that whenever this
monopoly was contrary to the public interest, the public interest would
take precedence.<p>

With the commercialization of plant breeding and seed production in
the 1920's, breeders attempted to 
restrict competition through inclusion of ornamental plant and other
hybrids under the patent laws. Resistance from consumer groups and
farmers prevented this, but breeders were granted some "protection" by
the Congress through the  passage of separate legislation, the Plant
Variety Protection Acts of 1930 and 1970. Organisms in general and
their genes, proteins, or component cell lines, remained  excluded from
general patent monopolies. <p>

This two hundred-year-old legacy
was breached in 1980 with the granting of a patent for a genetically
engineered bacterium by the US Supreme Court in Chakrabarty
<i>vs</i>. US Patent and Trademark Office. The decision was
very close (five to four) and was narrowly constructed with respect to
genetically modified microorganisms.  In the years following, under
pressure from the pharmaceutical, biotech and agrotech interests, the
PTO began issuing patents on genes, human cell lines and plant strains.
US corporate interests have used the vehicle of GATT and the World
Trade  Organization to aggressively press for enforcement of life
patents by other nations. <p>

The criteria for the granting of
patents under existing US patent law are novelty, utility and
nonobviousness.  Prior to the Chakrabarty decision patents were limited
to true inventions of machines, novel processes, synthetic materials
and related "compositions of matter'. Such 'products of nature' have
historically been excluded from patent protection. Thus elements and
minerals cannot be patented because they are found or discovered, and
not invented. As biologists we are appalled at the claims that the
determination of the nucleotide sequence of a gene represents a novel
invention. <p>

However, the fundamental  issues
are questions of social policy and not legal interpretation. The
Constitution simply states that the Congress shall have the power to
grant patents "to promote the useful arts".  Patent laws are passed,
modified and abrogated by the Congress just as other laws governing the
country. They are means to social progress, not an end in themselves.
<p>

The intellectual property rights on
human creative or scholar activity patents should not be confused with
the "intellectual property rights" lawyers use in referring to life
patents.  Books, drawings, songs and other products of the human
intellect are categories totally different from  human genes or basmati
rice plants which have evolved over hundreds of millions of years.
<p>

Life patents undermine our ability to reap the fruits of these
scientific and technological  advances through multiple paths. <p> 
<br>

<h4>Intereference with research and scholarship</h4>

The biotechnology revolution was
the product of a broadbased biomedical research and training campaign
launched by the Congress after WWII, and based in colleges,
universities and medical schools throughout the nation. Essential to
this public endeavor was the free communication and exchange of
materials and ideas. Major  scientific advances, such as the
determination of the amino acid sequences that made up protein chains,
were openly communicated and entered the public domain. The enormous
inventiveness of this period occurred without patents.<p>

Patent law requires that the
subject of the patent has not been revealed as "prior art".  Oral
reports, abstracts, grant proposals and published papers all constitute
prior art. Thus individuals or groups planning to file for a patent
have to avoid public disclosure of the work prior to the filing of the
patent claim. Patent attorneys regularly advise researchers to restrict
presentations to  colleagues, so as not to jeopardize planned patent
submissions.  The resulting undermining and reversal of the biomedical
culture of open communication and exchange is one  of the most
destructive impacts of life patents.<p><br>


<h4>Negative Consequences for Health Care and Medicine</h4>

In the health care field patents
not only retard progress at the level of research, but interfere with
the delivery of health care. The key commercial value of a patent is
the ability to prevent competitors from  developing or delivering a
related (or superior) process or product and this holds for public and
non profit institutions as well as other companies.<p>

Thus when the Biocyte corporation
obtained a patent on the use of blood cells from the umbilical cord in
a variety of therapeutic situations, health care professionals
responded " We..join.in protesting..the granting of this patent to
Biocyte corporation. We are also concerned that this patent may
discourage and threaten activities of non-profit cord blood banks,
clinicians, patients, parents and the volunteers who support them.
(Nature, 383, 17, 1996).<p>

Corporate spokespeople  claim that,
without patent protection, important therapies and technologies will
not be developed. In fact, what patent protection ensures is not
technological development, but suppression of competition. Patents are
as often used to prevent the development of new technologies as to
exploit them. Some of these barriers have recently been explored by
Heller and  Eisenberg
(<i>Science</i>,Vol. 280, 1 May 1998, pp.
698-70). It is noteworthy than India, Brazil and other countries
patent laws excluded pharmaceutical and other health care products
from patenting, on the basis of protecting public welfare. <p><br>


<h4>Food and Agriculture</fontfamily></h4>

Intellectual
property rights on seeds deprive farmers of free access to an essential
public good -- crop seed.  Farmers for millennia saved the seed of
their harvests for replanting the following year, and continue to do
so even in the 
industrialized agricultural systems of the United States.  Patents on
seeds are a legal means to make sure farmers buy seed every year;
Monsanto took legal action against some 100 farmers  last year for
planting saved seed from their genetically engineered
varieties.<p>

The problems of intellectual
property protection on seed become magnified by the economic 
consolidation currently taking place in the seed industry.  Monsanto
and DuPont alone may now control half of the U.S. soy and corn seed
markets.  At the international level, the ownership situation is
similar:  in Argentina Monsanto owns 40% of the corn seed market; in
Brazil, 30%.  Monopoly control in an oligopolistic market is a sure
recipe for higher seed costs.<p><br>


<h4>Bringing the issues into the democratic process</bold></h4>

The European Parliament, responding
to the initiatives of the Greens, refused to accept patents on genes.
The first vote on such legislation a few years ago ended in a decision
against patents on life. Only the full mobilization of commercial 
interests in 1997 led to the set back of this effort. Just recently the
Dutch Government formally appealed  the decision to the European Court
of Justice.<p>

In Europe, South-east Asia and
South America, there are significant social movements opposing life
patents.  Dramatic public demonstrations occurred in India in response
to W. R. Grace's obtaining patents on the Neem tree, and these were
followed by a vigorous battle in the India's upper parliament to resist
the GATT intellectual property requirements. <p>

The US government and the United
Nations have  recognized the necessity of protecting essential  common
resources from national sovereignty or private ownership. These 
include the oceans, the atmosphere, and the moon, The earth's life
forms need to be in the same category. The first step is the open
discussion of these questions outside patent courts,  in colleges and
universities, in professional societies, and in the US
Congress.<p><br>


<h3>The Blue Mountain Declaration</h3>
Issued at Blue Mountain,  New York June 1995, by a coalition of 25
organizations copncerned with environmental protection, indigenous
peoples and human right)<p>

<blockquote>

The plants, animals, and
microorganisms comprising life on earth are part of the natural world
into which we were all born. The conversion of these species, their
molecules or parts into corporate property through patent monopolies is
counter to the interests of the peoples of this country and of the 
world.<p>

No individual, institution, or
corporation should be able to claim ownership over species or varieties
of living organisms. Nor should they be able to hold patents on organs,
cells, genes or proteins, whether naturally occurring, genetically
altered or otherwise modified.<p>

As part of a world movement to
protect our common living heritage, we call upon the Congress of the
United States to enact legislation to exclude living organisms and
their components from the patent system.<p>
