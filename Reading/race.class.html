Human society is currently passing from the end of the industrial revolution to the first stages 
of the technological revolution. One clear expression of this transformation is the leap in 
electronics and computer technology which is revolutionising both production and 
communication.1 A second expression is the emergence of biotechnology as a major factor in 
pharmaceutical and agricultural production.2 Biotechnology represents a) a new manufacturing 
technology for commodities previously available only by isolation from plants, animals or 
microbes, and b) the means to modify the genomes of living organisms so that the changes are 
propagated in subsequent generations. This vast acceleration of organic evolution has the 
potential to generate qualitative changes in the Earth's organisms and their interactions with 
each other and the ecosystem. The same technology applied to the human species can be used 
to modify the genome of humans, the aspect that frequently dominates news stories and 
popular imagination.
<p>

	A less visible, but equally profound and disturbing, feature of the biotechnology 
revolution is its coupling to the corporate expropriation of agriculturally important  plant and 
animal species: the extension of private ownership from individuals of the species, to all 
organisms of that type. Thus, Monsanto has US patents on all genetically modified cotton 
plants and all their progeny and, in Europe, patents for all genetically modified cotton and 
soybean plants.3 The patents held by Myriad Pharmaceutical in California on genes damaged in 
breast cancer cover those genes derived from any and every human being. The patents filed by 
the Roslin Institute, which financed the cloning of Dolly the sheep, extend to all mammals 
produced anywhere by a similar cloning process. A United States firm, Rice-Tec, Inc., has 
recently been granted a patent (US patent #5,663,484) on basmati rice that is grown anywhere 
in the western hemisphere.
<p>

	This privatisation of organisms and their progeny  poses a new class of dangers to the 
world food supply. Similar factors underlie the rising costs of the new drugs and therapies that 
derive from the integration of biotechnology into the pharmaceutical industry.4 A number of 
important recent books explore the background of these changes including Vandana Shiva's 
Biopiracy, Sheldon Krimsky's Biotechnics and Society, Krimsky and Wrubel's Agricultural 
Biotechnology and the Environment, Ruth Hubbard's Exploding the Gene Myth and Jeremy 
Rifkin's The Biotech Century.5

<h3>
The self-reproduction of organisms
</h3>

	The enormous productivity of conventional agricultural production is often taken for 
granted. One kernel of corn, planted in the early spring, yields a stalk ten feet high with tens of 
ears and tens of thousands of kernels by the summer. This reflects the self-reproducing 
capacity of living cells and organisms, an aspect not duplicated by even the most sophisticated 
electronic devices. If we innoculate one bacterial cell in a flask of beef broth in the morning, by 
the evening the flask will contain 5 billion cells. By increasing the volume of the vessel, 
enormous quantities of highly organised cells and their products can be generated from very 
simple starting materials. This productivity is not limited to plants and bacteria. One 
biotechnology strategy exploits the capacity of mammals to produce milk proteins; for example, 
Genzyme Transgenics has spliced into goat cells the human gene specifying blood clotting 
proteins ­ found in minute quantities in the blood. The resulting transgenic goats can generate 
large amounts of these otherwise rare proteins in their milk. Biotechnology permits the 
harnessing of the self reproducing capacity of organisms to the production of a vast variety of 
foodstuffs, medicines and fibres. The manufacturing component will eventually allow the 
production of biological devices in place of mechanical/electrical.6
<p>
	The application of biotechnology under fully democratic social and economic conditions 
would permit significant increases in productivity of food and other commodities, as well as 
major advances in the diagnosis of disease and the development of new therapeutic regimes. 
Unfortunately, the impact of biotechnology in the globalised capitalist economy is unlikely to 
realise this potential. Pharmaceutical, agricultural and biotech firms are moving aggressively, 
under the guise of free trade agreements, to privatise human animal and plant genomes, useful 
cell lines and agriculturally important crop plants and livestock. This effort to privatise life 
forms through the extension of patent protection represents a qualitatively new form of the 
private appropriation of social resources. The  resulting distortions of agricultural and health 
care development  are likely to bring the world's peoples increased risk to habitat, health and 
food supply.

<h3>
Historical patterns of ownership of plants and animals
</h3>

	Farmers have historically owned the cattle, pigs  and soybeans they raised themselves, 
but no farmer owned  the rights to the entire species, the ability to prevent others from raising 
the same stock. Large corporations may try to corner the market on distribution by buying up 
the crops of small producers, but until recently they have avoided the business of growing the 
crops themselves, or of owning the primary yield.
<p>
	Goodman and Redclift have described clearly the inability of British capital to establish 
industrial organisation patterns of ownership and exploitation in primary agricultural 
production.7  The uncertainties of biological and ecological processes, which depend on 
variables outside of industrial control---weather, disease and
drought---made it very difficult reliably to extract surplus value
from the growth of crops. In addition, it was difficult to control  
and limit production by others, given the widespread dissemination of agricultural knowledge 
and increasing acreage of arable land, both in the UK and abroad. By the 1870s, large 
capitalists had begun divesting themselves of the attempt to extract profit from agricultural 
production, and concentrated on processing, transport and marketing aspects.
<p>
	For the world's major crops, whether rice, corn, wheat, potato or cassava, primary 
production is still carried on by large numbers of small producers. Even in the fully 
industrialised US grain belt, the large commodity trading corporations such as Archer Daniels 
Midland or Cargill have stayed away from owning the farms directly.
<p>
	This inability to industrialise primary production remains true in the most vertically 
integrated sector of the agricultural economy, livestock production.  Although a very small 
number of corporations control the feedlots, slaughterhouses, processing, packaging and 
distribution, they eschew ownership of the steers on the hoof or the chickens in the bins.
<p>
	Thus, at present, despite global grain, corn, beef and fruit markets, primary agricultural 
production pattern is not dominated by large corporations. One consequence of this 
maintenance of food production (as opposed to processing and distribution) outside of 
monopoly ownership has been the inability of corporate grouping to raise the price of food 
crops as a source of super-profits. Much more frequent has been collusion in keeping prices 
paid to the farmer low  for both crops and livestock. Goodman and Redclift argue that food 
prices have historically been kept down as a means of maintaining social stability, keeping 
pressure off wages of industrial workers, in part through state intervention in support of 
agricultural production.8
<p>
	New efforts to privatise primary ownership of agriculturally important plants and 
animals  are now underway as a consequence of the biotech revolution. The current 
privatisation of crop species themselves and prospects of monopoly control of food production 
are taking place through the integration of seed companies, agrochemical industries, and 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, supported by radical changes in patent laws in 
the United States and the international extension of US-style intellectual property protection 
through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the recently formed World 
Trade Organization (WTO). Though these changes are enabled by the advances of 
biotechnology, they follow from the capitalist organisation of food production in a globalised 
economy, and not from any technological or scientific imperative.
<p><br>

<h3>
The impact of genetic engineering and biotechnology
</h3>

	The evolution of the extraordinary diversity of living creatures involved their 
segregation and separation into distinct species. Genes are the blueprints which specify the 
structures of the large molecules that form the living cells of organisms. Until recently, the 
exchange of genes between unrelated species has been limited by the biologically-evolved 
barriers to gene exchange that are necessary for the formation of species. Thus, in the normal 
course of evolution, the genes of corn do not mix with the genes of cows since these organisms 
neither mate with each other nor have other efficient means of recombining their genetic 
material. This separation or reproductive isolation means that corn plants produce kernels and 
cows produce milk proteins. Prior to the biotechnology revolution, it was not possible to tap 
the capacity of either organism to produce other foods or materials.
	Genetic engineering technology has now made it possible to cross these barriers so that 
the proteins of animals can be produced in plants and plant proteins in animals.  Genetic 
engineering permits the isolation of genes from almost any
organism---humans, clams, oak  trees, rattlesnakes---and their---splicing 
or transfer into the genetic apparatus of other organisms.  
Human insulin is now produced in bacteria. Cows, goats, sheep and pigs are also being 
modified genetically to produce a whole variety of human proteins.
<p>

	The information stored in genes is in the form of a linear sequence of the nucleotides 
that are linked together as long polymers to form DNA or its cousin RNA. The sequence along 
the gene specifies the sequence of amino acids that will be linked together to form the protein 
molecules that are the building blocks and machinery of cells. The identification of the 
nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino acid sequences of their encoded proteins is 
proceeding at an extraordinarily rapid pace. This has been sharply accelerated by the human and 
other genome projects.
<p>

	The application of biotechnology follows two stages. The first is the isolation of DNA 
from the cells of an organism, and the determination of the nucleotide sequence of particular 
regions of that DNA that represent genes. US and European patent offices have been granting 
patents on such sequences since the Chakrabarty decision (described below). The second stage 
is the introduction of these genes into cells of different species, or the modification of the genes 
and reintroduction back into the original species. In these cases, the living organisms have been 
genetically modified, providing one of the legal arguments for patentability ­ novelty. If the 
germ cells that provide the sperm or eggs for the next generation are modified, then the progeny 
of the original individual will also carry the modification. These are referred to as transgenic 
organisms.
<p>

	For pharmaceutical production technology, the most useful hosts are presently  single-
cell organisms which can be grown in a vat, such as bacteria or yeast, or cells isolated from 
higher organisms, but grown outside the body. Such cells reproduce by relatively simple cell 
division or budding processes. In agribusiness, the hosts for foreign genes are usually crop 
plants. In biomedical research and pharmaceutical development, transgenic mice, hamsters, 
goats, pigs and other animals are generated.
<p>
	The production of human insulin provides a useful example of the early application of 
biotechnology to the pharmaceutical industry. From 1930 to 1985, to provide enough insulin 
for the millions of insulin dependent diabetics, the pancreases of steers and hogs in the 
slaughterhouse were cut out of the carcasses. From hundreds of thousands of pancreases, the 
islet cells, representing less than 1per cent of the tissue mass, were dissected out and then diced 
up and the insulin isolated in a multistep process that, nationwide, required thousands of 
workers.
<p>
	Through the application of genetic engineering technology (often called recombinant 
DNA technology), the gene for human insulin has been spliced into bacteria. These cells are 
grown in 10,000 litre vats and produce 20 per cent of their mass as insulin. One Eli Lilly plant 
in Indianapolis produces sufficient human insulin for most of the US population of diabetics. 
Harnessing the intrinsic reproductive capacity of living organisms means there is no scarcity of 
insulin in the US or in the world. However, prices have not dropped significantly to reflect the 
new abundance. High prices have been maintained by a variety of barriers giving monopoly-
like control of the market; one of these barriers is patents on the gene sequences.

<h3>
The extension of patent law to living creatures and their components
</h3>

	A patent allows the owner to prevent others from using or benefiting from the patented 
invention, process or construct of matter without permission and without compensating the 
holder. When the patent is over a form of information, such as is encoded in human genes, the 
holder can prevent others from using this information. US patent law, by granting a monopoly 
for twenty years to the patent holders, allows a company to prevent other efforts to produce or 
utilise the 'invention', even if for medical purposes or human welfare. Most people associate 
patents with true inventions of machines, novel processes or chemical reactions. Over the last 
decade, private corporations have moved to extend the monopoly of ownership and use 
inherent in patents to genes, proteins, cell lines and even strains of organisms.
<p>
	The breeding, selection and manipulation of species of plants and animals dates back to 
the domestication of plants and animals and to the origin of agriculture. Financial speculation 
and corporate development of plant varieties were already well developed in the fifteenth 
century, as evidenced by Dutch investments in novel tulip strains. Though the contributions of 
breeders were recognised, these improved strains were not considered to be human inventions 
in the same sense as manufactured devices. Animal and plant species were excluded from the 
coverage of British and European patent law.
<p>
	The key modern efforts to profit from direct ownership of plant germplasm, rather than 
distribution of the product, began in the 1920s with privatisation of seed production and 
distribution in the grain belt of the US.9 This led to the proliferation and growth of seed 
companies such as Pioneer Hi-Bred, DeKalb Genetics and Funk Seeds. The best known 
innovation of this period was the development of hybrid corn. Hybrid corn is often presented 
as an advance of agricultural science. In fact, since the offspring of hybrid corn are not as 
productive as the parents, to obtain consistent high yields farmers need to purchase seed yearly 
from the originating companies. The switch to hybrid varieties displaced traditional varieties 
and rendered farmers more dependent on seed companies for next year's crop.
<p>
	Though successful and profitable, the seed companies were not able to keep other firms 
from developing hybrid strains and the market was divided. To try to gain monopoly control, 
seed companies and plant breeders joined efforts to obtain patent protection for certain food and 
ornamental plants in the 1920s. These efforts encountered resistance from farmers and 
consumers, leading to a compromise in which there was registration and copyright-like 
protection for ornamental plants and grafted fruit trees ­ the Townsend-Purnell Plant Patent Act 
of 1930. This legislation did not bring agricultural products under the existing patent laws but 
extended copyright protection to certain asexually reproduced plant varieties. A second effort 
occurred in the 1960s, leading to the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970, which further 
extended plant breeders' rights but still kept plants outside of conventional patent law. Recent 
amendments have continued to erode farmers' rights to save and plant seed.
<p>
	Similar legal changes were instituted in Europe. In 1961, pressure from seed companies 
led eight European nations to form the International Union for the Protection of Plant Varieties 
(UPOV). This was an effort to stiffen domestic plant variety protection laws among the 
signatory nations, on behalf of Europe's professional breeders. One particularly insidious 
aspect of these laws in a number of European states are national registration requirements, 
which make it illegal to plant seeds of varieties that are not registered, driving the farmer into 
further dependence on commercial varieties.10 But the protection afforded by the various 
regulatory regimes to the 'owners' of varieties was less than that accorded to holders of 
traditional utility patents, and the seed/biotechnology industry continued to press for more 
comprehensive intellectual property protection for engineered plants.
<p>
	US patent laws were originally written by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was an active 
plant breeder and corresponded with leading breeders in Europe. Nonetheless, the patent laws 
as developed by him excluded animals and plants from their coverage.11 Jefferson was clear 
that patents were a form of monopoly. The new nation had come into existence in part because 
of the recognition of the noxious aspects of monopoly practices. Jefferson believed the 
importance of the patent laws lay not in the generalised protection of private property, but in the 
limited and specific purpose of ensuring that creative and inventive individuals were able to 
make a living from their work, and thus continue to contribute to society. He wrote that 
whenever this monopoly was contrary to the public interest, the public interest would take 
precedence.12
<p>
	This two hundred-year-old legacy was breached in 1980 with the granting of patent 
protection for a genetically engineered bacterium by the US Supreme Court in Chakrabarty vs. 
US Patent and Trademark Office.13 The decision was very close (five to four) and was 
narrowly constructed with respect to genetically modified microorganisms. But it opened the 
flood gates, and soon Harvard Medical School scientists applied for, and were granted, a patent 
on a genetically modified mouse. Since then, US, British and European patent offices have 
issued thousands of patents on genes, plants, animals and even human cell lines. In the US, 
this process was carried on outside of public perception through the procedures of the Patent 
and Trademark Office. The transformation has never been addressed by the US Congress. 
Opposition has been much more developed in Europe, South-east Asia and South America (see 
below).
<p>
	The ability to modify organisms' genes, together with legal changes that extend patent 
protection to such modified organisms, has opened up the possibility of the ownership of entire 
species---not merely the individuals but all their progeny. Drug companies own patents on 
human cell lines and on thousands of human genes. Genentech owns patents on a variety of 
important human growth factors; Sequana Therapeutics has filed for patents on the cells and 
genes of indigenous tribes in New Guinea. Eli Lilly company owns the patent on the human 
insulin gene. They have the legal right to prevent other institutions (including non-profit 
organisations) from using the information in these genes for producing the corresponding 
proteins. Thus, though the technology for isolating the human insulin gene from human cells 
(skin, blood etc.) is widely distributed, anyone trying to produce insulin would be subject to 
infringement suits. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of such suits are brought regularly 
within the biotechnology industry as companies jockey for control of the patents.14 Perusal of 
issues of Biotechnology or other trade journals reveals the aggressive nature of the industry in 
protecting its intellectual property patents.
<p>
<br>

<h3>
Biotechnology and corporate control of food production
</h3>
	A key component of the development of agriculture some 10,000 years ago was the 
recognition that seed from one season's crop needed to be saved and planted to generate the 
next season's crop. Plant patenting means that any farmer who grows a genetically-engineered 
crop, saves seed from the crop, and plants saved seed is guilty of patent infringement. The 
saving of seed is, of course, normal farming practice throughout most of the world. 
Transnational 'life science' firms, as they like to call themselves, would like to curtail this 
practice. In the United States, Monsanto has used a combination of a legal contract with the 
farmer and patent protection to make sure that farmers pay it royalties on its genetically 
engineered varieties, every single cropping season. Around one hundred farmers who saved 
their genetically engineered seed last year were prosecuted by Monsanto.15
<p>	Policing intellectual property infringement at the international level is costly and 
difficult; some companies have been looking for biological means as well to protect their 
'inventions', and appropriate more of the agricultural surplus. United States Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) scientists, working with Delta and Pine Land, the world's largest cotton 
seed company (now owned by Monsanto) have developed genetically modified crops whose 
seed can be eaten, but cannot be propagated. The <a
href="http://www.rafi.org/">Rural Advancement Foundation International</a>  
(RAFI) is calling this gene package 'the terminator'. 16
<p>
	The lead scientist, in quite patriotic fashion, claims that his main reason for working on 
the 'terminator' project is to protect American inventions abroad. Says primary inventor Melvin 
Oliver, of the USDA:
<blockquote>
 My main interest is the protection of American technology...The need was there 
to come up with a system that allowed you to self-police your technology, other 
than trying to put on laws and legal barriers to farmers saving seed, and to try 
and stop foreign interests [read foreign farmers saving seed] from stealing the 
technology. 
</blockquote>
The targets of this technology are none other than the farmers of the developing world. 
According to Willard Phelps, spokesman for the USDA, the goal is 'to increase the value of 
proprietary seed owned by US seed companies and to open up new markets in Second and 
Third World countries'.17
<p>
<br>

<h3>
Use of trade agreements to globalise intellectual property rights
</h3>

	After the domestic court decisions legalising life patenting, the pharmaceutical and 
agrotechnology interests mobilised the United States government to export its intellectual 
property system to the rest of the world, by having it included as a side agreement to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Corporate leadership was provided by the 
self-selected Intellectual Property Committee, consisting of Bristol-Myers, DuPont, General 
Electric, General Motors, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Monsanto, 
Pfizer, Rockwell and Time-Warner. 
<p>
	During the Uruguay Round of GATT, US negotiators put a proposal on the table  for 
the expansion of GATT's scope to include, inter alia, intellectual property rights (IPR). 
These had formerly been dealt with at the international level within the United Nation¹s World 
Intellectual Property Organisation. But the United States has always had much greater 
international influence in the less democratic international institutions, such as the UN Security 
Council, the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund)  
and GATT. And, by bringing intellectual property into GATT (which has been turned into a 
formal institution, the World Trade Organisation), and thereby linking the previously distinct 
areas of trade and intellectual property protection, the US could legitimise its practice of 
imposing economic sanctions on countries whose intellectual property regimes do not 
'effectively' protect the intellectual property of US firms.
<p>
	Intellectual property rights over life forms have been inserted into GATT in the side 
agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or the TRIPs agreement. 
This requires countries to develop national legislation establishing the patentability of micro-
organisms, but not plants or animals. Plants must be covered by some type of intellectual 
property protection, though not necessarily utility patents (as in the United States) which afford 
the greatest amount of monopoly protection to the companies that hold the patents. However, 
US negotiators, responding to agribusiness pressure, will seek utility patent protection for 
plants during the forthcoming 1999 review of the TRIPs agreement.
<p>
	Until recently, in Brazil, India, Canada and other countries, production of 
pharmaceuticals and medicinals has been protected from interference by patent monopolies.  
New power acquired through the TRIPs agreement has made it possible for the US to pressure 
these countries for domestic changes.  While there are clearly reasons why nations would want 
to protect sectors so important to public health from the pharmaceutical monopolies, US trade 
officials use the TRIPs agreement to intrude on these domestic decisions.  Ironically, the 
forcing open of domestic policies to international dictates closes off the sectors to monopoly 
arrangements.
<p>
<br>

<h3>
From plant patents to agricultural monopolies
</h3>

	Obtaining patents on genetically modified organisms is only the first step and certainly 
does not by itself guarantee monopoly control of the organisms. The conventional strains have 
to be displaced or competition from them limited. This type of displacement has been well 
documented in the case of hybrid corn and the rice strains associated with the Green 
Revolution.18 It is not possible to predict the paths that agribusiness will take in this new phase 
of displacement, but in a number of markets the initial shape of the campaigns can be glimpsed. 
Krimsky and Wrubel have analysed the development and marketing of Monsanto's Round-Up 
Ready Soybean.19 These soybeans have been engineered to be resistant to the chemical 
herbicide Round-Up, so that higher levels of the herbicide can be applied to fields. In recent 
years applications have averaged 500,000,000 pounds a year, a staggering level. More than 90 
per cent of soybean, corn and cotton acreage are treated with Round-Up as well as 50 per cent 
of wheat. Given the accumulation of herbicide residues, it may not be difficult to convince 
farmers that they need Round-Up resistant seed or, in fact, to create a situation where this is 
true. 
<p>
	The  recent introduction of boll weevil-resistant cotton Bollgard¹ provides another 
example. Monsanto played on farmer's fears of boll weevil infection. Some 2.5 million acres 
were planted with  this genetically engineered patented cotton variety  in 1996.20 Ironically, a 
major boll weevil outbreak occurred in 1997, and the 'resistant' cotton proved relatively 
susceptible, setting back Monsanto's strategy. However, it is likely that this setback is only 
temporary. Krimsky and Wrubel identify some twenty agrotechnology firms engaged in the 
development of herbicide resistant crops. Patents will be granted on many of these genetically 
engineered varieties. 
<p>
	Given the penetration of the market by patented strains, it is not difficult to imagine 
circumstances where dependence develops, allowing sharp increases in the price of the patented 
varieties. 
<p>
<br>

<h3>
Economic restructuring of agricultural transnationals
</h3>

	Evidence of the significance of plant IPR to capital can be seen in the massive buy-outs 
of seed firms by transnational agrochemical companies, starting in the 1970s. If the only value 
in the seed were its present exchange value, the large transnationals would not be racing to 
purchase seed companies. This trend continues with recent acquisitions of major seed 
companies by firms like Monsanto. Over the course of the last few years, Monsanto has spent 
no less than $6 billion in acquisitions, buying one of the world's largest cotton seed 
companies, the world's eighth largest corn seed company, Cargill's international seed division, 
and the former British Plant Breeding Institute (auctioned off during Thatcher's reign and a 
leading wheat seed repository).21 Monsanto is now the second largest seed company in the 
world.22 It is estimated that Monsanto and Dupont alone now control half of the US soy and 
corn markets; Monsanto currently controls 85 per cent of the US cotton seed market. 23 
Through other recent acquisitions, Monsanto has garnered 30 per cent of the maize market in 
Brazil and 40 per cent of the Argentine market. Mergers and alliances between these already 
colossal companies are also taking place, such as the $34.4 billion acquisition of Monsanto by 
American Home Products/American Cyanamid.
<p>
	The patents make the seed companies more significant investments. Through the buy-
out of an arm of W.R. Grace, Agracetus, Monsanto has patents on all soybeans (except in the 
United States) and all cotton that will be genetically engineered during the next decade and a 
half. By owning the largest seed companies, biotechnology firms like Monsanto will, in the 
near future, have an enormous amount of control over what crop varieties will be sold ­ all 
over the world.  By holding the patents on the crop seeds being sold, the firms will have 
control over how much farmers will pay for those seeds, and how often they will have to buy 
seeds.
<p>
	These same companies also tend to be involved in pharmaceuticals as well. The merger 
of American Home Products and Monsanto created the largest agrochemical firm in the world, 
as well as the world's fourth largest pharmaceutical firm.
<p>
<br>

<h3>
Consequences for developed and developing world
</h3>

	For most farmers, seed is not something that is bought, but something that is created by 
use of the natural resources of water, soil and sun, with the addition of farmer knowledge. The 
seed is a means of production, a means to produce more seed. In addition, the seed is a means 
of reproduction, for the fruit of the seed is the sustenance of the farmer and his or her family. 
Intellectual property rights have the potential to rob peasants of their livelihood, for patents 
place monopoly control over that essential aspect of material reproduction:  the seed. It will be a 
serious intrusion into the life of the rural agriculturist if, by biological or legal mechanisms, he 
or she is to be forced into the seed market every year.
<p>
	The international laws that facilitate capital's control over the seed may also lead to the 
appropriation of the culture of farming communities. Basmati rice and jasmine rice are integral 
to the culture and agriculture (including export agriculture) of India and Thailand, respectively. 
Recall the patent granted to Rice-Tec, Inc (US patent #5,663,484) on basmati rice that is grown 
anywhere in the western hemisphere. Not only has the genetic information been claimed, but 
also the name and the cultural significance. Not long after the patent was granted, a trademark 
was granted for the name 'jasmati', to be used on a type of jasmine rice.24 
<p>
	The knowledge and culture, and here the two are inseparable, that have developed these 
varieties of rice have been stolen.  In the jargon of the biotechnology industry, this knowledge 
has been acquired through 'bioprospecting'. Peasants and non-governmental organisations 
have another word for this acquisition, which they see as illegal.  They call it 'biopiracy'.25
<p>
<br>

<h3>
Impacts of biomedical patents
</h3>

	The initial extension of patent law to gene sequences and cell lines was driven by the 
pharmaceutical market.26  Since competition is suppressed through patents, new drugs and 
diagnostics can be sold at inflated prices. This is one of the reasons that the new therapies 
derived from biotechnology continue to be  expensive, despite the leaps in productivity 
available through biotechnology.
<p>	An additional but less visible effect following from the patenting of genes and cell lines 
is the distortion in the priorities of biomedical research and the health care system.27 
Profitability depends on selling a product that is protected by intellectual property laws. 
However, in many cases the key public health step is to identify the aetiology of the disease and 
prevent it; for example, by identifying carcinogens and removing them from the ecosystem. But 
this is not compatible with securing super-profits by selling people with cancer a palliative or 
therapeutic drug. Thus, Myriad Pharmaceutical could use its breast cancer gene technology to 
identify environmental or occupational carcinogens that cause the damage found in the genes of 
individuals with breast cancer. Instead, it is using its technology and patent rights to sell a 
diagnostic test which informs the individual how much damage has already occurred in their 
genome. Exploiting patents requires selling consumers a product, not keeping them from 
contracting disease.
<p>
	The profitability of the insulin market is dependent on millions of people being affected 
by the disease. Despite the very large biomedical research community focused on diabetes, 
research on what causes the damage to the insulin-producing or sensing cells is limited. Yet 
there are a flood of studies on managing the patient in terms of diet factors, genetics and 
behaviour. These distortions represent insidious long term economic influences on the medical 
community, rather than the limitations of biomedical science.
<p>
	Contrary to the claims of patent lawyers, patenting retards progress in biomedical 
research, introducing secrecy where openness is essential, and slows the publication and 
sharing of important results. Once a result is reported publicly, it cannot be patented.28 Thus 
researchers drawn into the web of the patent process do not report their results, even 
informally, until they have successfully passed through the slow, expensive patent application 
and granting process. Some of these barriers have recently been explored by Heller and  
Eisenberg.29
<p>
	Corporations claim that, without patent protection, important technologies will not be 
developed. In fact, what patent protection ensures is not technological development, but super-
profits. Patents are as often used to prevent the development of new technologies as to exploit 
them. The role of patents as a mechanism of monopoly pricing rather than technology 
development has been described in a number of sectors of industry, including antibiotics.
<p>
	Corporate interests argue that venture capital is harder to raise in the absence of patent 
protection. In those cases where a therapeutic development is not going forward because of 
problems in raising capital, though, the capital can be raised through public agencies. For 
example, vaccines for humans have often been avoided by the pharmaceutical industry, since a 
few doses provide protection for a lifetime, and liability issues can be serious. In contrast, 
many firms produce agricultural vaccines for cattle, sheep and pigs since these are slaughtered 
each year, and new populations are grown up requiring vaccination in turn ­ a much more 
profitable market. In these cases, the public sector is fully capable of filling the gap. The US 
Center for Disease Control oversees the production of a number of vaccines, and the National 
Institute of Health brought the anti-tumour agent, taxol, into production as an experimental 
drug before the pharmaceutical industry recognised its market potential.
Resisting corporate ownership of life forms
<p>
	In Europe, South-east Asia and South America, there are significant social movements 
opposing life patents.  Dramatic public demonstrations occurred in India in response to W. R. 
Grace's obtaining patents on the Neem tree, and these were followed by a vigorous battle in the 
India's upper parliament to resist the GATT intellectual property requirements.30 Peasant 
farmers are struggling to maintain control over the material basis of their livelihood, the 
agricultural crop plants on which they depend. They are also struggling to maintain control over 
their culture, as represented in the knowledge of producing and using rice. 
<p>
	 It is from these farming communities of the world, in particular in the developing 
world, that much of the resistance is emanating.  At the Second Ministerial Conference of the 
World Trade Organisation in Geneva, peasants from a global movement called Via Campesina 
were in attendance. Their press release, issued at the Ministerial Conference, stated:  
The Via Campesina is demanding  ... governments and ... international institutions ...  
prohibit biopiracy and patents on life (animal, plants, parts of human body) including 
the development of sterile varieties through genetic engineering.  
<p>
	
Some of the strongest resistance to life patents has come from indigenous peoples.  Because of 
their potential genetic uniqueness, they have been the brunt of much poking and swabbing, for 
blood and cells. And the cells of a number of indigenous individuals have been patented ­ by 
the United States Department of Commerce.  The 'Declaration of Indigenous Peoples of the 
Western Hemisphere Regarding the Human Genome Diversity Project' has a worldview clearly 
different from that of the officials in the US Patent and Trademark Office: 
We oppose the patenting of all natural genetic materials. We hold that life cannot be bought, 
owned, sold, discovered or patented, even in its smallest form...  We denounce and identify 
the instruments of intellectual property rights patent law ... as tools of legalized western 
deception and theft. We denounce all instruments of economic apparatus such as NAFTA, 
GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO) which continue to exploit people and natural 
resources to profit powerful corporations assisted by governments and military forces of 
developed countries.
<p>
	The European Parliament, responding to the initiatives of the Greens, refused to accept 
patents on genes. The first vote on such legislation a few years ago ended in a decision against 
patents on life. Only the full mobilisation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology forces in 1997 
led to the defeat of this effort. 
<p>
	As noted above, in 1999 there will be a review of the TRIPs agreement within the 
WTO, specifically to revisit the provisions that exempt plants from utility patent protection. 
Developed countries, led by the United States, will attempt to insert a form of words requiring 
member states to grant utility patents on plants. There will be a significant amount of resistance 
to this attempt, at both the governmental and non-governmental levels.
<p>
	In the United States and Canada both religious  and secular coalitions have taken clear 
positions in opposition to life patents. The Blue Mountain Declaration of June 1995 speaks for 
many:
<blockquote>
The humans, animals, microorganisms and plants comprising life on earth are part of the 
natural world into which we were all born. The conversion of these life forms, their molecules 
or parts into corporate property through patent monopolies is counter to the interests of the 
peoples of the world.
</blockquote>
No individual, institution, or corporation should be able to claim ownership over species or 
varieties of living organisms. Nor should they be able to hold patents on organs, cells, genes or 
proteins, whether naturally occurring, genetically altered or otherwise modified.
Indigenous peoples, their knowledge and resources are the primary target for the 
commodification of genetic resources. We call upon all individuals and organisations to 
recognise these peoples' sovereign rights to self-determination and territorial rights, and to 
support their efforts to protect themselves, their lands and genetic resources from 
commodification and manipulation.
Life patents are not necessary for the conduct of science and technology, and may in fact retard 
or limit any benefits which could result from new information, treatments or products ...
As part of a world movement to protect our common living heritage, we call upon the world 
and the congress of the United States to enact legislation to exclude living organisms and their 
component parts from the patent system. We encourage all peoples to oppose this attack on the 
value of life.31

<h3>
Future prospects
</h3>

	The plants, animals and microbes that form the interconnected web of life on Earth have 
evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Though some of them may have been modified by 
human intervention, the alterations are trivial with respect to the substrate. These species are too 
important for the continuation of life to be the property of corporations, individual institutions 
or political entities.
<p>
	The remedy  is straightforward. The very recent extension of patent protection to 
organisms, genes and cells needs to be stopped and reversed. The parliamentary battles that 
have occurred in India and Europe, and in Switzerland, Germany and Austria need to be 
expanded to other nations. Since the agri-biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are using 
the US government as a major lever in world affairs, it is particularly important that this effort 
develop in the US and its biotechnology allies: Canada, the UK, France and Germany. The 
appropriate action is for parliaments to clarify the law with further legislation that excludes 
living organisms and their parts from patent protection. The development of such issues in the 
US Congress will probably depend on the emergence in the US of political parties independent 
of the existing two parties.
<p>
	The animals and plants that have evolved on the Earth---like the oceans and the 
atmosphere---are the common heritage of all. Similarly, the genes that are the blueprints and 
instructions in our cells are shared by all human beings, since we are members of one species, 
homo sapiens. Allowing corporations to patent---to gain monopoly ownership of organisms 
and their components---means that life forms are being converted into corporate property. This 
constitutes a vast new form of privatisation on a global scale. The struggle to maintain species 
as part of the common heritage of human society, allowing equitable utilisation of their bounty, 
will be an increasingly important social and economic struggle as we enter the twenty-first 
century.
