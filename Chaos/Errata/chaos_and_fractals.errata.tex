\noindent Most of these errata are typos or punctuation mishaps that
do not affect the meaning of the text.  Errors that are significant
enough that they might cause confusion (as opposed to mere annoyance)
are indicated with a $\bigstar$.\\ 

\noindent {\bf Errata from the First Impression:}

\begin{itemize}

  \item {\bf page 15:} Exercise 1.11(c) should read ``In 1985 {\bf
    there} are $20$ rabbits on the island.'' 

  \item {\bf page 31:}  In the second paragraph, the third line should
    read: ``... to observe or encounter {\bf an} unstable fixed point,
    ...''

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 32:}  Exercise 3.10(d) should read:
    ``What do your answers to the above two questions let you conclude
    about the stability of the fixed point $x= {\bf -4}$?''

  % I'm somewhat inconsistent about the use of x^* for fixed point

%  \item Page 55.  paragraph 3, sentence 4.  replace ``initial
%    population times $r^t$'' with ``initial population multiplied by
%    $r^t$.''  Not an error.  Just a way to make it more clear. 

  \item {\bf page 61:} Seventh line from the bottom of the page should
    read ``affecting the rabbits'' not ``effecting the rabbits.''

  \item {\bf page 65:} Exercise 7.6(c) should read: ``What does the
    slope {\bf of} this line suggest about the stability of the fixed
    point at $x=\frac{1}{3}${\bf ?}''

  \item {\bf page 67:}  Issac Newton should be Isaac Newton.  The
    spelling of Isaac is also wrong in the index, page 406.

  \item {\bf page 77:}  The first sentence should read ``In Chapter
    7...'' 

  \item {\bf page 78:}  The seventh line of text should read ``...to a
    phase line{\bf .} {\bf H}owever, on this sort...''

  \item {\bf pages 84--86:} References to $r=4$ should be changed to
    $r=4.0$. 

  \item {\bf page 85:}  The last line on the page should read ``...the
    rule is just the function that {\bf is iterated}.''

  \item {\bf page 86:}  Line six should read: ``...we keep seeing new
    numbers.  {\bf This} was the case...'' 

  \item {\bf page 86:} First line of the third full paragraph should
    read ``...that the dynamical system display{\bf s}.''

  \item {\bf page 86:} Sixth line of the third full paragraph should
    read ``...in a relatively short time.  {\bf S}ensitive
    dependence...'' 

  \item {\bf page 96:}  In the last line of the first paragraph,
    ``iteratations'' should be ``iterations''.  % my fault

  \item {\bf page 102:}  Exercise 10.2 should read ``In Table 10.3 are 
    shown the first {\em seven} iterates...''

  \item {\bf page 107:} The last line of the second paragraph should
    read ``...to ordered, period{\bf ic} regions.'' %the copyeditor
                                %did not catch this.

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 111:}  Two sentences before Eq.~(11.3).  The
    sentence should read: ``The {\bf last} number in Sharkovsky
    ordering is $2^0 = 1$.''  (Thanks to Allan Duncan for catching
    this.) 

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 113:}  Equation (11.6) should read:
$$
\delta_2 \, = \, \frac{ r_3 - r_2}{r_4 - r_3} \;\;.
$$

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 116:}  The second sentence of the last
    paragraph should read: ``For the cubic equation, the bifurcation
    from period $1$ to period $2$ occurs at around ${\bf r=5.25}$.
(Thanks to Joel Gottlieb for catching this.)


  \item {\bf page 129:}  Second paragraph, line 6.  Insert a space
    between ``pp.''  and ``61--66''.

  \item {\bf page 141:}  The sentence immediately after Eq.~(14.1)
    should read: ``There {\bf is} an infinite number of numbers...''

  \item {\bf page 146:}  Second paragraph, line 4 should read ``there
    are lots {\bf and} lots of other...'' %not caught by copyeditor

  \item {\bf page 146:} paragraph 3, line 1 should read ``There {\bf
    is} an infinite number of possible algorithms.  There {\bf is}
    also...'' %karin N suggests this change.  i think it could be is
              %or are.  not sure which way to go. 

  \item {\bf page 147:} The first line on the page should read
    ``...there {\bf is} an infinite...''

  \item {\bf page 151:} The sixth line from the bottom of the page
    should read: ``the propert{\bf y} of the pints...''

  \item {\bf page 157:}  The fifth line should read ``the sorts {\bf
    of} dynamical systems...'' 

  \item {\bf page 164:}  Fifth line from the bottom, deleted repeated
    instance of ``other.'' %not caught by copyeditor

  \item {\bf page 173:}  The second line in the second paragraph
    should read ``which was the subject of Exercise {\bf 16.4}, is
    generated as follows.''  %I introduced this error.  I'm not sure
                             %how. 

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 180:}  The fifth line of the second
  paragraph should read ``...in the dark shaded triangle in the lower
  {\bf right} of Fig.~17.14.'' 

  \item {\bf page 196:}  The fifth line from the bottom should read
    ``as shown in {\bf Table 19.1}.''  

  \item {\bf page 197:}  The second sentence in the caption for
    Fig.~19.1 should read ``...the average winning line become{\bf s}
    less jumpy...'' %copyeditor did not catch this

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 199:}  In Table 192.  The column titled
    Total Winnings should read $4, 8, 12, {\bf 14},$ $ {\bf 16}, 48, 64,
    \ldots$.  

  \item {\bf page 199:}  The second to last line from the bottom of
    the page should read ``...the average winning may have been
    approaching $5$.''  (I.e., delete ``were''.)  %I introduced this
                                %error somehow. 

  \item {\bf page 202:}  The last sentence of side-note 2 should read:
    ``However, it is worth {\bf noting} that ... .''  (Thanks to Julio
    Cesar Campos Neto for finding this error.)

  \item {\bf page 212:} The first sentence of the second paragraph
    should read ``Let us illustrate this process {\bf using} two
    sentences written by...'' %I introduced this error 

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 212:} In Figure 20.8, the graph is wrong
    for word frequencies of $5$ and $6$.  The line should be twice as
    high, indicating that there is one word that occurs $5$ times and
    one word that occurs $6$ times.  As it stands, the graph indicates
    that there is half a word that occurs $5$ times and half a word
    that occurs $6$ times, which makes no sense. 

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 213:}  Note that the histograms in
    Figs.~20.9 and 20.10 are normalized.  

  % page 213.  First instance of the greek letter alpha. 

  \item {\bf page 215:}  The seventh line in the first paragraph of
    Section 20.4 should read ``...power-law distribution, $p(x) = {\bf
      A}x^{_2}$.  I.e., to be consistent with Eq.~(20.5), the constant
    in the equation should be $A$, not $C$. 

  \item {\bf page 215:}  Note that the histogram in Fig.~20.15 is
    normalized. 

  \item {\bf page 221:}  The sixth line of the first paragraph should
    read ``This is the focus of this chapter, {\bf which} has a
    somewhat different...''  (The version in the text is grammatically
    correct, but is somewhat stilted.) 

  \item {\bf page 225:}  There is an ambiguity in the first
    paragraph.  I write that the unit interval consists of all
    numbers between $0$ and $1$.  However, in Eq.~(21.17) I write that
    the unit interval is ${\cal L} = [0,1]$.  The square brackets mean
    that the endpoints---i.e. $0$ and $1$ ---are included in ${\cal
      L}$.  So I should have written that the unit interval consists
    of all numbers that are greater than or equal to $0$, but are less
    than or equal to $1$.  

  %P 222, Table 21.1, column 2:  it would make the progression from
  %‘1’ towards '2 to the nth power' clearer if you included ‘2 to
  %the power of zero = 1’, ‘2 to the power of one = 2’, ‘2 squared
  %= 4’, ‘2 cubed = 8’.  (Incidentally, the number sign (#) is not
  %generally used in the UK; ‘No.’ would be used instead.  I am
  %American and thus familiar with your usage.)  comments from karin. 

  %P 222.  second to last line of paragraph two.  delete the second
  %instance of 'will', so the sentence begins ``We then.. `` comment
  %from karin.  not sure i agree. 

  \item {\bf page 224:}  In the second line from the bottom of the
    page there is a bit too much space between the comma and the ``0''
    in $100,000$. 

  \item {\bf page 229}.  In the last line of the third paragraph there
    is too much space between ``unit'' and ``interval.''  %this is a
                                %mix-up that i introduced when adding
                                %indexing commands.

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 230:}  The seventh line of the second
    paragraph should read ``...start with ${\bf 0.0}$ lie in the first
    third...'' 

  \item {\bf page 231:}  the seventh line from the bottom of the page
    should read ``... \sout{the} an infinite size, but...''%the
                                %copyeditor missed this

  \item {\bf page 232:} The fifth line of the last paragraph on the
    page should read ``...contains {\bf a} general discussion...''
    %copyeditor missed this 

  \item {\bf page 232:}  In the ninth line of the last paragraph,
    delete the comma after ``Barrow's''. %copyeditor missed this 

  \item {\bf page 242:}  The fourth line after Eq.~(23.5) should read
    ``...but it is possible you will encounter \sout{them} {\bf it}
    elsewhere.'' 

  \item {\bf page 244:}  The first line on the page should read
    ``...and the angle, {\bf in a counter-clockwise direction} between
    the {\bf positive} horizontal axis and a line drawn from the
    origin to the point $z$.  (What is in the text is not wrong, but
    is potentially ambiguous.)

  \item {\bf page 246:}  The last line of the caption for Fig.~23.5
    should read ``$w = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i$, $w^{\bf 2} =
    -0.5$. 

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 249:} The second line above Eq.~(24.1)
    should read ``$z_0 = (r_0 = 2, \theta_0 =  {\bf 15})$.''

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 251:} Eq.~(24.5) should read:
\begin{eqnarray}
  0.8 + 0.2i & \longrightarrow & -0.4 + 0.32i \; \longrightarrow \;
  -0.942 - 0.256i\\
& & -0.178 + 0.482i \; \longrightarrow \; -1.201 - 0.172i \;
 \cdots \;.
\end{eqnarray}
The next line should read: ``Although it is not immediately apparent,
this orbit does eventually tend toward infinity.  (The 15$^{\rm th}$
iterate is $-2078.3 - 5290.4i$.)''

  \item {\bf page 252:}  The second sentence in the caption of
    Fig.~24.5 should read ``This is a close-up of {\bf the} boxed
    region of the Julia set... .''
% OUP Copyeditor missed this.

\item {\bf page 253:}  The caption for Fig.~24.6 should read ``The
  Julia set for the function $f(z) = z^2 {\bf +} 0.84i$.'' (I.e., ``$+$''
  not ``$-$''.)

\item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 255:}  Exercise 24.6.  The values given in
  the exercise are correct; they do indeed correspond to the eight
  Julia sets shown on page 256.  However, several online Julia-set
  programs produce images that are flipped along a vertical axis.  These
  programs may be using the function $f(z) = z^2 - c$ (instead of
  $+c$), or they may simply be rendering the images wrong.  The Julia
  set program that is part of WolframAlpha is reliable and renders
  images correctly.  I recommend using this program.  It can be found
  at: \url{http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=julia+set}. 

\item {\bf page 259:}  Line $7$ in the second paragraph should read
  ``... it can still take \sout{a} some time.'' %this is my fault

\item {\bf page 259:}  Table 25.2.  The minus signs appear as hyphens.
  They should be longer.  Also, there is no need for the $+$ in the
  entry for $z_t$ at time $4$.
  % The problem with the minus signs is that I didn't put the numbers
  % in math mode.  
  % The OUP editor didn't catch this. 

  % In Table 25.3, 0 should be 0.0.  It should also be 0.0 in the
  % first sentence of paragraph 4 on page 259

  % Top of page 260:  0 should be 0.0.

  \item {\bf page 261:} The third sentence of the caption for
    Fig.~25.5 should read ``The initial condition $z_0 = 0$ was
    iterated for each \sout{the} $c$ value.''
    % OUP editor did not catch this. 

  \item {\bf page 262:}  Marginal note 3 should read ``A good,
    elementary introduction to Mandelbrot set graphics is Rood
    (2004).'' %This one is my fault.

  \item {\bf pages 262--3:}  The first line in the caption for all
    four figures on these two pages should read: ``A plot of a portion
    {\bf of} the Mandelbrot set.'' % The OUP copyeditor missed this.

  \item {\bf page 263:}  The first line should read ``Having enjoyed a
    journey through parts of {\bf the} Mandelbrot set.''
  % this error is my fault. 

  \item {\bf page 263:} The last line of the first paragraph should
    read ``...a listing of all the $c$ values that have a connected
    Julia set\sout{s}.''

   % page 266.  line two should read:  ``branch off this portion''
   % i.e., delete ``of''.

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 264:} Table 25.4 should read:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c r}

$55$ & $0.015 - 0.035i$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 267:}  Table 25.5.  The caption should
    read ``The orbit of $f(z) = z^2 + c$, for $c = {\bf -0.157 + 1.031i}$.

  \item {\bf page 267:}  Table 25.5 should read:

$53$ &  $-1.196 + 0.707i$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



  % page 268.  first paragrapgh, line 5.  should read ``spiral off the
  % bulbs''  Not ``spiral off OF the bulbs.''

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 274:} Fig.~26.1.  The second sentence of
    the caption should read ``The itinerary approaches the
    \sout{fixed point at $x=1$} period-two points at $x=0.513$ and 
    $x=0.799$. 

  \item {\bf page 275:} The last line in Table 26.2 should have a time
    of $3$, not $2$.

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 276:}  The second line above Fig.~26.4
    should read ``The $x$ part of the orbit oscillates between $2.49$
    and \sout{$0.83$} {\bf $0.083$}.'' 

%  \item Page 277.  The arrow are barely visible on Fig 26.5.

  \item {\bf page 277:}  The first sentence of the caption for
    Fig.~26.5 should read ``... under the H\'enon map with $a = $
    \sout{$0.115$} {\bf $0.155$}.''

%  \item {\bf page 277:}  The caption for Fig.~26.5 should read ``A
%    plot of the itinerary of the initial condition $x_0 = 1$, $y_0 =
%    2$ under the H\'enon map with $a = {\bf 0.155}$ and $b=0.6$.

  \item {\bf pages 278 and 279:}  The first sentence of the captions
    for both Fig.~26.9 and 26.10 should read ``Time series plots of
    the $x$- and $y$-itineraries for the initial condition $x_0 =$
    \sout{$1$} {\bf $0.6$}, $y_0 =$ \sout{$2$} {\bf $0.6$}... .''

  % Page 282.  Delete the last sentence of the caption for Fig 26.16.
  % It is redundant.

  \item {\bf pages 282 and 283:}  In both Fig.~26.17 and 26.18, the
    first initial condition is $(-0.514651, ${\bf+}$0.297419)$.  

  \item {\bf page 283:}  The second to last sentence in the first
    paragraph should read ``This is hard to see on the time series
    plots of Figs.~26.17 \sout{and 26.17}.''

  % page 284.  Exercise 26.4, Equation 26.13 should be -\frac{1}{2}.
  % I.e., put the minus in front of the fraction. 

  \item {\bf page 288:} The second to last line on the page should
    read ``...system in which a grid of discrete variables
    \sout{which} are updated... .''

  \item {\bf page 289:} Paragraph three, line six should read
    ``...down the page instead of {\bf across}, and instead ... .'' 
  % The OUP copyeditor missed this.

  % The OUP copyeditor missed this. 

  \item {\bf page 295:} Paragraph two, line two should read
    ``...behavior {\bf is} beyond the scope of... .''
  % The OUP copyeditory missed this. 

  \item {\bf pages 298--300:}  Section 27.5.  The way I explain the
    naming convention for CAs is correct, but non-standard.  My method
    yields the same names as the standard method, but readers may find
    the standard method more straightforward.  The two methods are
    discussed in a separate document, available at
    \url{http://chaos.coa.edu/ca_naming_conventions.pdf}. 

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 299:} Equation (27.4) should read:
\begin{equation}
  101 \, = \, (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + ({\bf 1} \times 2^0)
  \, = \, 4 + 0 + 1 \, = \, 5 \;.

    ``... as was the case for ${\bf K}=2$, {\bf $r=2$} CA... .''

  \item {\bf page 306:}  In the first line after Section 28.3 heading,
    insert a comma after ``i.e.''
  % OUP missed this

  \item {\bf page 306:}  The sixth line from the bottom of the page
    should read ``is 40 {\bf degrees} warmer than room temperature it
    will cool twice as fast \sout{as} {\bf than} if it is 20 degrees
    warmer... .''
  % OUP missed these

  \item {\bf page 306:}  Note 2.  It is {\bf Isaac} Netwon, not
    Issac.  $\frownie$

  % Page 307.  second to last line in the second paragraph should
  % perhaps read ``The better the *cup's* insulation, the more
  % slowly... .''

  \item {\bf page 307:}  In Table 28.2, the cooling rate at time $4$
    should be $-4.92$, not $-4.91$.  

  \item {\bf page 308:}  Paragraphs 3 and 4.  Each instance of the
    word ``second'' or ``seconds'' should be changed to ``minute'' or
    ``minutes.'' 

  \item {\bf page 309:}  Eq.~(28.10), the right hand side should be
    $-6$ {\bf C}, not $-6$ min.

  \item {\bf page 310:} Note 4.  Euler's first name is Leon{\bf h}ard,
    not Leonard.
  % I also need to change this in the index. 

  \item {\bf page 310:}  Note 5 should read ``Compare this with
    Eq.~(28.12), which we repeated{\bf ly} used to approximate... .''

  \item {\bf page 312:}  The sentences after Eq.~(28.20) should read
    ``This can be thought of as the differential equation version {\bf
    of} the logistic equation.  The population in {\bf this} instance
    varies continuously... .''
  % OUP missed both of these

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 312:}  In Exercise 28.7(d).  $\Delta t =
    0.5$, not $0.0$.   

  \item $\bigstar$ {\bf page 312:}  The right-hand sides of
    Eqs.~(28.20) and (28.21) should have $f(t)$ and not $f(x)$.  (Or
    the left-hand side should be $\frac{df}{dx}$.)

  \item {\bf page 315:}  The caption for Fig.~29.3 should read ``The
    phase line for the differential equation of Eq.~(29.{\bf 4}).'' 

  \item {\bf page 322:}  The third sentence after Eq.~(30.2) should
    read ``The negative sign in front of this term\sout{s} indicates
    that... .''
  % OUP missed this

  \item {\bf page 322:}  The last sentence in the second paragraph
    should read ``The larger $b$ is, the more deadly \sout{are} {\bf

  % Page 324.  To be consistent, I should probably write the first
  % equation in Eq. (30.7) as dR/dt = R = 0.5 RF.  (I use 0.5 and not
  % 1/2 everywhere else on the page.) 

  \item {\bf page 327:}  The tenth line from the bottom of the page
    should read ``...behavior of the populations \sout{are} {\bf is}
    cyclic.''

  \item {\bf page 328:}  The second sentence in the caption of
    Fig.~30.4 should read ``The trajectories for three different
    initial conditions \sout{is} {\bf are} shown.''

  % Page 330.  Second to last line on the page.  Put parentheses
  % around the point 0.1, 0.1.  I.e., is should be (0.1, 0.1).

  % Page 331.  First line of the page.  Put brackets around the point
  % so it reads (3, 3). 

  % \item {\bf Page 333:}  In the captions for Figs.~30.11 and 30.12, it 
  % should read "Exercise", not "problem".

  \item {\bf page 333:}  In Exercise 30.4, both instances of
    ``Fig.~30.4'' should read ``Fig.~30.13.''

  \item {\bf page 338:}  In note two, lines three--four should read:
    ``have a friend gently toss {\bf an} object at you.'' %copyeditor

  \item {\bf page 338:}  Second line after Section 31.3.  It should be
    $\beta = 2.667$.

% pp 338-349:  inconsistencies with parameter values.  sometimes I

  \item {\bf page 390:} Paragraph three, lines nine--ten, should read:
    ``...some aspects of Gleick's book appeared {\bf in a } subsequent
    issue...''  % this one is my fault.
