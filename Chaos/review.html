<blockquote>&#8220;There is a great deal to like about this book,
  starting with the author's writing style, which I found particularly
  clear and enjoyable. ...  This is an excellent book, and is highly
  recommended. &#8221 &mdash;<b>Mark
  Hunacek</b>, <b><a href="http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/chaos-and-fractals-an-elementary-introduction">MAA
  Reviews</a></b>

<blockquote>&#8220;Despite the low level of assumed knowledge [of his
  readers]... Feldman manages to get a remarkably long way, both in
  conveying an understanding of the concepts of chaotic dynamics and
  fractal geometry and in introducing 
  new mathematical ideas.... Feldman also includes some excellent
  material on the scientific and philosophical and historical context,
  looking at such things as the difference between popular and
  scientific understandings of 'chaos', the historical relationship of
  dynamics to ideas of causality and the Scientific Revolution, the
  difficulty of giving a single definition of 'fractal', the
  difference between mathematical and real fractals, and so
  forth.&#8221 &mdash;<b>Danny 
  Yee</b>, <b><a href="http://dannyreviews.com/h/Chaos_Fractals.html">Danny's 
  Reviews</a></b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;The style of writing is easy on the reader. The
  explanations are clear and illustrated with many diagrams and side
  notes. ...Feldman has produced an excellent book to provide
  a firm foundation of the methods [of chaos and fractals] and it will
  give any reader a very clear understanding of the mathematics
  involved. For anybody wishing to learn about chaos and fractals 
  this book must be read. &#8221 &mdash;<b>John
  Sykes</b>, <b> <a href="http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/viewarticle?data=dGJyMPPp44rp2%2fdV0%2bnjisfk5Ie46bFLs6a3T66k63nn5Kx95uXxjL6urUytqK5JspawUrKsuEm2ls5lpOrweezp33vy3%2b2G59q7Rbevskq0r65Qt5zqeezdu33snOJ6u9vzfaTq33%2b7t8w%2b3%2bS7ULOusEuzrrE%2b5OXwhd%2fqu4ji3MSN6uLSffbq&hid=122">Mathematics

<blockquote>&#8220;For the right audience and instructor, this is a wonderful
  book. With considerable effort on both sides it can take a wide
  audience with modest mathematics to a reasonable understanding of
  what is behind much of the complex phenomena seen in modern
  mathematical models of the physical universe.&#8221 &mdash;<b>Thomas
  B. Ward</b>,<b> <a href="http://zbmath.org/?q=an:1252.37001">Zentralblatt

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&#8220;The only textbook on chaos and fractals for non-science and
mathematics majors. Covers central phenomena and ideas of chaos and
fractals in a careful, intellectually honest, but accessible
way.&#8221; &mdash;<b>L'Ensiegnement Mathématique  (2) 59 </b>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
&#8220;As the title suggests, this book provides a good introduction
to chaos and fractals at an elementary level, with only some
elementary algebra being assumed. No previous study of either calculus
or physics is needed. The author has a talent for providing clear
succinct explanations in very simple, easily understood language and
the reader is gently led into more and more complex ideas and
concepts.&#8221; &mdash;<b>Allan Duncan</b>, Scottish Mathematical
Council Journal
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&#8220;Chaos and fractals are two intertwined concepts that have
revolutionized many areas of science and renewed popular interest in
mathematics over the past few decades. Feldman's book is a rich
resource for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of these subjects
without the need for advanced mathematics.&#8221; &mdash;<b>Julien
    Clinton Sprott</b>, University of Wisconsin-Madison
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
&#8220;David P. Feldman provides a delightful and thoughtful
introduction to chaos and fractals requiring only a good background in
algebra. The formal treatment of nonlinear dynamics, chaotic behavior,
Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions is leavened with creative
analogies and many helpful and visually attractive figures and
diagrams. Even more mathematically sophisticated readers will find
this book a good starting point in exploring the complex and beguiling
realms of chaos and fractals.&#8221; &mdash;<b>Robert C. Hilborn</b>,
Associate Executive Officer, American Association of Physics Teachers
