David Feldman is <a href="http://hornacek.coa.edu/dave/"><b>Professor of
  Physics and Mathematics</b></a> at
  the <a http="http://www.coa.edu/"><b>College of the
  Atlantic</b></a>.  He has been on the faculty at COA since 1998.  At
  COA he has taught over twenty different classes in physics,
  mathematics, and computer science.  Among these is <i>Introduction
  to Chaos and Fractals</i>, an introductory course for students with
  a preparation in algebra.  His positive experiences teaching this
  class prompted him to write this book.  Dave served as Associate
  Dean for Academic Affairs from 2003-2007.  <p>

  
Dave received a B.A. in Physics from Carleton College in
  1991 and a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of California at
  Davis in 1998. From 1991-1993 he was a teacher of 9th and 10th
  grade physics and mathematics in Chattanooga, TN. <p>
<!--As a graduate student at UC Davis, Dave received several awards
  in recognition of both teaching and scholarship: The Dissertation
  Year Fellowship; The Chancellor's Teaching Fellowship; and he was
  nominated for the Outstanding Graduate Student Teaching Award. 
-->
Dave was a U.S. Fulbright Lecturer in Rwanda in 2011-12.  He was a
visiting professor in the Department of Applied Physics at the Kigali
Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), in Kigali, Rwanda.  At
KIST he taught five courses over two semesters and supervised three
senior research projects.  <p>

 
<!--Dave has recently become interested in teaching about renewable energy
and energy conservation. With Anna E. Demeo, a lecturer at COA in
engineering, he has developed and team-taught an introductory course
on the physics and mathematics of sustainable energy. Anna and Dave
received a $95,000 grant from the Maine Space Grant Consortium
Research and Higher Education Program to support the development of
the class. Anna and Dave have also received an $18,000 grant from the
Environmental Education Program of the Environmental Protection Agency
to develop and teach a workshop on sustainable energy for area
elementary school teachers. This workshop will be held in the summer
of 2011. -->


<p>Dave has developed and taught two massive online open courses
  (MOOCs), <a href="http://chaos.complexityexplorer.org"><b>Introduction
  to Dynamical Systems and Chaos</b></a> and 
  <a href="http://fractals.complexityexplorer.org"><b>Fractals and
  Scaling</b></a> Both courses are offered on the Santa Fe
  Institute's <a href="http://www.complexityexplorer.org">Complexity
  Explorer</a> platform.
 These two classes are currently the two highest-rated math MOOC
  according
  to <a href="https://www.class-central.com/subject/maths?sort=rating-up">class-
central.com</a>,
  a MOOC aggregation and rating site. 
</p>


<p>Dave was faculty member and co-director of the China
Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS), co-sponsored by the Santa Fe
Institute and the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences in Beijing. <!--His lectures provided students with a
broad introduction to complex systems, including dynamical systems,
information theory, and computation theory. From 2006-2008 he was
co-director of the China CSSS,-->  He collaborated with colleagues at
  the Chinese Academy to oversee academic and logistical aspects of the
program. He was PI on a $116,000 grant from the U.S. National Science
Foundation that partially supported the CSSS. In 2017 he will serve
as the director of the CSSS in Santa Fe.<p>


Dave's research interests lie in the fields of statistical mechanics
and nonlinear dynamics. In particular, his research has examined how
one might measure "complexity" or pattern in a mathematical system,
and how such complexity is related to disorder. <!--This work belongs to
the constellation of research topics often referred to as "chaos and
complex systems".--> In his research, Dave uses both analytic and
computational techniques. <p>
<!--Dave has authored research papers in
journals including Physical Review E, Chaos, and Advances in Complex
Systems. He has recently begun a research project looking at trends in
extreme precipitation events in Maine. -->

His other interests include ultimate frisbee, hockey, cooking, homebrewing,
travel,
  and gardening. He is married to Doreen Stabinsky; they have three
  excellent cats.
